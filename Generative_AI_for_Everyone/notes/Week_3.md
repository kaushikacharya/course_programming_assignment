# Generative AI in Business and Society

## Generative AI and business

### Day-to-day usage of web UI LLMs

- Examples:
  - Writing assistant
  - Marketer
  - Programmer

### Task analysis of jobs

- Idetifying automation opportunities
  - Most jobs involve a collection of many tasks.
  - AI doesn't automate jobs. It automates tasks.
- Augmentation vs Automation
- Evaluating AI potential
  - The potential for augmenting/automating a task depends on:
    - Technical feasibility
    - Business value

### Addiitional job analysis examples

### New workflows and new opportunities

### Teams to build generative AI software

### Concerns about AI

- Concern 1: Amlpifying humanity's worst impulses
  - LLMs are becoming less biased through fine-tuing and more advanced techniques such as RLHF.

- RLHF
  - Reduce bias:
    - Step 1: Train an answer quality (reward) model.
    - Step 2: Have LLM generate a lot of responses. Further train it to generate more responses that get high scores.
  
- Concern 2: Job loss

- Concern 3: Human extinction

### Artificial General Intelligence

- Definition
  - AI that can do any intellectual task that a human can
- We can use large language models as reasoning engines.

### Responsible AI

- Dimensions of responsible AI
  - Fairness
  - Transparency
  - Privacy
  - Security
  - Ethical use
