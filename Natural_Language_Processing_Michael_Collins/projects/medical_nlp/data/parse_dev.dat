We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in NF-kappaB activation by proinflammatory cytokines was cell specific .
However , the sources for ROIs in various cell types are yet to be determined and might include 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and NADPH oxidase .
5-LOX and 5-LOX activating protein ( FLAP ) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells .
Stimulation of lymphoid cells with interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) led to ROI production and NF-kappaB activation , which could both be blocked by antioxidants or FLAP inhibitors , confirming that 5-LOX was the source of ROIs and was required for NF-kappaB activation in these cells .
IL-1beta stimulation of epithelial cells did not generate any ROIs and NF-kappaB induction was not influenced by 5-LOX inhibitors .
However , reintroduction of a functional 5-LOX system in these cells allowed ROI production and 5-LOX-dependent NF-kappaB activation .
In monocytic cells , IL-1beta treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the 5-LOX enzyme but requires the NADPH oxidase activity .
This pathway involves the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases , two enzymes which are not required for NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta in epithelial cells .
In conclusion , three different cell-specific pathways lead to NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta : a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5-LOX in lymphoid cells , an ROI- and 5-LOX-independent pathway in epithelial cells , and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells .
Fas ( CD95 ) and Fas ligand ( CD95L ) are an interacting receptor-ligand pair required for immune homeostasis .
Lymphocyte activation results in the upregulation of Fas expression and the acquisition of sensitivity to FasL-mediated apoptosis .
Although Fas upregulation is central to the preservation of immunologic tolerance , little is known about the molecular machinery underlying this process .
To investigate the events involved in activation-induced Fas upregulation , we have examined mRNA accumulation , fas promoter activity , and protein expression in the Jurkat T-cell line treated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin ( P/I ) , pharmacological mimics of T-cell receptor activation .
Although resting Jurkat cells express Fas , Fas mRNA was induced approximately 10-fold in 2 h upon P/I stimulation .
Using sequential deletion mutants of the human fas promoter in transient transfection assays , we identified a 47-bp sequence ( positions -306 to -260 relative to the ATG ) required for activation-driven fas upregulation .
Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized composite binding site for both the Sp1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors at positions -295 to -286 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift analyses of this region documented constitutive binding of Sp1 in unactivated nuclear extracts and inducible binding of p50-p65 NF-kappaB heterodimers after P/I activation .
Sp1 and NF-kappaB transcription factor binding was shown to be mutually exclusive by EMSA displacement studies with purified recombinant Sp1 and recombinant p50 .
The functional contribution of the kappaB-Sp1 composite site in P/I-inducible fas promoter activation was verified by using kappaB-Sp1 concatamers ( -295 to -286 ) in a thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter construct and native promoter constructs in Jurkat cells overexpressing IkappaB-alpha .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the critical guanine nucleotides in the kappaB-Sp1 element documented the essential role of this site in activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
Recent studies show that human osteoclasts develop in vitro from hematopoietic cells ; however , special cultures conditions and/or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood are apparently required .
Here , we report that cells expressing osteoclast markers differentiate from precursors present in nonmobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , without the addition of stromal cells , growth factors , cytokines or steroids ; and characterize their phenotype .
Three days after establishing high-density PBMC cultures ( 1.5 x 10(6) cells/cm2 ) , in serum-containing medium , small adherent colonies of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive ( TRAP+ ) cells emerge , amidst massive monocyte cell death .
These adherent cells have an eccentrically placed , round nucleus , and express low levels of TRAP and sodium fluoride-resistant- alpha-naphthyl-acetate-esterase ( NaF-R-NSE ) .
Over the next week , this cell population accumulates phenotypic markers of osteoclasts ( vitronectin receptor [ VR ] , calcitonin receptor , TRAP , cathepsin K protein , and mRNA ) with increased nuclearity , covering the entire surface by 15 days .
When cultured on bone , VR+ , TRAP+ cells of low multinuclearity appear and cover up to 50 % of the surface .
Resorption lacunae can be observed by day 22 .
Although these pits are not nearly as numerous as the cells of preosteoclast phenotype , they do represent the activity of a subset of osteoclast-like cells that has achieved osteoclastic maturity under these culture conditions .
Transcripts for osteoprotegerin ligand ( OPGL ) , an osteoclast differentiation factor ( also known as RANKL and TRANCE ) are expressed , likely by adherent cells .
Thus , an adherent population of cells , with preosteoclast/osteoclast phenotypic properties , arises selectively under simple culture conditions from normal PBMC .
Further characterization of these cells should identify factors involved in the growth , terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts .
The aetiology of endometriosis , a common and disabling disorder , is presently unknown , although immune dysfunction could allow ectopic endometrial fragments to survive outside the uterine cavity .
These studies investigate the relationship between leukocyte populations , steroid hormone receptor expression , proliferative activity , bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis or adenomyosis at different phases of the menstrual cycle .
Significantly increased oestrogen receptor expression , bcl-2 expression and numbers of CD8+ leukocytes were found in ectopic compared with eutopic endometrium in endometriosis , and CD56+ endometrial granulated lymphocytes ( eGLs ) were significantly reduced in ectopic endometrium .
Apoptotic cells were rarely found in control and subject endometria .
In contrast with endometriosis , adenomyotic lesions showed identical steroid hormone receptor expression , proliferative activity , bcl-2 expression and leukocyte subpopulations to eutopic endometrium , indicating different aetiologies for these disorders .
The unusual CD56+ CD16- eGLs present in large numbers in late secretory phase eutopic endometrium were highly purified ( > 98 % ) by immunomagnetic separation .
Except for a negligible cytotoxic activity of eGLs from early proliferative samples , cytotoxic activity of eGLs from non-pregnant endometrium during the menstrual cycle was comparable with those in peripheral blood , predominantly CD56+ CD16+ natural killer cells .
eGLs from non-pregnant endometrium and early pregnancy showed a variable proliferative response to 5 and 100 U/ml interleukin-2 over 48-h and 120-h time courses .
eGLs are evidently functionally important in the eutopic endometrium .
Their absence in endometriotic lesions together with increased CD+8 T-cell numbers and increased oestrogen receptor and bcl-2 expression may have significant effects on the development and progression of endometriosis .
CTCF is a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene .
Although CTCF has been characterized in some detail , there is very little information about the regulation of CTCF activity .
Therefore we investigated CTCF expression and phosphorylation during induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells .
We found that : ( i ) both CTCF mRNA and protein are down-regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested ; ( ii ) CTCF down-regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of c-myc ; ( iii ) CTCF protein is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway .
We concluded that CTCF expression and activity is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels .
The GATA-3 transcription factor is required for development of the T-cell lineage and Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T-cells .
We have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive ( HS ) regions of the human GATA-3 gene in T-cells and non-T-cells and studied their transcriptional activities .
HS I-III , located 5' from the transcriptional initiation site , were found in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells , whereas HS IV-VII , located 3' from the transcriptional start site , were exclusively observed in T-cells .
Among these hypersensitive sites , two transcriptional control elements were found , one in the first intron of the GATA-3 gene and the other between 8.3 and 5.9 kilobases 5' from the GATA-3 transcriptional initiation site .
The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity .
The upstream regulatory element could confer T-cell specificity to the GATA-3 promoter activity , and analysis of this region revealed a 707-base pair silencer that drastically inhibited GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells .
Two CAGGTG E-boxes , located at the 5'- and 3'-ends of the silencer , were necessary for this silencer activity .
The 3'-CAGGTG E-box could bind USF proteins , the ubiquitous repressor ZEB , or the basic helix-loop-helix proteins E2A and HEB , and we showed that a competition between ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins is involved in the silencer activity .
X chromosome inactivation and polymorphism of the human androgen receptor ( HUMARA ) gene has been applied for analyzing the clonality of blood cells .
In the present study , the clonal relationship was investigated between peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells ( PMNCs ) and marrow progenitor cells and the origin of ringed sideroblasts in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts ( RARS ) by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) of HUMARA gene .
The X-inactivation patterns of circulating PMNCs and T lymphocytes as well as individual granulocyte colonies grown in vitro from bone marrow cells were analyzed .
The development of ringed sideroblasts in erythroid colonies by iron staining and their X-inactivation pattern were also examined .
All three RARS patients showed monoclonal PMNCs .
In granulocyte colonies , however , two different X-inactivation patterns were observed in all patients , indicating that non-clonal progenitor cells remained in the bone marrow .
All erythroid colonies consisted of ringed sideroblasts exclusively showed one pattern dominant in those of PMNCs .
Our findings suggest that non-clonal progenitor cells persist in some RARS cases , that erythroid progenitors show mosaicism , and that ringed sideroblasts may be derived from an abnormal clone involved in the pathogenesis of this disease .
Increased oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been linked to the development of late diabetic complications .
To determine whether oxidative stress dependent NF-kappaB activation is evident in patients with diabetic nephropathy we used an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay based semiquantitative detection system which enabled us to determine NF-kappaB activation in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
We examined 33 patients with diabetes mellitus ( Type I and Type II ) .
Patients with diabetic nephropathy showed higher NF-kappaB binding activity in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and stronger immunohistological staining for activated NF-kappaBp65 than patients without renal complications .
NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with the degree of albuminuria ( r = 0.316 ) and with thrombomodulin plasma concentrations ( r = 0.33 ) , indicative for albuminuria associated endothelial dysfunction .
In a 3 day intervention study in which 600 mg of the antioxidant thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) per day were given to nine patients with diabetic nephropathy oxidative stress in plasma samples was decreased by 48 % and NF-kappaB binding activity in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 38 % .
In conclusion , activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with diabetes mellitus correlates with the degree of diabetic nephropathy .
NF-kappaB activation is at least in part dependent on oxidative stress since thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) reduced NF-kappaB binding activity .
NF-kappaB is a potent cellular activator of HIV-1 gene expression .
Down-regulation of NF-kappaB activation is known to inhibit HIV replication from the latently infected cells .
Gold compounds have been effectively used for many decades in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis .
We previously reported that gold compounds , especially aurothioglucose ( AuTG ) containing monovalent gold ion , inhibited the DNA-binding of NF-kappaB in vitro .
In this report we have examined the efficacy of the gold compound AuTG as an inhibitor of HIV replication in latently infected OM10.1 and Ach2 cells .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha-induced HIV-1 replication in OM10.1 or Ach2 cells was significantly inhibited by non-cytotoxic doses of AuTG ( > 10 microM in OM10.1 cells and > 25 F.M in Ach2 cells ) , while 25 microM of the counter-anion thioglucose ( TG ) or gold compound containing divalent gold ion , HAuCl3 , had no effect .
The effect of AuTG on NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression was confirmed by a transient CAT assay .
Specific staining as well as electron microscopic examinations revealed the accumulation of metal gold in the cells , supporting our previous hypothesis that gold ions could block NF-kappaB-DNA binding by a redox mechanism .
These observations indicate that the monovalent gold compound AuTG is a potentially useful drug for the treatment of patients infected with HIV .
Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells , promoting IgE synthesis by B cells .
The molecular basis for increased IL-4 gene expression in atopy is not fully understood .
IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors , of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells .
Recently , a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse .
In a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts of highly polarized Th2 clones from atopics and Th1 clones from controls we compared DNA-binding activities at the two NFAT-binding elements P0 and P1 of the crucial proximal human IL-4 promoter .
At the most proximal P0 site , NFAT-containing complexes devoid of NFAT2 were readily inducible in the Th1 clones , but hardly or not in the Th2 clones .
In contrast , both in Th1 and Th2 clones NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the P1 site , consisting of NFAT2 and a P0-compatible NFAT activity , without apparent differences between Th1 and Th2 clones .
Like in Th2 clones , suppressed NFAT-P0 complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum IgE levels , but not in control PBMC .
These findings suggest that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level .
OBJECTIVE : The NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the expression of many genes involved in the immune or inflammatory response at the transcriptional level .
The aim of this study was to determine whether distinctive patterns of NF-kappa B activation are seen in different forms of joint disease .
METHODS : The DNA binding activity of these nucleoproteins was examined in purified synovial and peripheral T cells from patients with various chronic rheumatic diseases ( 12 : four with rheumatoid arthritis ; five with spondyloarthropathies ; and three with osteoarthritis ) .
RESULTS : Electrophoretic mobility shift assays disclosed two specific complexes bound to a NF-kappa B specific 32P-labelled oligonucleotide in nucleoproteins extracted from purified T cells isolated from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis .
The complexes consisted of p50/p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers .
Increased NF-kappa B binding to DNA in synovial T cells was observed relative to peripheral T cells .
In non-rheumatoid arthritis , binding of NF-kappa B in synovial T cells was exclusively mediated by p50/p50 homodimers .
CONCLUSION : Overall , the results suggest that NF-kappa B may play a central part in the activation of infiltrating T cells in chronic rheumatoid arthritis .
The activation of this nuclear factor is qualitatively different in rheumatoid synovial T cells to that in other forms of non-rheumatoid arthritis ( for example , osteoarthritis , spondyloarthropathies ) .
The transcription factor NF-ATc is synthesized in three prominent isoforms .
These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis .
Due to a switch from the use of a 3' polyA site to a more proximal polyA site , NF-ATc expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in naive T cells to that of short isoform A in T effector cells .
The relative low binding affinity of cleavage stimulation factor CstF-64 to the proximal polyA site seems to contribute to its neglect in naive T cells .
These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of NF-ATc necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of NF-ATc for gene induction in effector T cells .
N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) is an antioxidant molecule endowed with immunomodulatory properties .
To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T cell responses , we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells ( DC ) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF .
We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .
In parallel , NAC was shown to down-regulate the production of cytokines by DC as well as their surface expression of HLA-DR , CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and CD40 molecules both at the basal state and upon LPS activation .
NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by CD40 engagement .
The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of DC nor their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC .
Finally , we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses , which could be attributed to a defect of DC as APC-independent T cell responses were not inhibited by NAC .
Altogether , our results suggest that NAC might impair the generation of primary immune responses in humans through its inhibitory action on DC .
NF of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) denotes a family of transcription factors that regulate the activation-dependent expression of many immunologically important proteins .
At least four distinct genes encode the various family members , and several isoforms of these have been identified as well .
The overlapping expression patterns and similar in vitro binding and trans-activation activities on various promoter elements of NF-AT-regulated genes suggest some redundancy in the function of these proteins .
However , the phenotypic analysis of NF-AT-deficient mice supports the idea that there are tissue- and gene- specific functions as well .
In this study we have characterized the expression of NF-AT cDNAs in murine mast cells .
The majority of clones identified correspond to two NF-ATc isoforms that differ only in their amino-terminal sequence .
Despite minimal discrepancies in the coding region , there are striking tissue- and cell type-specific differences in isoform expression patterns .
Detection of NF-ATc.alpha mRNA is strictly dependent on cell activation signals in both T and mast cell lines .
In contrast , the beta isoform is expressed at very low constitutive levels in both cell types but is only up-regulated in response to mast cell activation signals delivered through the FcepsilonRI or via calcium ionophores .
These results demonstrate another level of regulation within the NF-AT family that can contribute to cell type-specific gene expression .
We have applied flow cytometry to the investigation of interferon-gamma activation of human monocytes .
This approach uses monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between the native and phosphorylated forms of STAT-1 .
It enables rapid and quantitative assessment of STAT-1 phosphorylation on a discrete cell basis and is both more sensitive and less time consuming than immunoblotting .
Furthermore , it allows for discrimination between a mixture of cells that differ in their response to interferon-gamma .
This approach should allow for the evaluation of different intracellular signaling pathways using a combination of monoclonal reagents that are specific for native and activation modified proteins .
Application of this form of testing should prove valuable in screening for signaling defects in selected patients with recurrent infections .
In addition , this technique should permit dissection of a full range of cellular signaling pathways at the protein level .
BACKGROUND : Abnormalities in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) -dependent phosphorylation system have been recently reported in patients with bipolar disorder .
We evaluated the immunoreactivity of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( protein kinase A ) and 1 of its substrates , Rap1 , in platelets from untreated euthymic , manic , and depressed patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .
METHODS : Platelets were collected from 112 drug-free patients with bipolar disorder ( 52 euthymic , 29 depressed , and 31 manic ) and 62 healthy subjects .
The levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Rap1 were assessed by Western blot analysis , immunostaining , and computer-assisted imaging .
RESULTS : The immunolabeling of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was significantly different among groups ( P < .001 ) , with higher values in untreated depressed and manic patients with bipolar disorder compared with untreated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .
No significant differences were found in the immunolabeling of the regulatory subunits ( type I and type II ) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase .
The immunolabeling of Rap1 was significantly higher ( P < .001 ) in untreated euthymic , depressed , and manic patients than in healthy persons .
CONCLUSIONS : Levels of Rap1 and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase are altered in the platelets of bipolar patients .
These findings may provide clues toward understanding the involvement of cAMP signaling in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder .
Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of kinases .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of human neutrophils is known to result in activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ; however , the upstream activator ( s ) of p38 MAPk is unknown , and consequences of p38 MAPk activation remain largely undefined .
We investigated the MAPk kinase ( MKK ) that activates p38 MAPk in response to LPS , the p38 MAPk isoforms that are activated as part of this pathway , and the functional responses affected by p38 MAPk activation .
Although MKK3 , MKK4 , and MKK6 all activated p38 MAPk in experimental models , only MKK3 was found to activate recombinant p38 MAPk in LPS-treated neutrophils .
Of p38 MAPk isoforms studied , only p38alpha and p38delta were detected in neutrophils .
LPS stimulation selectively activated p38alpha .
Specific inhibitors of p38alpha MAPk blocked LPS-induced adhesion , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) activation , and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Inhibition of p38alpha MAPk resulted in a transient decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation but persistent loss of TNF-alpha synthesis .
These findings support a pathway by which LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of MKK3 , which in turn activates p38alpha MAPk , ultimately regulating adhesion , NF-kappaB activation , enhanced gene expression of TNF-alpha , and regulation of TNF-alpha synthesis .
In response to hypoxia , sickle red blood cells ( SS RBC ) and leukocytes exhibit increased adherence to the vascular endothelium , while diapedesis of leukocytes through the blood vessel increases .
However , the cellular signaling pathway ( s ) caused by hypoxia is poorly understood .
We utilized CoCl2 as a mimetic molecule for hypoxia to study cellular signaling pathways .
We found that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , CoCl2 at 2 mM concentration induced the surface expression of a subset of CAMs ( VCAM-1 ) and activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB in the nuclear extracts of HUVEC .
Furthermore , CoCl2 also caused time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase isoform ERK2 without significantly affecting ERK1 , indicating ERK2 is the preferred substrate for upstream kinase of the MAPK pathway .
Inhibitors of MAP kinase ( PD98059 ) or platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) - receptor antagonist ( CV3988 ) inhibited the CoCl2-induced NF-kappaB activation and VCAM-1 expression .
Augmented expression of VCAM-1 led to increased SS RBC adhesion , inhibitable by a VCAM-1 antibody .
Additionally , CoCl2 caused a two- to threefold increase in the rate of transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells and a twentyfold increase in phosphorylation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules ( PECAM-1 ) .
The transendothelial migration of monocytes was inhibited by an antibody to PECAM-1 .
Both phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and transendothelial migration of monocytes in response to CoCl2 were inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor ( GF109203X ) and augmented by protein phosphatase inhibitor ( Calyculin A ) .
Our data suggests that CoCl2-induced cellular signals directing increased expression of VCAM-1 in HUVEC involve downstream activation of MAP kinase and NF-kappaB , while the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 occurs as a result of activation of PKC .
We conclude that PAF-receptor antagonist inhibits the CoCl2- or hypoxia-induced increase in the adhesion of SS RBC , PECAM-1 phosphorylation , and the concomitant transendothelial migration of monocytes .
Type I interferons ( IFNs ) are a family of cytokines that have antiviral and antiproliferative effects .
Data regarding the processes by which these cytokines transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are becoming increasingly complex .
The most characterized pathway is via JAK-STAT signaling .
Previous studies established a potential role for the Src-family kinase Lck in JAK-STAT signaling .
Therefore , this study was designed to analyze the role of Lck in IFN-alpha signaling by using the Jurkat , JCam ( an Lck-defective cell line derived from Jurkat ) , and JCam/Lck ( JCam cells with Lck restored ) .
The results show that IFN-alpha can induce MAPK activity , but only in cells containing Lck .
Furthermore , STATs1 and -3 are effectively phosphorylated and activated to bind DNA in the absence of Lck expression in IFN-alpha-treated cells .
Finally , the results demonstrate that IFN-alpha exerts an antiproliferative effect in all three cell lines .
These data indicate that Lck and active MAPK do not affect IFN-alpha-induced growth arrest or induction of STAT1s1 and -3 DNA binding ability .

Induction of NFkappaB is a highly regulated process requiring phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IkappaBalpha .
Analyses of the regulation of IkappaBalpha in TNF-alpha-treated T lymphocytes from young and elderly donors revealed severely compromised degradation of IkappaBalpha in T cells from the elderly .
Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha did not demonstrate any significant age-related alterations .
However , examination of proteasome activity in these T cells using fluorogenic peptide assays revealed a significant age-related decline in chymotryptic activity .
These results suggest that a decline in proteasome activity results in a failure to fully degrade IkappaBalpha in the elderly .
This failure to degrade IkappaBalpha may underlie both the observed decrease in NFkappaB induction and the IL-2 receptor expression in TNF-treated T cells during aging .
Thus , decreased proteasome-mediated degradation may be central to immune dysfunction that accompanies aging .

Our investigations have focused on localizing cis-elements responsible for the down regulation of the adult beta-like globin genes ( delta and beta ) in immature , or primitive erythroid tissues .
We studied their activity after transfection into K562 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line with an embryonic-fetal phenotype .
Analyzed DNA sequences included delta and beta 5' flanking regions extending from approximately -500 to +50bp ( promoter regions ) , truncated delta and beta 5' flanking regions extending from approximately -250 to +50 bp , and chimeric promoter constructions , which consisted of a distal delta or beta fragment fused to a proximal beta or delta sequence .
In CAT reporter constructions no appreciable level of CAT activity was supported by the beta globin promoter , and only low level activity by the delta promoter .
Truncation of the beta globin promoter led to a 2-3 fold increase in promoter activity .
In contrast , deletion of the upstream portion of the delta promoter led to a 10 fold decrease in expression .
Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity , consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element ( s ) .
Fusion of the upstream portion of the delta promoter to the truncated beta globin promoter yielded a modest increase in promoter strength relative to the truncated beta gene promoter , indicating the presence of a positive transcriptional element ( s ) in the upstream delta globin regulatory region .
Site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites for the repressor proteins BP1 and BP2 in the upstream portion of the beta globin gene flanking region led to a 4-6 fold increase in promoter activity .
DNase I footprinting of the upstream delta-globin region revealed protected sequences corresponding to consensus binding sites for GATA-1 and BP2 .
These results confirm that sequences in the upstream promoter region of the adult beta globin gene contribute to its factor-mediated suppression early in development and then may modulate its expression at a later stage .
Recent evidence indicates that the rate of progression of the HIV-1 disease is significantly reduced in thalassaemia major patients upon treatment with high doses of desferrioxamine ( DFX ) .
The authors have previously demonstrated that in vitro exposure of mononuclear cells to DFX decreases the bioavailability of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) which has a stimulatory effect on HIV-1 replication .
In this study , therefore , TNF-alpha bioavailability from mononuclear cells isolated from 10 patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia given DFX as compared to 10 untreated subjects has been evaluated .
Evidence is presented showing that DFX treatment reduces TNF-alpha bioavailability ( P < 0.05 ) by inhibiting its steady state ( P < 0.05 ) and by enhancing its inactivation through binding to soluble TNF-alpha receptor type II ( P < 0.05 ) .
We also show that DFX treatment limits the in vivo activation of NF-kappaB , a transcription factor involved in both TNF-alpha gene transcription and TNF-alpha signalling ( P < 0.005 ) .
We conclude that TNF-alpha bioavailability and signalling are impaired in patients upon DFX treatment .
This mechanism may contribute to delayed progression of the HIV-1 infection in vivo .

Our previous results show that recombinant gp41 ( aa565-647 ) , the extracellular domain of HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein , stimulates interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) production in human monocytes .
The signal cascade transducing this effect is not yet clear .
In this study , we examined whether gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways .
gp41 induced cAMP accumulation in monocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed gp41-induced IL-10 production in monocytes .
In contrast , gp41 failed to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as no NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41 .
We also examined the involvement of other signal transduction pathways .
Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase ( rapamycin ) , and Gi protein ( pertussis toxin ) , prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes , while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) ( wortmannin ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( PD 98059 ) did not .
Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may not involve NF-kappaB , MAPK , or PI 3-kinase activation , but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .
The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF-kappaB , which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV-I .
However , the HTLV-I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients .
In this study , we examined the basis for NF-kappaB activation in freshly isolated leukemic cells from ATL patients .
We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients , like HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines , display constitutive NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of IkappaBalpha ( an inhibitor of NF-kappaB ) .
Whereas the NF-kappaB binding activity in Tax-expressing T-cell lines consisted mostly of p50/c-Rel , fresh ATL samples contained p50/p50 and p50/p65 heterodimers .
One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells , TL-Om1 , displayed constitutive NF-kappaB activity , as well as enhanced degradation of IkappaBalpha , despite the lack of detectable Tax expression .
Interestingly , the NF-kappaB in TL-Om1 consists of p50/p50 and p50/p65 like that in fresh primary leukemic cells .
Our results suggest that activation of NF-kappaB occurs through a Tax-independent mechanism in leukemic cells of ATL patients , possibly due to differential NF-kappaB subunit activation .
The maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis by apoptosis is a critical regulatory mechanism in the normal immune system .
The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been shown to play a role in protecting cells against death mediated by TNF
We show here that NF-kappaB also has a role in regulating Fas/APO-1/CD95-mediated death , a major pathway of peripheral T cell death .
Transfection of Jurkat cells with the NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 confers resistance against Fas-mediated apoptosis .
Reciprocally , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the NF-kappaB inhibitor , IkappaB , makes the cells more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
Furthermore , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor rendered a T cell hybridoma more susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis .
Correspondingly , transfection of p50 and p65 provided considerable protection from TCR-mediated apoptosis .
These observations were corroborated by studies on Fas-mediated death in primary T cells .
Concanavalin A-activated cycling T cell blasts from mice that are transgenic for the dominant IkappaB molecule have increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis , associated with a down-regulation of NF-kappaB complexes in the nucleus .
In addition , blocking TNF , itself a positive regulator of NF-kappaB , with neutralizing antibodies renders the cells more susceptible to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis .
In summary , our results provide compelling evidence that NF-kappaB protects against Fas-mediated death and is likely to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance .
The resolution of immune responses is characterized by extensive apoptosis of activated T cells .
However , to generate and maintain immunological memory , some antigen-specific T cells must survive and revert to a resting G0/G1 state .
Cytokines that bind to the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor promote the survival of T cell blasts , but also induce proliferation .
In contrast , soluble factors secreted by stromal cells induce T cell survival in a resting G0/G1 state .
We now report that interferon-beta is the principal mediator of stromal cell-mediated T cell rescue from apoptosis .
Interferon-alpha and -beta promote the reversion of blast T cells to a resting G0/G1 configuration with all the characteristic features of stromal cell rescue ; such as high Bcl-XL expression and low Bcl-2 .
Type I interferons and stromal cells stimulate apparently identical signaling pathways , leading to STAT-1 activation .
We also show that this mechanism may play a fundamental role in the persistence of T cells at sites of chronic inflammation ; suggesting that chronic inflammation is an aberrant consequence of immunological memory .
The IL-2 growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated T lymphocytes during a developing immune response .
IL-2 is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect Ag-activated T cells from programmed cell death .
In several cell types , activation of NF-kappa B and/or activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) has been demonstrated to be extremely important in blocking apoptosis .
To determine whether either or both of these transcription factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to IL-2 , primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation .
The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis .
Similarly , IL-2 neither activates JNK nor increases AP-1 binding activity to a consensus o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) response element .
On the other hand , the growth factor does induce the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 in these cells , as has been previously demonstrated .
These data show that neither NF-kappa B nor AP-1 activation is required for IL-2-mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T cells .
Human myeloid differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation .
Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation , we have investigated translation initiation during human myeloid cell differentiation using the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U-937 monoblastic cell line .
A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway .
The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation , 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 .
Induction of HL-60 and U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages by IFN-gamma or PMA results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1 .
Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also observed when U-937 cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO .
In contrast , treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO , which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells , decreases 4E-BP1 amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount .
Taken together , these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation , specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway .
Phagocyte recognition , uptake , and nonphlogistic degradation of neutrophils and other leukocytes undergoing apoptosis promote the resolution of inflammation .
This study assessed the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on this leukocyte clearance mechanism .
Pretreatment of " semimature " 5-day human monocyte-derived macrophages ( M phi ) for 24 h with methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone , but not the nonglucocorticoid steroids aldosterone , estradiol , and progesterone , potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils .
These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was completely blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did not promote 5-day M phi ingestion of opsonized erythrocytes .
Similar glucocorticoid-mediated potentiation was observed with 5-day M phi uptake of alternative apoptotic " targets " ( eosinophils and Jurkat T cells ) and in uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by alternative phagocytes ( human glomerular mesangial cells and murine M phi elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) .
Importantly , methylprednisolone-mediated enhancement of the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils did not trigger the release of the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 .
Furthermore , longer-term potentiation by methylprednisolone was observed in maturing human monocyte-derived M phi , with greater increases in 5-day M phi uptake of apoptotic cells being observed the earlier glucocorticoids were added during monocyte maturation into M phi .
We conclude that potentiation of nonphlogistic clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by phagocytes is a hitherto unrecognized property of glucocorticoids that has potential implications for therapies aimed at promoting the resolution of inflammatory diseases .
PROBLEM : The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive and immunosuppression-inducing capacities of Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma cell line supernatants ( HCSs ) are not yet completely understood .
The influence on interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-4 and interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production ; IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha- , beta- , and gamma-chain ; and the signaling pathway molecules Janus kinase ( Jak ) 1 , Jak3 , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) 1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 should be investigated .
METHOD OF STUDY : For assessment of IL production , whole peripheral venous blood from healthy donors was stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine .
Secretion of ILs was blocked with monensine .
Intracellular ILs were analyzed by flow cytometry .
For IL-2R and signaling pathway molecule analysis , peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) .
IL-2R chains were measured by flow cytometry , and Jaks/Stats by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and Western blot .
RESULTS : Phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine strongly increase the percent-age of IL-2+ cells ; an additional 50 % HCSs significantly suppresses the percentage to , or below the level of unstimulated cells .
IFN-gamma production is strongly decreased by HCSs in some cases , but not in others .
PHA stimulates IL-2R alpha- , beta- , and gamma-chain expression and their signaling pathway molecules Jak1 , Jak3 , Stat1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 .
50 % HCS downregulates the alpha-chain and slightly upregulates the beta-chain .
Jak1 , Jak3 , Stat1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 expression is suppressed approximately to , or below the level of unstimulated cells .
CONCLUSIONS : HCS forcefully blocks the production of IL-2 ; the IL-2R alpha-chain ; and Jak1 , Jak3 , Stat1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 expression .
The observed phenomena might be caused by downregulation of an IL-2R regulation gene , and might play a key role in the expansion of choriocarcinoma , and possibly in the survival of the fetal allograft .
Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of HNF1 ( PCD/DCoH ) is a dual-function protein .
In the cytoplasm it acts as a dehydratase in the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin , the cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases .
In the nucleus , it functions as a dimerization cofactor of HNF1 and increases the transcriptional activity of HNF1 .
To deepen our understanding of this protein , we characterized its expression in human tissues and cells .
Human PCD/DCoH was present predominantly in liver and kidney , with significant amounts in testis and ovary , trace amounts in lung , and undetectable levels in whole brain , heart , and spleen .
It was expressed in all of the cells that were examined .
Importantly , it was also present in the nucleus of HeLa cells , which lack HNF1 , and in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts that have little or no tetrahydrobiopterin .
The expression of human PCD/DCoH in the liver and nonhepatic cells was compared at both the mRNA and protein levels .
Although the mRNA level in liver was only fourfold higher than that in keratinocytes and fibroblasts , the hepatic PCD/DCoH protein level was 20-fold higher than that in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts .
Cloning of the 5' and 3' untranslated region ( UTR ) of human keratinocyte PCD/DCoH revealed that it has 53 bp more of GC-rich 5' untranslated sequence than the published liver PCD/DCoH .
In vitro transcription and translation analysis showed that the longer 5' UTR resulted in about a 35 % decrease in translation efficiency .
These data show that human PCD/DCoH is not only present in cells where tetrahydrobiopterin is synthesized or HNF1 is present but is a widely distributed protein .
Its differential expression in different tissues and cells is regulated not only at the transcriptional level but also at the translational level .
Glucocorticoids are physiological molecules that are also extensively used in clinics as anti-inflammatory , immunosuppressive or anti-tumoral agents .
Glucocorticoids can induce apoptosis on normal lymphoid cells and play a key role in the physiology of thymic selection .
In clinics these molecules are also used for their potencies in inducing apoptosis of malignant lymphoid cells .
Glucocorticoids are mediating their effects after binding to an intracellular receptor belonging to the steroid receptor superfamily : the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .
Once activated , the GR , can mediate his effects through direct binding on the DNA or via protein/protein interactions with transcription factors .
Depending on the type of lymphocytes , the mechanism of apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids fall roughly in two categories : induction of " death genes " by the activated GR ( I kappa B , c-jun ) or repression of survival factors ( AP-1 , c-Myc ) .
In the case of thymic selection the mechanism is more subtle depending on the mutual repression of Nur77 and GR .
Rat spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes express progesterone receptors whose concentration is increased greatly during the early phase of pregnancy .
After stimulation of progesterone the expression of receptors was augmented 2-3 times .
When cells were cultured in the presence of progesterone they released a soluble factor that inhibited cellular immunoreactions ( MLR , CRC ) and cellular proliferation as measured by thymidine incorporation by spleen-cell culture .
This factor also inhibited the synthesis of anti-DNP antibodies by a mouse hybridoma and diminished the proportion of cells in phase S .
However , the percentage of asymmetric molecules produced by the hybridoma remained unaltered .
These results support the hypothesis that soluble factors released by rat lymphocytes modulate the immune response of the mother and participate in the mechanism that protects the fetus against antipaternal antibodies .
PGG-Glucan , a soluble beta-(1,6)-branched beta-(1,3)-linked glucose homopolymer derived from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is an immunomodulator which enhances leukocyte anti-infective activity and enhances myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitor proliferation .
Incubation of human whole blood with PGG-Glucan significantly enhanced the oxidative burst response of subsequently isolated blood leukocytes to both soluble and particulate activators in a dose-dependent manner , and increased leukocyte microbicidal activity .
No evidence for inflammatory cytokine production was obtained under these conditions .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PGG-Glucan induced the activation of an NF-kappaB-like nuclear transcription factor in purified human neutrophils .
The binding of 3H-PGG-Glucan to human leukocyte membranes was specific , concentration-dependent , saturable , and high affinity ( Kd approximately 6 nM ) .
A monoclonal antibody specific to the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide was able to inhibit activation of the NF-kappaB-like factor by PGG-Glucan , and ligand binding data , including polysaccharide specificity , suggested that the PGG-Glucan binding moiety was lactosylceramide .
These results indicate that PGG-Glucan enhances neutrophil anti-microbial functions and that interaction between this beta-glucan and human neutrophils is mediated by the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide present at the cell surface .
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) is essential for the later stages of erythropoiesis , acting to promote cell survival and proliferation , but its role in differentiation remains to be defined .
The UT-7 cell line exhibits both erythroid and megakaryocytic characteristics and can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid pathway by Epo or the megakaryocytic pathway by phorbol myristic acetate .
We have compared the effects of Epo and the chemical inducers , delta-aminolaevulinic acid ( delta-ALA ) and haemin on the differentiation capacity of UT-7 cells .
Epo alone promoted relatively early events in erythroid maturation , without significant changes in haemoglobin production or morphology .
GATA-2 and c-myb were down-regulated by Epo , and GATA-2 was further down-modulated by the inducers .
Conversely , SCL expression was up-regulated by Epo and further increased by haemin and delta-ALA .
Epo caused an increase in the proportion of cells expressing cell surface glycophorin A ( GPA ) and up-regulated beta- and gamma-globin by several fold .
Both haemin and delta-ALA caused a de novo increase in alpha-globin expression as well as enhancing Epo-induced beta-globin expression , leading to a marked increase in haemoglobin production .
These results suggest that haemoglobin production in UT-7 cells is limited by a deficiency of erythroid-specific aminolaevulinic acid synthase ( ALAS-E ) activity or globin synthesis as a consequence of their immaturity as a multipotential cell line .
X chromosome inactivation patterns at the androgen receptor locus were evaluated to determine clonality in microdissected lesional tissue and in leukocytes from 2 women with Dupuytren 's disease .
The tissue from both patients generated a polyclonal pattern of X chromosome inactivation of the human androgen receptor gene .
This finding supports a polyclonal reactive process as the underlying etiology for palmar fibromatosis .
Soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha ( IL-2Ralpha ) has been reported to be increased in the sera of patients with advanced tuberculosis , and levels decline after therapy in accordance with improvement of radiologic findings .
We investigated expression of the IL-2Ralpha in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells in active pulmonary tuberculosis , and evaluated the mechanism Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces in the IL-2Ralpha using the THP-1 mononuclear phagocyte cell line .
We found IL-2Ralpha expression to be increased in BAL cells from involved sites of active pulmonary tuberculosis .
Expression of the alpha-chain of IL-2Ralpha on peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) was induced by M. tuberculosis by flow cytometry evaluation .
Northern analysis demonstrated increased IL-2Ralpha gene expression after stimulation with M. tuberculosis which was further induced by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
The IL-2Ralpha promoter containing the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) site was transcriptionally induced by M. tuberculosis and this NF-kappaB site could confer inducibility to a heterologous herpes thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter by M. tuberculosis .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) revealed specific binding of nuclear protein to the NF-kappaB site upon induction with M. tuberculosis .
Using antibodies against the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB in EMSAs , the involvement of both p50 and p65 proteins was further demonstrated .
Functional expression of the IL-2Ralpha on mononuclear phagocytes in M. tuberculosis infection may play an important immunomodulatory role in the host response .
Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) , a protein involved in cell transformation , interferes with the cellular response to type I interferons ( IFN-alpha/beta ) .
We investigated the function of conditionally expressed EBNA2 in the context of the IFN response in Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines .
Expression of EBNA2 led to the transcriptional activation of both endogenous or transfected IFN-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) , genes which contain within their promoters either the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) or the gamma interferon activation site ( GAS ) .
In search of a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional induction of ISGs , we observed an EBNA2-dependent synthesis of IFN-beta mRNA at low levels and the secretion of low amounts of IFN .
A transfected IFN-beta promoter responded to EBNA2 activation , and a sequence closely resembling a RBP-Jkappa binding site was pinpointed as a potential target of EBNA2 activity .
EBNA2-dependent transcriptional induction of the IFN-beta promoter occurred in EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells , indicating that other EBV genes were not required for the induction of IFN-beta synthesis .
BACKGROUND : In vivo regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) by glucocorticoids provides a means of modulating sensitivity of targeted cells .
OBJECTIVE : We sought to determine the in vivo modulation of GR mRNA expression by fluticasone propionate ( FP ) in subjects with mild asthma .
METHODS : Ten atopic asthmatic subjects were treated with FP 250 microg twice daily for 4 weeks .
Before and after treatment , the patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy and sampling of venous blood for measurements of GR mRNA levels .
A solution hybridization assay was used for quantitative analysis of GR mRNA .
In addition , a 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and an adrenocorticotropic hormone test before and after treatment with FP were performed .
RESULTS : A high interindividual variation in GR mRNA expression was seen .
However , we detected a significant reduction of the GR mRNA levels in the endobronchial biopsy specimens after FP treatment ( 36.6 +/- 23.1 and 25.0 +/- 10.9 amol GR mRNA/microg RNA , respectively ; P < .01 ) .
In the peripheral blood lymphocytes an even more striking downregulation of the GR by its cognate ligand was documented ( 30.3 +/- 26.5 and 8.8 +/- 5 amol GR mRNA/microg RNA , respectively ; P < .001 ) , possibly reflecting differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity between tissues .
A small but significant reduction of the 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was observed ( 233 +/- 109 and 157 +/- 66 nmol/L , respectively ; P < .01 ) , whereas the feedback regulation of glucocorticoid synthesis by means of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as assessed by the adrenocorticotropic hormone test remained normal after treatment with FP .
CONCLUSION : The results in this study confirm the potency of the inhaled corticosteroid FP and provide evidence for a considerable tissue-specific interindividual variation in the expression of the GR .
IL-12 and IL-2 can stimulate mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells to proliferate , produce IFN-gamma , and kill tumor cells .
The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when T cells are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
Although peripheral blood T cells are largely unresponsive to these cytokines without prior activation , a small subset of CD8+ T cells ( CD8+CD18bright ) is strongly activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
In this report we show that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in CD8+CD18bright T cells correlates with the activation of the stress kinases , p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) /Jun N-terminal kinase , but not with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases .
The functional synergy between IL-2 and IL-12 is also associated with a prominent increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with IL-12 or IL-2 alone .
By contrast , STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is not augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone .
A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by IL-12 and IL-2 and abrogates the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation .
This suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
Furthermore , these findings indicate that the optimal activation of T cells by IL-12 and IL-2 may depend on an interaction between the p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathways .
Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen .
Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions .
In this study , we characterized C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of endothelial cells and demonstrated an enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of leukocytes ( monocytes , granulocytes ) .
These effects were blocked by mAbs against endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules ( beta1 and beta2 integrins ) .
Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in C. pneumoniae-infected endothelial cells was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and NF-kappaB activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min .
Increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted within hours .
Thus , C. pneumoniae triggers a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial activation , inflammation , and thrombosis , which in turn may result in or may promote atherosclerosis .
In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in mediating IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes , in particular their role in enhancing NF-kappa B activity .
Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL-6 protein , which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF-kappa B as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK proteins .
The ERK pathway-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IL-6 secretion from monocytes .
Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either Raf-1 or JNK1 showed that both pathways were involved in kappa B-dependent IL-6 promoter activity .
By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B .
Interestingly , it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein .
We conclude that okadaic acid-induced IL-6 gene expression is at least partly mediated through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway-dependent activation of NF-kappa B transcriptional capacity .
Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun .
Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies that can induce severe and prolonged immunosuppression .
Although it can be incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells , fludarabine is also a potent inhibitor of cells with a low growth fraction , thus it must have other mechanisms of action .
STAT1 , which is activated in response to many lymphocyte-activating cytokines including the interferons , is essential for cell-mediated immunity , as the absence of this protein is associated with prominent defects in the ability to control viral infections .
Here we show that fludarabine , but not the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A , inhibits the cytokine-induced activation of STAT1 and STAT1-dependent gene transcription in normal resting or activated lymphocytes .
Fludarabine caused a specific depletion of STAT1 protein ( and mRNA ) but not of other STATs .
This loss of STAT1 was also seen in cells from patients treated with fludarabine in vivo .
Brief exposure to fludarabine led to a sustained loss of STAT1 , analogous to the prolonged period of immunosuppression induced by exposure to the drug in vivo .
Thus , STAT1 may be a useful target in the development of new immunosuppressive and antineoplastic agents .
BACKGROUND : Studies from our laboratory have shown that the earliest stages of atherosclerosis may be mediated by an autoimmune reaction against heat shock protein 60 ( Hsp60 ) .
The interactions of Hsp60-specific T cells with arterial endothelial cells ( EC ) require expression of both Hsp60 and certain adhesion molecules shown to be induced simultaneously in EC by mechanical and other types of stress .
Recently , it was shown that suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses by cyclosporin A ( CyA ) enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice .
In contrast , aspirin was found to lower the risk of myocardial infarction in men .
These conflicting observations may be due to different effects of anti-inflammatory agents on adhesion molecule and Hsp expression in EC , respectively .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : In the present study , we analyzed the effects of CyA , aspirin , and indomethacin on T cell proliferation using a proliferation assay .
To explore the expression of adhesion molecules , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , and Hsp60 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , Northern blot analyses were used .
To examine the activation status of the transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and heat shock factor-1 ( HSF-1 ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed .
RESULTS : With the exception of indomethacin , the used immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents significantly inhibited T cell proliferation in response to influenza virus antigen in a dose-dependent manner .
Interestingly , CyA and indomethacin did not suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -induced adhesion molecule expression on HUVECs , whereas aspirin had an inhibitory effect .
These observations correlated with the modulation of NF-kappaB activity in EC .
All agents tested induced expression of Hsp60 6 hr after application .
In addition , aspirin and indomethacin , but not CyA , induced Hsp70 expression in HUVECs that correlated with induction of HSF-1 activity .
CONCLUSION : Our results show that the tested agents ( except indomethacin ) are inhibitors of the T cell-mediated immune response , as expected , that aspirin is an effective suppressor of adhesion molecule expression , and that all three agents can induce Hsp60 in HUVECs .
These data provide the molecular basis for the notion that ( 1 ) part of the anti-atherogenic effect of aspirin may be due to the prevention of the adhesion of sensitized T cells to stressed EC ; ( 2 ) that part of the atherosclerosis-promoting effect of CyA may be due to its potential as an inducer of Hsp60 expression and its inability to down-regulate adhesion molecule expression on EC ; and ( 3 ) that down-regulation of MCP-1 expression by aspirin may result in decreased recruitment of monocytes into the arterial intima beneath stressed EC .
Increased activity of various proteases is observed in both human and experimental pancreatitis ; however , the information on the effects of specific protease inhibitors on the disease is limited .
In this study we show that a novel elastase inhibitor , guamerin-derived synthetic peptide ( GDSP ) , improves the parameters of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat .
The effects of GDSP on pancreatic weight , serum amylase and lipase , morphologic changes in the pancreas , neutrophil infiltration , and nuclear factor KB ( NF-KB ) activation were measured in rats infused with supramaximal dose of cerulein ( 5 ( g/kg/h ) for 6 h .
The effects of GDSP were also measured on superoxide formation by activated human neutrophils .
The effects of GDSP were compared with those of another elastase inhibitor , elastatinal .
GDSP significantly inhibited edema formation , neutrophil infiltration , acinar cell damage , and plasma lipase and amylase increases caused by cerulein .
GDSP also completely inhibited superoxide formation in the human neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenyl-alanine ( fMLP ) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
Elastatinal had some of the same effects as GDSP but was less potent and effective .
These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of GDSP , a novel specific elastase inhibitor , on the development of rat cerulein pancreatitis .
Activation of T lymphocytes to produce cytokines is regulated by the counterbalance of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases , many of which have a high degree of substrate specificity because of physical association with their targets .
Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5' promoter of the interleukin-2 gene .
Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells .
In contrast , HePTP had no effects on N-terminal c-Jun kinase or on events upstream of the MAP kinases .
The specificity of HePTP correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic N terminus with Erk and another MAP kinase , p38 , but not Jnk or other proteins .
We propose that HePTP plays a negative role in antigen receptor signaling by specifically regulating MAP kinases in the cytosol and at early time points of T cell activation before the activation-induced expression of nuclear dual-specific MAP kinase phosphatases .
The pocket protein-E2F complexes are convergence points for cell cycle signaling .
In the present report , we identified and monitored the pocket protein-E2F complexes in human primary B-lymphocytes after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
Consistent with previous data from human and mouse fibroblasts and T-lymphocytes , E2F4 and DP1 form the predominant E2F heterodimers both in G0 and G1 phases of the human B-lymphocyte cell cycle , whereas E2F1 and -3 are first detected in late G1 , and their expression levels increase towards S phase .
Intriguingly , the major E2F complex that we detected in quiescent human B-lymphocytes is consisted of pRB , E2F4 , and DP1 .
Though the levels of DP1 and -2 increase when cells progress from G0 to S , the proportion of DP1 to DP2 remains relatively constant during the cell cycle .
We also observed an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the predominant E2F components , DP1 and E2F4 , as B-lymphocytes progressed from G0 into early G1 .
This increase in mobility was attributable to dephosphorylation , as lambda phosphatase treatment could convert the slower migrating forms into the corresponding faster mobility forms .
We further demonstrated that this change in phosphorylation status correlates with a decrease in DNA binding activity .
This modulation of DNA binding activity mediated through the dephosphorylation of DP1 and E2F4 could help to explain the lack of in vivo DNA footprinting in late G1 and S phases of gene promoters negatively regulated through E2F sites and suggests a novel mechanism for controlling E2F transcriptional activity during the transition from quiescence to proliferation .
The renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
A common feature of all stages of atherosclerosis is inflammation of the vessel wall .
The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation .
This study therefore examined the effect of angiotensin ( ANG ) II on NF-kappaB activation in monocytic cells , a major cellular component of human atheroma , by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
ANG II , like TNFalpha , caused rapid activation of NF-kappaB in human mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density gradient .
This ANG II effect was blocked by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan .
Specificity of ANG II-induced NF-kappaB activation was ascertained by supershift and competition experiments .
Moreover , ANG II stimulated NF-kappaB activation in human monocytes , but not in lymphocytes from the same preparation .
Together , the data demonstrate the ability of the vasoactive peptide ANG II to activate inflammatory pathways in human monocytes .

T lymphocytes express several low molecular weight transmembrane adaptor proteins that recruit src homology ( SH ) 2 domain-containing intracellular molecules to the cell membrane via tyrosine-based signaling motifs .
We describe here a novel molecule of this group termed SIT ( SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein ) .
SIT is a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in lymphocytes .
After tyrosine phosphorylation by src and possibly syk protein tyrosine kinases SIT recruits the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif .
Overexpression of SIT in Jurkat cells downmodulates T cell receptor- and phytohemagglutinin-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) by interfering with signaling processes that are probably located upstream of activation of phospholipase C .
However , binding of SHP2 to SIT is not required for inhibition of NF-AT induction , suggesting that SIT not only regulates NF-AT activity but also controls NF-AT unrelated pathways of T cell activation involving SHP2 .
Propagation of signals from the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) involves a number of adaptor molecules .
SH2 domain-containing protein 76 ( SLP-76 ) interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav to activate the nuclear factor of activated cells ( NF-AT ) , and its expression is required for normal T cell development .
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel Grb2-like adaptor molecule designated as Grb2-related protein of the lymphoid system ( GrpL ) .
Expression of GrpL is restricted to hematopoietic tissues , and it is distinguished from Grb2 by having a proline-rich region .
GrpL can be coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 but not with Sos1 or Sos2 from Jurkat cell lysates .
In contrast , Grb2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Sos1 and Sos2 but not with SLP-76 .
Moreover , tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT/pp36/38 in detergent lysates prepared from anti-CD3 stimulated T cells associated with Grb2 but not GrpL .
These data reveal the presence of distinct complexes involving GrpL and Grb2 in T cells .
A functional role of the GrpL-SLP-76 complex is suggested by the ability of GrpL to act alone or in concert with SLP-76 to augment NF-AT activation in Jurkat T cells .
Most erythroleukemic cell lines established in vitro coexpress erythrocytic and megakaryocytic markers that often are associated with expression of Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 transcription factors known as transactivators of megakaryocyte-specific promoters .
In the present study , we examined the possibility of establishing new cell lines keeping strictly erythroid-specific properties in vitro through the targeted and conditional immortalization of erythrocytic progenitors .
For that purpose , we established several lines of transgenic mice displaying erythroid-specific expression of a thermosensitive SV40 T antigen .
As expected , these transgenic mice developed splenomegaly due to the massive amplification of Ter 119 positive erythroid nucleated cells expressing T antigen .
Despite this drastic effect in vivo , the in vitro immortalization of erythropoietin-dependent erythroid progenitors unexpectedly occurred at low frequency , and all four cell lines established expressed both erythrocytic ( globins ) and megakaryocytic markers ( glycoprotein IIb , platelet factor 4 ) as well as Spi-1 and Fli-1 transcripts at permissive temperature .
Switching the cells to the nonpermissive temperature led to a marked increase in globin gene expression and concomitant decrease in expression of Spi-1 , Fli-1 , and megakaryocytic genes in an erythropoietin-dependent manner .
Interestingly , enhanced expression of Spi-1 and Fli-1 genes already was detected in the Ter 119 positive cell population of transgenic mice spleen in vivo .
However , like normal Ter 119 erythroid cells , these Ter 119 positive cells from transgenic mice still expressed high levels of beta-globin and very low or undetectable glycoprotein IIb and platelet factor 4 megakaryocytic transcripts .
Taken together , these data indicate that the unexpected expression of megakaryocytic genes is a specific property of immortalized cells that can not be explained only by enhanced expression of Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 genes .
Retinoids are bifunctional regulators of growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells .
In this study we explored the effects of retinoic acid ( RA ) on apoptosis of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from normal bone marrow .
RA ( 100 nM ) induced an increase in the percentage of dead cells from 24 % to 44 % at day 6 ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) as compared to control cells cultured in medium alone .
The effect was dose dependent and appeared relatively late .
Significant differences were observed from day 4 onward .
Apoptosis , or programmed cell death , was demonstrated as the mode of cell death by using the TUNEL assay , which detects single strand nicks in DNA , or by the Nicoletti technique demonstrating a subdiploid population by DNA staining .
RA previously was found to inhibit granulocyte colony-stimulating factor -- and not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor -- stimulated proliferation of CD34+ cells .
However , we found that RA opposed anti-apoptotic effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on CD34+ cells ( G-CSF : 8 % dead cells at day 6 ; G-CSF + RA : 20 % ; GM-CSF : 12 % ; GM-CSF + RA : 27 % ) .
Moreover , RA induced apoptosis of CD34+ cells and CD34+CD71+ cells stimulated with erythropoietin .
To explore the receptor signaling pathways involved in RA-induced apoptosis , we used selective ligands for retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ; RO13-7410 ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ; RO 25-6603 ) .
We found that RARs were involved in RA-mediated apoptosis of myeloid progenitor cells , whereas RARs as well as RXRs were involved in RA-mediated apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells .
The implantation of trophoblast cells at extrauterine sites still results in decidualization .
The objective of the present study was to compare decidualization at eutopic and ectopic implantation sites .
Tissues from women undergoing elective termination of uterine pregnancy and from women with ectopic pregnancy were used to detect the presence of cells important for the maintenance of pregnancy , such as BCL-2+ , CD56+ , CD3+ , CD8+ and CD68+ cells , and the presence of oestrogen ( ER ) and progesterone receptors ( PR ) by immunohistochemistry .
In-situ detection of fragmented DNA was performed to identify apoptotic cells .
The percentage of CD3+ cells among all immunocompetent cells in the tubal epithelium was 46.6 % ( 39.9 % of CD3+ were also CD8+ ) ; the other 53.4 % were CD68+ cells .
CD56+ cells were undetectable in ectopic decidua at the feto-maternal interface in ectopic tissue .
In uterine decidua , we found 29.9 % CD3+ cells ( 2.2 % of CD3+ were CD8+ ) , 51.6 % CD56+ cells and 18.5 % CD68+ cells .
The ratio of BCL2+ to CD3+ cells in ectopic pregnancy was 0.41 .
In uterine pregnancy , the ratio of BCL-2 to CD3 was 0.44 and 0.39 for CD56 .
Tissues from both ectopic and uterine pregnancies were positive for PR .
Fewer apoptotic cell bodies were present in ectopic pregnancy .
The use of tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancy may become an excellent model to identify the mechanism of trophoblast invasion in eutopic pregnancies .
Precise regulation of MHC class II expression plays a crucial role in the control of the immune response .
The transactivator CIITA behaves as a master controller of constitutive and inducible MHC class II gene activation , but its exact mechanism of action is not known .
Activation of MHC class II promoters requires binding of at least three distinct multi-protein complexes ( RFX , X2BP and NF-Y ) .
It is known that the stability of this binding results from cooperative interactions between these proteins .
We show here that expression of CIITA in MHC class II- cells triggers occupation of the promoters by these complexes .
This observation raised the possibility that the effect of CIITA on promoter occupation is mediated by an effect on the cooperative stabilization of the DNA-bound multi-protein complexes .
We show , however , that the presence of CIITA does not affect the stability of the higher-order protein complex formed on DNA by RFX , X2BP and NF-Y .
This suggests other mechanisms for CIITA-induced promoter occupancy , such as an effect on chromatin structure leading to increased accessibility of MHC class II promoters .
This ability of CIITA to facilitate promoter occupation is undissociable from its transactivation potential .
Finally , we conclude that this effect of CIITA is cell-type specific , since expression of CIITA is not required for normal occupation of MHC class II promoters in B lymphocytes .
Cells from the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiate towards a macrophage-like phenotype when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate -13- acetate ( PMA ) , 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 , and various other agents .
We demonstrate here that the expression of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ; E.C.3.1.4.12 ) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated THP-1 cells , as well as in differentiated human mononuclear phagocytes .
Using Northern blotting , RNase protection assay , and nuclear run-on analyses , we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity .
This cell-type specific induction by PMA treatment was further investigated with respect to transcriptional control .
A series of 5' deletion derivatives of the upstream regulatory region were used in transient transfection assays to identify promoter elements required for basal and inducible gene expression .
A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -319 and -219 bp upstream of the initiation codon and co-transfections with transcription factor expression plasmids for AP-2 and Sp1 resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity , which was abolished when the binding sites for these two factors were deleted .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays we demonstrate that this region is specifically bound by Sp1 and AP-2 .
These factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both induced and uninduced THP-1 cells .
However , the intensity of the complex formed appeared to increase when nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells were used .
From these studies , we conclude that a concerted action of the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 is essential for the up -regulation of ASM expression during the process of macrophage differentiation .
BACKGROUND : We reported on the constitutive interferon-gamma receptor ( IFN-gammaR ) expression on eosinophils .
But signal transduction through IFN-gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated .
In this study , we examined the involvement of the Jak/Stat pathway in the signaling of eosinophils after IFN-gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding .
METHODS : Purified peripheral eosinophils were stimulated with IFN-gamma at 37 degrees C for 1-60 min .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR , Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1alpha was examined by immunoblotting .
Gel-shift assay was also examined to show the formation of Stat1alpha-DNA complexes .
RESULTS : We show that binding of IFN-gamma to human eosinophils initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the IFN-gammaRalpha chain but also Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1alpha .
In addition , IFN-gamma enhanced the DNA-binding activity of Stat1alpha .
CONCLUSION : These data indicate that IFN-gamma affects eosinophils through its specific receptor and utilizes the Jak/Stat pathway as its mode of signaling .
Cytokine expression by immune system cells plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response .
On first encounter with antigen , naive CD4+ T helper ( Th ) cells differentiate into cytokine-producing effector cells .
Two types of effector cells characterized by their distinct expression of cytokine profiles have been described .
Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma , whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 .
In many pathological situations , the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses determines the outcome of diverse immunologically mediated clinical syndromes including infectious , autoimmune , and allergic diseases .
However , the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of Th1/Th2-like cytokines has remained elusive .
In this review we evaluate the possible in vivo role of different transcription factors and transcriptional mechanisms in T cell differentiation and the immune response .
Germline C gamma gene transcription is a crucial event in the process that leads to switch DNA recombination to IgG , but its regulation in the human is poorly understood .
We took advantage of our monoclonal model of germinal center B cell differentiation , IgM+ IgD+ CL-01 cells , to define the role of the I gamma 3 evolutionarily conserved sequence ( ECS ) in the germline transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .
The I gamma 3 ECS lies upstream of the major I gamma 3 transcription initiation site and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding human I gamma 1 , I gamma 2 , and I gamma 4 regions .
Reporter luciferase gene vectors containing the human gamma 3 ECS were used to transfect CL-01 cells , which have been shown to undergo Smu --> S gamma 3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of CD40 by CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) and exposure to IL-4 .
In these transfected CL-01 cells , CD40:CD40L engagement and exposure to IL-4 synergistically induced gamma 3 ECS-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation .
Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem NF-kappa B/Rel binding motif is critical for the gamma 3 ECS responsiveness to both CD40L and IL-4 , while a STAT-6-binding site is additionally required for IL-4 inducibility .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that p50/p65/c-Rel and STAT-6 are effectively induced by CD40L and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to specific DNA motifs within the ECS .
These partially overlapping CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation .
Thus , the gamma 3 ECS is an inducible promoter containing cis elements that critically mediate CD40L and IL-4-triggered transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .
Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is manifested as atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the allograft .
HLA class I Ags have been implicated to play a major role in this process , since signaling via HLA class I molecules can induce the proliferation of aortic endothelial as well as smooth muscle cells .
In this study , we show that HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation correlates with inactivation of the Rb protein in the T cell line Jurkat as well as human aortic endothelial cells .
HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb can be inhibited specifically by neutralizing Abs to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , suggesting a role for FGF receptors in the signaling process .
Signaling through HLA class I molecules induced cyclin E-associated kinase activity within 4 h in quiescent endothelial cells , and appeared to mediate the inactivation of Rb .
A cdk2 inhibitor , Olomoucine , as well as a dominant-negative cdk2 construct prevented HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb ; in contrast , dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs had no effect .
Furthermore , there was no increase in cyclin D-associated kinase activity upon HLA class I ligation , suggesting that cyclin E-dependent kinase activity mediates Rb inactivation , leading to E2F activation and cell proliferation .
We investigated the mechanisms by which proinflammatory mediator , thrombin , released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury , induces ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) expression in endothelial cells .
Stimulation of HUVEC with thrombin resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in ICAM-1 mRNA and cell surface expression and in ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes .
Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene ( ICAM-1LUC ) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream NF-kappa B site ( -533 bases from translation start site ) had no effect on thrombin responsiveness , whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-kappa B site ( -223 bases from the translation start site ) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter , indicating that the downstream NF-kappa B site is critical for thrombin inducibility .
NF-kappa B-directed luciferase activity increased approximately 3-fold when cells transfected with the plasmid pNF-kappa BLUC containing five copies of consensus NF-kappa B site linked to a minimal adenovirus E1B promoter-luciferase gene were exposed to thrombin , indicating that activation of NF-kappa B was essential for thrombin response .
Gel supershift assays demonstrated that thrombin induced binding of NF-kappa Bp65 ( Rel A ) to downstream NF-kappa B site of the ICAM-1 promoter .
Thrombin receptor activation peptide , a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH2 terminus of proteolytically activated receptor-1 , mimicked thrombin 's action in inducing ICAM-1 expression .
These data indicate that thrombin activates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion by NF-kappa Bp65 binding to the downstream NF-kappa B site of ICAM-1 promoter after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation .
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) -insensitive asthma is a challenging clinical problem that can be associated with life-threatening disease progression .
The molecular basis of GC insensitivity is unknown .
Alternative splicing of the GC receptor ( GCR ) pre-mRNA generates a second GCR , termed GCRbeta , which does not bind GC but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR .
Thus increased expression of GCRbeta could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity .
Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were examined for GCRbeta immunoreactivity using a GCRbeta-specific antibody by immunohistochemical staining .
Cell localization of GCRbeta expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique .
Patients with GC-insensitive asthma expressed a significantly higher number of GCRbeta-immunoreactive cells in their BAL and peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal control subjects .
Furthermore , GCRbeta expression in GC-insensitive asthma was particularly high in airway T cells , which are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma .
We also examined the expression of GCRbeta in specimens from the airways of patients with chronic bronchitis .
In chronic bronchitis , few cells were GCRbeta-positive and their numbers did not differ significantly from normal control subjects .
We conclude that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with increased expression of GCRbeta in airway T cells .
Programmed cell death is a process required for the normal development of an organism .
One of the best understood apoptotic pathways occurs in T lymphocytes and is mediated by Fas/Fas ligand ( FasL ) interaction .
During studies of apoptosis induced by T cell-receptor engagement , we identified ALG-4F , a truncated transcript that prevents T cell-receptor-induced FasL upregulation and cell death .
Overexpression of full-length ALG-4 induced transcription of FasL and , consequently , apoptosis .
These results indicate that ALG-4 is necessary and sufficient for FasL expression .
Fas/FasL interaction initiates cell death in many other systems , and its dysregulation is a mechanism by which several pathologic conditions arise .
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of FasL regulation could be very useful in elucidating how these diseases develop and in identifying potential therapeutic targets .
Transcription factors USF1 and USF2 up-regulate gene expression ( i.e. , HIV-1 long terminal repeats ) via interaction with an E box on their target promoters , which is also a binding site for c-Myc .
The c-Myc oncoprotein is important in control of cellular proliferation and differentiation , while Yin-Yang 1 ( YY1 ) has been shown to control the expression of a number of cellular and viral genes .
These two proteins physically interact with each other and mutually inhibit their respective biological functions .
In this study , we show that USF/c-Myc up-regulates , while YY1 down-regulates the promoter activity of CXCR4 , a coreceptor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 entry .
We have identified an E box around -260 and a YY1 binding site around -300 relative to the transcription start site .
Mutation of the E box abolished USF/c-Myc- mediated up-regulation of CXCR4 promoter activity , and mutation of the YY1 binding site was associated with unresponsiveness to YY1-mediated inhibition .
These data suggest that USF/c-Myc and YY1 may play an important role in the HIV-1-replicative cycle , by modulating both the viral fusion/entry process and viral expression .
TNF is one of the cytokines secreted by the cells of the immune system .
Our data demonstrate that those cell lines lacking capability to form metastatic tumors in vivo are susceptible to TNF induced apoptosis in vitro .
However , cell lines with high metastatic potential are resistant to TNF in vitro .
Furthermore , the same cell lines were resistant to cytolytic action of other cytotoxic proteins secreted by LAK cells .
Our data showed that TNF resistance in vitro correlates with the increased level of transcription factor NF-kappaB .
This finding may provide a tool to improve current protocols of immunotherapy and insights to how tumor cells are or are not killed by LAK cells .
C5a , a potent peptide chemoattractant , stimulates interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms for C5a-induced IL-8 production , which was 14-fold greater than that in unstimulated cells by 2 hours .
IL-8 secretion was accompanied by accumulation of IL-8 mRNA in the cytosol and by nuclear expression of a kappaB DNA binding activity within 30 minutes .
AP-1 but not NF-IL-6 DNA binding activity was also detected in C5a-stimulated PBMC ; however , its delayed expression ( maximal at 4 hours ) suggested a less important role in the rapid production of IL-8 .
The correlation between C5a-induced kappaB binding activity and IL-8 gene expression was examined in the RAW264.7 macrophage cells using reporter genes directed by the kappaB sequence from IkappaBalpha and IL-8 promoter regions .
C5a-induced reporter gene expression was abolished by introducing mutations into the kappaB sites and by coexpression of a dominant negative IkappaBalpha construct resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation .
Pertussis toxin , which ADP-ribosylates the Gi proteins known to couple to the C5a receptor , produced minimal inhibition of C5a-induced IL-8 expression and had little effect on C5a-induced calcium mobilization in RAW264.7 cells .
These results suggest that NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a-induced IL-8 gene expression and that this response is mediated primarily through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway .
Targeted expression to specific tissues or cell lineages is a necessary feature of a gene therapy vector for many clinical applications , such as correction of hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells .
We developed retroviral vectors in which the constitutive viral enhancer in the U3 region of the 3' LTR is replaced by an autoregulatory enhancer of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene .
The replaced enhancer is propagated to the 5' LTR upon integration into the target cell genome .
The modified vectors were used to transduce human hematopoietic cell lines , cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells , and murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells .
The expression of appropriate reporter genes ( triangle upLNGFR , EGFP ) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of transduced stem cells in vitro , in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay , and in vivo , after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice .
The GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer effectively restricts the expression of the LTR-driven proviral transcription unit to the erythroblastic progeny of both human progenitors and mouse-repopulating stem cells .
Packaging of viral particles , integration into the target genome , and stability of the integrated provirus are not affected by the LTR modification .
Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a retroviral transgene to a specific progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .
Infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in activation of the cell cycle and cell growth .
To interpret the mechanisms by which EBV activates the cell , we have assayed many proteins involved in control of the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle and regulation of apoptosis .
In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of cyclin D2 , are dependent on expression of EBV genes , but an alteration in the E2F-4 profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , presumably occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , CD21 .
By comparing the expression of genes controlling apoptosis , including those encoding several members of the BCL-2 family of proteins , the known relative resistance of EBV-immortalized B-cell lines to apoptosis induced by low serum was found to correlate with expression of both BCL-2 and A20 .
A20 can be regulated by the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which is known to be activated by the EBV LMP-1 protein .
Quantitative assays demonstrated a direct temporal relationship between LMP-1 protein levels and active NF-kappaB during the time course of infection .
The effect of oestrogens on oestrogen-receptive organs and cells is mediated via intracellular receptors ( ERalpha and ERbeta ) .
Oestrogen receptor gene polymorphisms in the region encoding the N-terminal portion of the protein are reportedly associated with pathological conditions including breast cancer , hypertension , spontaneous abortion and coronary heart disease .
A silent mutation in codon 10 of exon 1 , detected in ER-negative and ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines , in breast tumors and blood DNA from breast cancer patients , has been recognized as a polymorphic site .
In this study we examined , by denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis , the possible presence of a codon 10 polymorphic site in normal oestrogen target organs and cells such as the uterus ( myometrium and endometrium ) , in the placenta and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a benign uterus tumour ( leiomyoma ) .
We have detected ER codon 10 polymorphism in these samples and have compared them to those observed in breast cancer samples .
All tissues and cells studied were homozygous for the wild-type gene , and were heterozygous as well as homozygous for the codon-10-variant type .
These results indicate that the presence of the codon-10-variant type is not a characteristic of breast cancer .
Out current findings suggest that further investigations are warranted to elucidate the possible linkage of ER codon 10 polymorphism to physiological and pathological conditions .
NFAT transcription factors play a central role in initiating T-cell activation through the induction of immediate-early T-cell specific genes including interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
NFAT transcription factors bind to a sequence in the IL-2 enhancer known as the antigen receptor response element 2 ( ARRE-2 ) .
Multiple proteins exhibiting ARRE-2 binding activity have been isolated , including a heterodimer from stimulated T-cell nuclear extracts consisting of Mr = 90 000 ( NF90 ) and Mr = 45 000 ( NF45 ) subunits .
The subunits of this heterodimer have been cloned , and NF90 was found to encode a protein containing two domains that are predicted to form motifs capable of binding to double-stranded RNA .
Using in vitro translated polypeptides , we have demonstrated that NF90 specifically binds to double-stranded RNA .
Furthermore , NF90 was phosphorylated in a double-stranded RNA-dependent manner likely by the interferon-induced , double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase , PKR .
The NF90 protein was found to be expressed not only in T-cells , but also in nonimmune HeLa cells .
In HeLa cells , the protein was almost exclusively localized to the ribosome salt wash fraction of cell lysates .
Initiation of DNA replication requires the function of MCM gene products , which participate in ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once in the cell cycle .
Expression of all mammalian genes of the MCM family is induced by growth stimulation , unlike yeast , and the mRNA levels peak at G1/S boundary .
In this study , we examined the transcriptional activities of isolated human MCM gene promoters .
Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters with mutation in the E2F sites failed in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous E2F expression .
In addition , we identified a novel E2F-like sequence in human MCM6 promoter which cooperates with the authentic E2F sites in E2F-dependent regulation .
Forced expression of E2F1 could induce expression of all members of the endogenous MCM genes in rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells .
Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes , and presumably other MCM members , is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to multiple E2F sites in the promoters .
The contact of natural killer ( NK ) cells with foreign cells and with certain virus-infected or tumor cells triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells .
This triggering leads to exocytosis of the cytotoxic NK cell granules .
The oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are not well understood .
In a model where foreign cells ( rat fibroblasts ) were cocultured with human IL-2 activated NK cells , we observed that NK cells were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene c-Myc or E1A .
Both the parental and the oncogene expressing fibroblasts similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells , demonstrating that NK cells were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts .
The cell death was independent of wild-type p53 and was not inhibited by an anti-apoptotic protein EIB19K .
These results provided evidence that c-Myc and E1A activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction .
In consistence , the c-Myc and E1A overexpressing fibroblasts were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than parental cells .
The data indicate that oncogenes activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules .
This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of NK cells towards the virus-infected and cancer cells .
Enforced expression of Id3 , which has the capacity to inhibit many basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors , in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells that have not undergone T cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangements inhibits development of the transduced cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .
Here we document that overexpression of Id3 , in progenitors that have initiated TCR gene rearrangements ( pre-T cells ) , inhibits development into TCRalpha beta but not into TCRgamma delta T cells .
Furthermore , Id3 impedes expression of recombination activating genes and downregulates pre-Talpha mRNA .
These observations suggest possible mechanisms by which Id3 overexpression can differentially affect development of pre-T cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells .
We also observed that cell surface CD4(-)CD8(-)CD3(-) cells with rearranged TCR genes developed from Id3-transduced but not from control-transduced pre-T cells in an FTOC .
These cells had properties of both natural killer ( NK ) and pre-T cells .
These findings suggest that bHLH factors are required to control T cell development after the T/NK developmental checkpoint .
Jagged1 belongs to the DSL family of ligands for Notch receptors that control the proliferation and differentiation of various cell lineages .
However , little is known about the transcription factors that regulate its expression .
Here , we show that Jagged1 is a Rel/NF-kappaB-responsive gene .
Both c-Rel and RelA induced jagged1 gene expression , whereas a mutant defective for transactivation did not .
Importantly , jagged1 transcripts were also upregulated by endogenous NF-kappaB activation and this effect was inhibited by a dominant mutant of IkappaBalpha , a physiological inhibitor of NF-kappaB .
Cell surface expression of Jagged1 in c-Rel-expressing cell monolayers led to a functional interaction with lymphocytes expressing the Notch1/TAN-1 receptor .
This correlated with the initiation of signaling downstream of Notch , as evidenced by increased levels of HES-1 transcripts in co-cultivated T cells and of CD23 transcripts in co-cultivated B cells .
Consistent with its Rel/NF-kappaB-dependent induction , Jagged1 was found to be highly expressed in splenic B cells where c-Rel is expressed constitutively .
These results demonstrate that c-Rel can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells by inducing jagged1 gene expression , and suggest a role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation , differentiation or function .
These findings also highlight the potential for an interplay between the Notch and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in the immune system .
In response to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway , beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus , where it cooperates with LEF/TCF ( for lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor ) transcription factors to activate gene expression .
The mechanisms by which beta-catenin undergoes this shift in location and participates in activation of gene transcription are unknown .
We demonstrate here that beta-catenin can be imported into the nucleus independently of LEF/TCF binding , and it may also be exported from nuclei .
We have introduced a small deletion within beta-catenin ( Delta19 ) that disrupts binding to LEF-1 , E-cadherin , and APC but not axin .
This Delta19 beta-catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm .
The nuclear localization of Delta19 definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which beta-catenin localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of LEF/TCF factors .
beta-Catenin and LEF-1 complexes can activate reporter gene expression in a transformed T-lymphocyte cell line ( Jurkat ) but not in normal T lymphocytes , even though both factors are nuclear .
Thus , localization of both factors to the nucleus is not sufficient for activation of gene expression .
Excess beta-catenin can squelch reporter gene activation by LEF-1-beta-catenin complexes but not activation by the transcription factor VP16 .
Taken together , these data suggest that a third component is necessary for gene activation and that this third component may vary with cell type .
The cytokine pattern on viral antigen recognition is believed to exert a profound influence on the resolution of viral infections and viral clearance .
This study was initiated to investigate whether a cytokine imbalance oriented toward Th2 type response plays a role in chronic hepatitis B .
Cytokine profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with chronic hepatitis B were analysed by RT-PCR .
Upon HBsAg stimulation , expression of IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-10 was detected in 41 % , 8 % , 41 % , and 50 % of the patients , respectively .
Among these cytokines , the expression of IFN-gamma was associated with high levels of serum AST/ALT .
However , we could not prove that Th2 type cytokines had a protective effect on hepatocytes .
Upon HBxAg stimulation , there was no recognizable association of cytokine patterns with AST/ALT levels .
In conclusion , production of a Th1 cytokine , IFN-gamma , by HBsAg-reactive cells was associated with hepatocyte damage in chronic hepatitis B , while no counteracting effect of Th2 cytokines produced by those cells was observed .
The lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 is required for differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells .
We have localized a 317 base pair cis-acting regulatory element , HS I , associated with a hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive site , which lies approx. 3.7 kilobases upstream of the murine hematopoietic-specific GATA-1 IE promoter .
HS I directs high-level expression of reporter GATA-1/lacZ genes to primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in transgenic mice .
Comparative sequence analysis of HS I between human and mouse shows approx. 63 % nucleotide identity with a more conserved core of 169 base pairs ( 86 % identity ) .
This core contains a GATA site separated by 10 base pairs from an E-box motif .
The composite motif binds a multi-protein hematopoietic-specific transcription factor complex which includes GATA-1 , SCL/tal-1 , E2A , Lmo2 and Ldb-1 .
Point mutations of the GATA site abolishes HS I function , whereas mutation of the E-box motif still allows reporter gene expression in both lineages .
Strict dependence of HS I activity on a GATA site implies that assembly of a protein complex containing a GATA-factor , presumably GATA-1 or GATA-2 , is critical to activating or maintaining its function .
Further dissection of the 317 base pair region demonstrates that , whereas all 317 base pairs are required for expression in megakaryocytes , only the 5' 62 base pairs are needed for erythroid-specific reporter expression .
These findings demonstrate differential lineage requirements for expression within the HS I element .
Mobilization of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activates transcription of genes encoding endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines that contribute to monocyte infiltration critical in atherogenesis .
Inhibition of NF-kappaB has been achieved by pharmacological and genetic approaches ; however , monocyte interactions with activated endothelium in shear flow following gene transfer of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha have not been studied .
We found that overexpression of IkappaB-alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) and growth-related activity-alpha ( GRO-alpha ) by TNF-alpha .
This was associated with a reduction in endothelial MCP-1 secretion and GRO-alpha immobilization .
Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha-activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression .
Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .
In contrast , rolling of monocytes was increased by IkappaB-alpha transfer and was partly mediated by P-selectin ; however , it appeared to be unaffected by the inhibition of E-selectin induction .
Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF-kappaB by adenoviral transfer of IkappaB-alpha impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques .
We found that erythropoietin ( EPO ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) activated protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) in EPO-dependent HCD57 erythroid cells .
To better understand signals controlling proliferation and viability , erythroid cells that resist apoptosis in the absence of EPO were subcloned and characterized ( HCD57-SREI cells ) .
Constitutive activations of PKB/Akt , STAT5a , and STAT5b were noted in these EPO-independent cells .
PI3-kinase activity was an upstream activator of PKB/Akt because the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked both constitutive PKB/Akt and factor-dependent PKB/Akt activity .
The LY294002 study showed that proliferation and viability of both HCD57-SREI and HCD57 cells correlated with the activity of PKB/Akt ; however , PKB/Akt activity alone did not protect these cells from apoptosis .
Treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF also activated PKB/Akt , but did not protect from apoptosis .
This result suggested that PKB/PI3-kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient to promote viability and/or proliferation .
Constitutive STAT5 activity , activated through an unknown pathway not including JAK2 or EPOR , may act in concert with the constitutive PI3-kinase/PKB/Akt pathway to protect the EPO-independent HCD57-SREI cells from apoptosis and promote limited proliferation .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax transforms normal T-cells in the presence of interleukin ( IL ) -2 in vitro .
STAT is a family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells .
We investigated the involvement of STATs in the transformation of T-cells by HTLV-1 .
HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed higher amounts of STAT1 , STAT3 and STAT5 RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells .
The expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax .
IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT5 of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation .
In contrast , IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STAT5 .
The expression of STAT1 , STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Our results suggest that the induction of STAT1 and STAT5 by Tax enhances cytokine-induced functions of virus-infected T-cells , hence the induction may play a role in IL-2-dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1 .
The pathways leading to activation in lamina propria ( LP ) T cells are different from peripheral T cells .
LP T cells exhibit enhanced IL-2 secretion when activated through the CD2 pathway .
Coligation of CD28 leads to synergistic enhancement of IL-2 secretion .
Previous studies have characterized the CD28 augmentation of TCR-mediated signaling in peripheral blood T cells through transcriptional activation of an IL-2 promoter CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) , along with enhanced mRNA stability .
This study characterized molecular events involved in CD28 costimulation of IL-2 production in LP mononuclear cells ( LPMC ) .
LPMC exhibited increased IL-2 production in response to CD28 costimulation , compared with cells activated through CD2 alone .
IL-2 secretion was paralleled by increased expression of IL-2 mRNA , resulting from enhanced IL-2 mRNA stability .
In contrast to transcriptional activation in PBMC , EMSA revealed that CD28 coligation of CD2-activated LPMC does not result in increased binding of trans-factors to the CD28RE , nor did Western blots detect changes in I-kappaBalpha or I-kappaBbeta levels following CD28 coligation .
Furthermore , CD28 coligation fails to enhance IL-2 promoter-reporter or RE/AP construct expression in CD2-activated LPMC .
The results reported herein indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in CD28 cosignaling and regulation of IL-2 secretion in LP T cells are unique to that compartment and differ from those seen in peripheral blood T cells .
These observations suggest a biological significance for different mechanisms of IL-2 activation in initiation and maintenance of the cytokine repertoire found in the mucosa .
BACKGROUND : Patients with anorexia nervosa do not display cushingoid features in spite of elevated cortisol plasma levels .
Whether a cortisol resistance or a reduced availability of the metabolic substrates necessary to develop the effect of glucocorticoids is responsible for this has not been established .
METHODS : Twenty-two patients with severe restrictive anorexia nervosa , 10 patients with active Cushing 's disease , and 24 healthy volunteers without psychiatric disorders or mood alterations were investigated .
Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics were examined on mononuclear leukocytes by measuring [3H]dexamethasone binding and the effect of dexamethasone on [3H]thymidine incorporation , which represents an index of DNA synthesis .
RESULTS : The number of glucocorticoid receptors on mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) was comparable in patients with anorexia nervosa , patients with active Cushing 's disease , and normal subjects ( binding capacity 3.3 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.30 and 3.5 +/- 0.20 fmol/10(6) cells ) .
Conversely , glucocorticoid receptor affinity was significantly decreased in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( dissociation constant 4.0 +/- 0.31 and 4.1 +/- 0.34 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.29 nmol/L , p < .001 ) and inversely correlated with the levels of urinary free cortisol in both groups of patients .
Basal [3H]thymidine incorporation in MNL was significantly reduced in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( p < .001 ) and was diminished by dexamethasone to an extent similar to control subjects in patients with anorexia nervosa , but significantly ( p < .001 ) less in those with Cushing 's disease .
In patients with anorexia nervosa , the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the MNL was inversely correlated with urinary free cortisol levels .
CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that the lack of cushingoid features in patients with anorexia nervosa is not ascribable to a reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids but is more likely due to the paucity of metabolic substrates .
Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors .
This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type .
Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors .
Consistent with these findings , Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone deacetylases .
Based on these and our recent findings of associations between Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC , we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone deacetylase complexes to specific promoters .
We had previously shown that the drug undecylprodigiosin ( UP ) blocks human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro .
We have now investigated the mechanism of action of a new analogue of UP , PNU156804 , which shows a more favorable activity profile than UP in mice .
We demonstrate here that the biological effect of PNU156804 in vitro is indistinguishable from UP : PNU156804 blocks human T cell proliferation in mid-late G1 , as determined by cell cycle analysis , expression of cyclins , and cyclin-dependent kinases and retinoblastoma phosphorylation .
In addition , we show that PNU156804 does not block significantly the induction of either IL-2 or IL-2R alpha- and gamma-chains but inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation .
We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by IL-2 in T cells .
We show that PNU156804 does not inhibit c-myc and bcl-2 mRNA induction .
On the other hand , PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the activation of the NF-kappa B and AP-1 transcription factors .
PNU156804 inhibition of NF-kappa B activation is due to the inhibition of the degradation of I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B-beta .
PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways ; it does not affect NF-kappa B activation by PMA in T cells but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes .
We conclude that the prodigiosin family of immunosuppressants is a new family of molecules that show a novel target specificity clearly distinct from that of other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A , FK506 , and rapamycin .
IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive CD4+ cells to Th1 cells ; however , relatively few IL-12 target genes have been identified .
To better clarify the molecular basis of IL-12 action , we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by IL-12 , first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-alpha-inducible genes .
We identified several genes up-regulated by IL-12 , namely , MIP-1alpha , MIP-1beta , IL-1RA , and IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) .
IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses .
We demonstrated that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-alpha in normal human T cells and in NK cells .
We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1 , an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production .
Furthermore , IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1 , whereas IFN-alpha and IL-12 did not .
The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways .
First , STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct , and second , STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA .
In contrast to IL-12 , no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells , and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 .
Therefore , IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12 signaling , and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/- mice might be attributable , in part , to the absence of this transcription factor .
The transcription factor NF-ATc that controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and embryonic cardiac cells is expressed in three prominent isoforms .
This is due to alternative splice/polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in naive T cells and a shorter NF-ATc isoform in effector T cells .
Whereas the previously described isoform NF-ATc/A contains a relatively short C terminus , the longer isoforms , B and C , span extra C-terminal peptides of 128 and 246 aa , respectively .
We show here that in addition to the strong N-terminal trans-activation domain , TAD-A , which is common to all three NF-ATc isoforms , NF-ATc/C contains a second trans-activation domain , TAD-B , in its C-terminal peptide .
Various stimuli of T cells that induce the activity of TAD-A also enhance the activity of TAD-B , but , unlike TAD-A , TAD-B remains unphosphorylated by protein from 12-O-tetradecanoyl 12-phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated T cells .
The shorter C-terminal peptide of isoform NF-ATc/B exerts a suppressive transcriptional effect .
These properties of NF-ATc/B and - C might be of importance for gene regulation in naive T lymphocytes in which NF-ATc/B and -C are predominantly synthesized .
The secondary lymphoid tissues are located at strategic sites where foreign antigens can be efficiently brought together with immune system regulatory and effector cells .
The organized structure of the secondary lymphoid tissues is thought to enhance the sensitivity of antigen recognition and to support proper regulation of the activation and maturation of the antigen-responsive lymphoid cells .
Although a substantial amount is known about the cellular elements that compose the lymphoid and nonlymphoid components of the secondary lymphoid tissues , information concerning the signals that control the development of the tissues and that maintain the organized tissue microenvironment remain undefined .
Studies over the past few years have identified lymphotoxin as a critical signaling molecule not only for the organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues but for the maintenance of aspects of their microarchitecture as well .
Additional signaling molecules that contribute to the formation of normal lymphoid tissue structure are being identified at an accelerating pace .
Analyses of mouse strains with congenital defects in different aspects of secondary lymphoid tissue development are beginning to clarify the role of these tissues in immune responses and host defense .
This review focuses on studies defining recently identified crucial signals for the biogenesis of secondary lymphoid organs and for the maintenance of their proper microarchitecture .
It also discusses new insights into how the structure of these tissues supports effective immune responses .
BACKGROUND : Polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) associated with diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) are found in the atmospheric urban pollution .
Such compounds have been shown to favor IgE production , bronchial hyperresponsiveness , and airway inflammation .
Chemokines are a group of chemotactic cytokines involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells .
OBJECTIVE : We investigated the effect of DEP-PAHs on the release and mRNA expression of IL-8 , MCP-1 , and RANTES by PBMCs obtained from healthy subjects .
METHODS : Protein production in supernatants was assessed by ELISA , and mRNA expression was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR .
RESULTS : Secretion of IL-8 and RANTES increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of DEP-PAHs ( range , 0.5 ng to 50 ng/mL ) .
On the contrary , the release of MCP-1 was significantly inhibited , also in a dose-dependent manner .
Messenger RNA production coding for IL-8 , RANTES , and MCP-1 showed parallel variations to the production of the correspondent proteins .
Effects of DEP-PAHs became significant at 7 hours and up to 48 hours time culture for MCP-1 , and up to 24 hours time culture for IL-8 and RANTES .
Moreover , supernatants from DEP-PAH-activated cells , compared with those of controls , exhibited a significantly enhanced chemotactic activity for neutrophils and eosinophils , which was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with anti-IL-8 and anti-RANTES neutralizing antibodies , respectively .
CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that the chemokine pathways are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level , reinforcing the idea that the development of inflammatory reactions might be affected by diesel exhaust emission .
Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood .
PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages .
PU.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice .
Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells requires a decline in the level of PU.1 , indicating that PU.1 can block erythroid differentiation .
Here we investigate the mechanism by which PU.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation .
We find that PU.1 interacts directly with GATA-1 , a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation .
Interaction between PU.1 and GATA-1 requires intact DNA-binding domains in both proteins .
PU.1 represses GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation .
Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of PU.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in MEL cells .
We also show that ectopic expression of PU.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development .
Furthermore , introduction of exogenous GATA-1 in both MEL cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by PU.1 .
Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation .
Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell , the blood monocyte ( monocyte ) , the reason ( s ) for these functional changes have not been determined .
We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity ( Monick , M. M. , Carter , A. B. , Gudmundsson , G. , Geist , L. J. , and Hunninghake , G. W. ( 1998 ) Am. J. Physiol. 275 , L389-L397 ) .
To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity , we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex .
There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein , REF-1 ( which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins ) , in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
In addition , in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1 .
Finally , addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding .
These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity .
This observation may explain , in part , some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
Genetic variation in cytokine promoter regions is postulated to influence susceptibility to infection , but the molecular mechanisms by which such polymorphisms might affect gene regulation are unknown .
Through systematic DNA footprinting of the TNF ( encoding tumour necrosis factor , TNF ) promoter region , we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) that causes the helix-turn-helix transcription factor OCT-1 to bind to a novel region of complex protein-DNA interactions and alters gene expression in human monocytes .
The OCT-1-binding genotype , found in approximately 5 % of Africans , is associated with fourfold increased susceptibility to cerebral malaria in large case-control studies of West African and East African populations , after correction for other known TNF polymorphisms and linked HLA alleles .
Interleukin ( IL ) -4 plays an important role in IgE synthesis in B cells and in Th2 differentiation in T cells .
IL-4 conducts its biological activities through binding to the IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) on the surface of target cells .
IL-4R are thought to be composed of the IL-4R alpha chain ( IL-4R alpha ) and either the IL-2R gamma chain or the IL-13R alpha chain .
We have previously shown that the membrane-proximal portion in the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-4R alpha ( hIL-4R alpha ) is critical for proliferation , generation of germline epsilon transcript , and activation of STAT6 , based on analyses of truncated hIL-4R alphas .
In this study , we found that p47phox , an activator of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase , binds to this portion by the two-hybrid system .
Furthermore , we observed the association of p47phox with the hIL-4R alpha in B cells derived from a normal donor .
These results suggest that p47phox is involved in the signal transduction of IL-4 in B cells .
However , activation of STAT6 , CD23 expression , and IgE synthesis induced by IL-4 were not affected in p47phox-deficient patients , which raises the possibility that p47phox may be important in other signaling activities as well in B cells .
We searched for proteins that interact with Ras in interleukin ( IL ) -2-stimulated or IL-2-deprived cells , and found that the transcription factor Aiolos interacts with Ras .
The Ras-Aiolos interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation .
Indirect immunofluorescence shows that IL-2 controls the cellular distribution of Aiolos and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation , required for dissociation from Ras .
We also identified functional Aiolos-binding sites in the Bcl-2 promoter , which are able to activate the luciferase reporter gene .
Mutation of Aiolos-binding sites within the Bcl-2 promoter inhibits transactivation of the reporter gene luciferase , suggesting direct control of Bcl-2 expression by Aiolos .
Co-transfection experiments confirm that Aiolos induces Bcl-2 expression and prevents apoptosis in IL-2-deprived cells .
We propose a model for the regulation of Bcl-2 expression via Aiolos .
Rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue was examined and compared with osteoarthritis tissue for the presence of the nuclear transcription factor C/EBP beta ( NF-IL-6 ) .
The region ( lining or sublining ) , cell type , and subcellular distribution ( cytoplasmic or nuclear ) of the expression of C/EBP beta was characterized .
Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid and blood and normal peripheral blood were also examined .
C/EBP beta was detected in the synovial lining and in sublining cells of synovial tissue from patients with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis .
A significant ( P < 0.001 and < 0.05 , respectively ) increase in the percentage of cells with nuclear staining was seen in the lining layer , compared to cells in the sublining region , in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis .
In both diseases a strong correlation ( r = 0.79 , P < 0.001 ) was observed between the percentage of cells in the synovial lining that were positive for nuclear C/EBP beta and lining cell depth .
Two-color immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes were positive for nuclear C/EBP beta .
The presence of C/EBP beta was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with isolated synovial fibroblasts .
Nuclear C/EBP beta was also detected in rheumatoid synovial fluid monocytes/macrophages , but not in lymphocytes or neutrophils .
Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of C/EBP beta in these cells .
The intensity of C/EBP beta staining was greater ( P < 0.001 ) in synovial fluid monocytes than in those from normal or rheumatoid peripheral blood .
In conclusion , the enhanced nuclear staining for C/EBP beta in the synovial lining , compared to the sublining , suggesting activation in the lining , and the positive correlation of lining layer depth with the percentage of cells in the lining positive for nuclear C/EBP beta , suggest a potential role for C/EBP beta in chronic inflammation .
The regulation of the production or activity of C/EBP beta , to inhibit inflammatory mediator expression by synovial macrophages and fibroblasts , offers a novel approach to therapeutic intervention .
Looking back at successes and failures in newer approaches to treating IBD , it is tempting -- although still difficult -- to draw conclusions about pathogenesis .
When a therapy proves effective , do clinicians truly know how it works ?
Even with a therapy as specific as anti-TNF antibody , it is not clear if the benefit is attributable to simple binding and clearance of TNF-alpha or to binding on the cell surface and subsequent deletion of the activated macrophage .
When a drug appears to be less effective than preclinical models suggest , can failures in effectiveness from delivery or dosing be differentiated ?
The disappointing results of clinical trials with IL-10 -- so at odds with the prediction of benefit from animal models -- bring into question the validity of those models as well as the soundness of design of the clinical trials on which efficacy of IL-10 is judged .
The variability of response even to the most narrowly targeted agents suggests that these diseases are far more heterogeneous in humans than in their murine counterparts .
Clinicians are only just beginning to recognize subclinical markers of response , and it may soon be possible to predict response on the basis of genetic composition .
For the moment , however , the field of pharmacogenetics is embryonic .
Challenges in developing new therapeutic strategies include not only identifying novel agents , but also improving the definitions of clinical endpoints and defining efficacy at the biologic level .
Only through considered evaluation of clinical evidence may clinicians determine which therapies should remain novelties and which should become an accepted part of the armamentarium .
In T lymphocytes , the hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) uses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) -induced signaling pathways to regulate E2F transcriptional activity , a critical cell cycle checkpoint .
PI 3-kinase also regulates the activity of p70(s6k) , the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase , a response that is abrogated by the macrolide rapamycin .
This immunosuppressive drug is known to prevent T-cell proliferation , but the precise point at which rapamycin regulates T-cell cycle progression has yet to be elucidated .
Moreover , the effects of rapamycin on , and the role of p70(s6k) in , IL-2 and PI 3-kinase activation of E2Fs have not been characterized .
Our present results show that IL-2- and PI 3-kinase-induced pathways for the regulation of E2F transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components .
Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70(s6k) in T cells could restore rapamycin-suppressed E2F responses .
Thus , the rapamycin-controlled processes involved in E2F regulation appear to be mediated by p70(s6k) .
However , the rapamycin-resistant p70(s6k) could not rescue rapamycin inhibition of T-cell cycle entry , consistent with the involvement of additional , rapamycin-sensitive pathways in the control of T-cell cycle progression .
The present results thus show that p70(s6k) is able to regulate E2F transcriptional activity and provide direct evidence for the first time for a link between IL-2 receptors , PI 3-kinase , and p70(s6k) that regulates a crucial G1 checkpoint in T lymphocytes .
Members of the recently discovered SOCS/CIS/SSI family have been proposed as regulators of cytokine signaling , and while targets and mechanisms have been suggested for some family members , the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined .
To date no SOCS proteins have been specifically implicated in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) signaling in T cells .
Here we report SOCS-3 expression in response to IL-2 in both T-cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
SOCS-3 protein was detectable as early as 30 min following IL-2 stimulation , while CIS was seen only at low levels after 2 h .
Unlike CIS , SOCS-3 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was observed upon coexpression with Jak1 and Jak2 but only weakly with Jak3 .
In these experiments , SOCS-3 associated with Jak1 and inhibited Jak1 phosphorylation , and this inhibition was markedly enhanced by the presence of IL-2 receptor beta chain ( IL-2Rbeta ) .
Moreover , following IL-2 stimulation of T cells , SOCS-3 was able to interact with the IL-2 receptor complex , and in particular tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 and IL-2Rbeta .
Additionally , in lymphocytes expressing SOCS-3 but not CIS , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b was markedly reduced , while there was only a weak effect on IL-3-mediated STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation .
Finally , proliferation induced by both IL-2- and IL-3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of SOCS-3 .
The findings suggest that when SOCS-3 is rapidly induced by IL-2 in T cells , it acts to inhibit IL-2 responses in a classical negative feedback loop .
The expression of the PML gene was investigated in purified early hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation .
PML mRNA and protein , while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs , are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage .
Thereafter , PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation , whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway .
In functional studies , PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA ( alpha-PML ) .
Interestingly , early treatment ( day 0 HPCs ) with alpha-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies , whereas late treatment ( day 5 culture ) reduced erythroid , but not granulocytic , clonogenesis .
These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid , but not granulocytic maturation .
The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105 .
Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development .
Furthermore , PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis .
These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis : the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105 .
BACKGROUND : Adhesion molecule expression on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface is critical for leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions .
Better understanding of transcriptional regulation of adhesion molecules in ECs may provide important insight into plaque formation .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( PPARalpha ) , a member of the nuclear receptor family , regulates gene expression in response to certain fatty acids and fibric acid derivatives .
The present study investigated PPARalpha expression in human ECs and their regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry revealed that human carotid artery ECs express PPARalpha .
Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARalpha activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner , an effect not seen with PPARgamma activators .
Both PPARalpha activators decreased cytokine-induced VCAM-1 mRNA expression without altering its mRNA half-life .
Transient transfection of deletional VCAM-1 promoter constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that fenofibrate inhibits VCAM-1 transcription in part by inhibiting NF-kappaB .
Finally , PPARalpha activators significantly reduced adhesion of U937 cells to cultured human ECs .
CONCLUSIONS : Human ECs express PPARalpha , a potentially important regulator of atherogenesis through its transcriptional control of VCAM-1 gene expression .
Such findings also have implications regarding the clinical use of lipid-lowering agents , like fibric acids , which can activate PPARalpha .
The Wilms ' tumor gene ( WT1 ) encodes a transcription factor of the zinc finger type .
A high expression of WT1 has been detected in a range of acute leukemias , and WT1 is downregulated during induced differentiation of some leukemic cell lines .
Overexpression of WT1 in some myeloid cell lines confers resistance to differentiation induction .
These observations suggest that a high WT1 expression in hematopoietic cells is incompatible with differentiation .
In this study , each of the four different isoforms of WT1 was constitutively overexpressed in the leukemic cell line K562 .
K562 cells express endogenous WT1 , which is downregulated as a response to induced differentiation along the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways .
We now demonstrate that a forced exogenous expression of the four different isoforms of WT1 in K562 does not affect the differentiation response , as judged by accumulation of hemoglobin in response to hemin or the expression of megakaryocytic cell surface markers in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
We conclude that downregulation of WT1 during induced differentiation of K562 cells is not a prerequisite for erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation of these cells .
Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase required for T cell development and activated by cytokines that utilize the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor common gamma chain ( gamma(c) ) .
Genetic inactivation of JAK3 is manifested as severe combined immunodeficiency disease ( SCID ) in humans and mice .
These findings have suggested that JAK3 represents a pharmacological target to control certain lymphoid-derived diseases .
Here we provide novel evidence that AG-490 potently inhibits the autokinase activity of JAK3 and tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a and 5b ( STAT5a/b ) .
Similar inhibitory effects were observed with other cytokines that use gamma(c) .
AG-490 also inhibited IL-2-mediated proliferative growth in human T cells with an IC50) = 25 microM that was partially recoverable .
Moreover , we demonstrate that this inhibitor prevented tetanus toxoid antigen-specific T cell proliferation and expansion but failed to block activation of Zap70 or p56Lck after anti-CD3 stimulation of human T cells .
Taken together , these findings suggest that AG-490 inhibits the JAK3-mediated Type II signaling pathway but not the T cell receptor-derived Type I pathway and possesses therapeutic potential for T cell-derived pathologies such as graft-versus-host disease , allergy , and autoimmune disorders .
Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and its receptor ( EPOR ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes .
After binding of ligand , the EPOR activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression .
Although erythroid progenitors appear to be the principal EPO-responsive cell type in vivo due to the restricted expression of the EPOR , many growth factor-dependent cell lines expressing the EPOR can respond to EPO by activating many or all of these pathways .
In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] -dependent HT-2 line ) in which the EPO stimulation of the EPOR fails to support cellular proliferation , STAT-5 induction , or MAPK activation , despite efficient phosphorylation of the EPOR and JAK2 and inhibition of apoptosis after withdrawal of IL-2 .
Interestingly , when we fused HT-2 cells expressing the EPOR with Ba/F3 cells in a complementation assay , the resulting hybridomas proliferated and potently activated STAT-5 and MAPK in response to EPO .
These data indicate that an unidentified cellular factor is needed to mediate signaling by the EPOR .
Moreover , Ba/F3 cells apparently express this factor ( s ) and somatic fusions can , therefore , confer EPO-responsiveness to HT-2 cells that lack this factor .
Recently NF-kappaB has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions .
In T cell hybridomas , both T cell activators and glucocorticoids induce apoptosis .
Here we show that blockade of NF-kappaB activity , using a dominant negative IkappaBalpha , has opposite effects on these two apoptotic signals .
Treatment with PMA plus ionomycin ( P/I ) results in the upregulation of Fas Ligand ( FasL ) and induction of apoptosis .
Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity inhibits the P/I mediated induction of FasL mRNA and decreases the level of apoptosis in these cultures , thus establishing NF-kappaB as a proapoptotic factor in this context .
Conversely , inhibition of NF-kappaB confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis , establishing that NF-kappaB also functions as an antiapoptotic factor .
We conclude that NF-kappaB is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator .
Our data suggests that NF-kappaB may function as an antiapoptotic factor in thymocytes while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in mature peripheral T cells .
The chronic immune response in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) might be driven by activated Th1 cells without sufficient Th2 cell differentiation to down-modulate inflammation .
To test whether disordered memory T cell differentiation contributes to the typical Th1-dominated chronic inflammation in RA we investigated differentiation of resting CD4+ memory T cells in patients with early ( 6 wk to 12 mo ) untreated RA and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls in vitro .
No difference in cytokine secretion profiles of freshly isolated memory T cells was detected between patients and controls .
A cell culture system was then employed that permitted the differentiation of Th effectors from resting memory T cells by short term priming .
Marked differences were found in response to priming .
Th2 cells could be induced in all healthy controls by priming with anti-CD28 in the absence of TCR ligation .
By contrast , priming under those conditions resulted in Th2 differentiation in only 9 of 24 RA patients .
Exogenous IL-4 could overcome the apparent Th2 differentiation defect in seven patients but was without effect in the remaining eight patients .
In all patients a marked decrease in IL-2-producing cells and a significant increase in well-differentiated Th1 cells that produced IFN-gamma but not IL-2 were evident after priming with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 .
The data suggest that CD4+ memory T cells from patients with early untreated RA manifest an intrinsic abnormality in their ability to differentiate into specific cytokine-producing effector cells that might contribute to the characteristic Th1-dominated chronic ( auto ) immune inflammation in RA .
Human Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) is a signaling receptor that responds to LPS and activates NF-kappaB .
Here , we investigate further the events triggered by TLR2 in response to LPS .
We show that TLR2 associates with the high-affinity LPS binding protein membrane CD14 to serve as an LPS receptor complex , and that LPS treatment enhances the oligomerization of TLR2 .
Concomitant with receptor oligomerization , the IL-1R-associated kinase ( IRAK ) is recruited to the TLR2 complex .
Intracellular deletion variants of TLR2 lacking C-terminal 13 or 141 aa fail to recruit IRAK , which is consistent with the inability of these mutants to transmit LPS cellular signaling .
Moreover , both deletion mutants could still form complexes with wild-type TLR2 and act in a dominant-negative ( DN ) fashion to block TLR2-mediated signal transduction .
DN constructs of myeloid differentiation protein , IRAK , TNF receptor-associated factor 6 , and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , when coexpressed with TLR2 , abrogate TLR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation .
These results reveal a conserved signaling pathway for TLR2 and IL-1Rs and suggest a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of TLR2 by DN variants .
T lymphocytes from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) show reduced immune function and impaired activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappaB .
We determined the mechanism of NF-kappaB suppression in T cells of RCC patient and determined whether supernatant fluid from RCC explants ( RCC-S ) induced the same phenotype of NF-kappaB suppression in normal T cells that is observed in patient T cells .
The pattern of kappaB-binding activity in T cells of RCC patient was altered as compared to that seen in T cells obtained from normal volunteers .
In some patients , no activation of RelA/NFkappaB1-binding activity was detectable , while in others kappaB-binding activity was modestly induced but the duration was reduced .
IkappaBalpha was degraded normally following stimulation in both normal controls and T cells from RCC patients .
RCC-S did not alter the cytoplasmic levels of RelA and NF-kappaB1 but did suppress their nuclear localization and inhibited the activation of RelA/NF-kappaB1 binding complexes .
These results show that RCC-S can induce in normal T cells the same phenotype of impaired NF-kappaB activation that is detected in T cells of RCC patient .
It also appears that NF-kappaB suppression by RCC-S may contribute to the immunosuppression of host immunity .
OBJECTIVE : To create monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies ( mAECA ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation .
METHODS : A panel of mAECA was generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with Takayasu arteritis , using Epstein-Barr virus transformation .
Activity against macrovascular EC ( HUVEC ) and microvascular EC ( human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 ) antigens was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Inhibition studies were used to select the monoclonal antibodies ( mAECA ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the total IgG-AECA from the Takayasu arteritis patient .
The binding of the mAECA to human aortic EC was studied by immunohistochemistry .
The secretion levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) were determined , to serve as markers for EC activation .
The activated EC were examined for the adherence of a monocytic cell line ( U937 ) , as well as for expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and E-selectin .
In addition , nuclear extracts of the mAECA-treated EC were analyzed for the induction of translocation of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , using a specific NF-kappaB oligoprobe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
RESULTS : Six mAECA were selected , the mixture of which produced 100 % inhibition of binding of the original IgG ( from the patient with Takayasu arteritis ) to HUVEC .
All mAECA possessed high activity against macrovascular EC , but none had significant antimicrovascular EC activity .
The mAECA , but not normal human IgG , had anti-human aortic EC activity .
Four of the 6 mAECA activated EC , manifested by increased IL-6 and vWF secretion .
The 4 mAECA induced EC expression of adhesion molecules and increased adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to EC .
In addition , these mAECA stimulated the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .
CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that AECA may directly stimulate EC in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of adhesion molecule expression associated with NF-kappaB activation and adhesion of monocytes , and may therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis .
ICSAT ( Interferon Consensus Sequence binding protein for Activated T cells ) is a lymphocyte-specific member of the interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) family of transcription factors , originally identified through Southwestern screening of the ATL ( Adult T-cell leukemia ) -16T expression library .
In this study , we created transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT in lymphocytes .
Although spontaneous tumorigenesis was not observed , IL-2 production with Concanavalin A stimulation was significantly increased in transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT .
ICSAT overexpression in lymphocytes seems insufficient for the leukemogenesis of ATL or multiple myeloma ( MM ) , however , it may regulate T cell activation and its overexpression may lead to leukemogenesis via controlling IL-2 production .

A site in the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) -associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation .
We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from TNFR1 signaling through TRADD .
LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation , while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues .
Further , LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation , while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302 .
LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293 .
Unlike TNFR1 , LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines .
Surprisingly , LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-kappaB activation .
Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP , LMP1 does not induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells .
These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1 , TRADD , and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth .
Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , including surface Ag receptor-initiated signaling events and lymphokine production .
Because NF-kappa B contributes to the transcription of numerous inflammatory genes and has been shown to be a molecular target of antiinflammatory drugs , we sought to characterize the functional role of the NF-kappa B protein complex in lupus T cells .
Freshly isolated T cells from lupus patients , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the TCR with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs to assess proximal membrane signaling , and with PMA and a calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events .
We measured the NF-kappa B binding activity in nuclear extracts by gel shift analysis .
When compared with normal cells , the activation of NF-kappa B activity in SLE patients was significantly decreased in SLE , but not in RA , patients .
NF-kappa B binding activity was absent in several SLE patients who were not receiving any medication , including corticosteroids .
Also , NF-kappa B activity remained absent in follow-up studies .
In supershift experiments using specific Abs , we showed that , in the group of SLE patients who displayed undetectable NF-kappa B activity , p65 complexes were not formed .
Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed decreased or absent p65 protein levels .
As p65 complexes are transcriptionally active in comparison to the p50 homodimer , this novel finding may provide insight on the origin of abnormal cytokine or other gene transcription in SLE patients .
We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of STAT5 activation through the human IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) .
By functionally expressing receptor mutants in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 , we could show that phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the IL-4R alpha chain are dispensable for IL-4-induced STAT5 activity .
However , disruption of a membrane-proximal proline-rich sequence motif ( ' box1 ' ) in either subunit of the bipartite IL-4R abolished not only ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 , but also IL-4-triggered activation of STAT5 and concomitant cell proliferation .
A dominant-negative version of STAT5b , but not of STAT5a , interfered with IL-4-induced DNA synthesis in Ba/F3 cells , suggesting an involvement of STAT5b in the control of cell proliferation through IL-4R .
Reporter gene experiments finally showed that transcription from promoters of STAT5 target genes can be specifically induced by challenging cells with IL-4 , and that both STAT5a and STAT5b can contribute to IL-4-triggered transcriptional control .
We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) to stimulate interleukin ( IL ) -8 production by neutrophils .
MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8 .
Incubation with 2 microM MBP showed that , after a 1 h lag , the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h .
At the 2 microM concentration , eosinophil cationic protein , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , and eosinophil peroxidase did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production .
MBP stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) after 1 and 3 h of incubation , which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D .
However , stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB or activator protein-1 .
No NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts .
In addition , stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA .
MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1alpha and MIP-1beta , but did not stimulate the release of either chemokine .
These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and , further , that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation .
We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases .
The peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors , plays a key role in the anti-diabetic actions of the thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) .
PPARgamma induces the expression of many genes involved in lipid anabolism , including the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein ( aP2 ) , and is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation .
PPARgamma is also expressed in hematopoietic cells and is up-regulated in activated monocytes/macrophages .
Activation of PPARgamma may play a role in the induction of differentiation of macrophages to foam cells that are associated with atherosclerotic lesions .
We report that both natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists induce time- and dose-dependent increases in aP2 mRNA in both primary human monocytes and the monocytic cell line , THP-1 .
These data suggest that PPARgamma activation may play a role in monocyte differentiation and function analogous to its well-characterized role in adipocytes .
The generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , a key signal of the innate immune system .
Yet , for many pathogens , the molecules that induce IL-12 production by macrophages and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined .
Here it is shown that microbial lipoproteins are potent stimulators of IL-12 production by human macrophages , and that induction is mediated by Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) .
Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent transcription of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide , a powerful microbicidal pathway .
Activation of TLRs by microbial lipoproteins may initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious pathogens .
We have isolated the 5' region of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase ( low K ( m ) 5'-NT ) gene and established that a 969- base pair ( bp ) fragment confers cell-specific expression of a CAT reporter gene that correlates with the expression of endogenous ecto-5'-NT mRNA and enzymatic activity .
A 768-bp upstream negative regulatory region has been identified that conferred lymphocyte-specific negative regulation in a heterologous system with a 244-bp deoxycytidine kinase core promoter .
DNase I footprinting identified several protected areas including Sp1 , Sp1/AP-2 , and cAMP response element ( CRE ) binding sites within the 201-bp core promoter region and Sp1 , NRE-2a , TCF-1/LEF-1 , and Sp1/NF-AT binding sites in the upstream regulatory region .
Whereas the CRE site was essential in mediating the negative activity of the upstream regulatory region in Jurkat but not in HeLa cells , mutation of the Sp1/AP-2 site decreased promoter activity in both cell lines .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of proteins binding to the CRE site identified both ATF-1 and ATF-2 in Jurkat cells .
Finally , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the activity of both the core and the 969-bp promoter fragments , and this increase was abrogated by mutations at the CRE site .
In summary , we have identified a tissue-specific regulatory region 5' of the ecto-5'-NT core promoter that requires the presence of a functional CRE site within the basal promoter for its suppressive activity .
Activation of CD40 is essential for thymus-dependent humoral immune responses and rescuing B cells from apoptosis .
Many of the effects of CD40 are believed to be achieved through altered gene expression .
In addition to Bcl-x , a known CD40-regulated antiapoptotic molecule , we identified a related antiapoptotic molecule , A1/Bfl-1 , as a CD40-inducible gene .
Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-kappaB abolished CD40-induced up-regulation of both the Bfl-1 and Bcl-x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas-induced cell death .
Within the upstream promoter region of Bcl-x , a potential NF-kappaB-binding sequence was found to support NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation .
Furthermore , expression of physiological levels of Bcl-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the absence of NF-kappaB signaling .
Thus , our results suggest that CD40-mediated cell survival proceeds through NF-kappaB-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 family members .
cDNA microarrays and a clustering algorithm were used to identify patterns of gene expression in human mammary epithelial cells growing in culture and in primary human breast tumors .
Clusters of coexpressed genes identified through manipulations of mammary epithelial cells in vitro also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor samples .
By using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against proteins encoded by a particular gene in a cluster , the identity of the cell type within the tumor specimen that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be determined .
Clusters of genes with coherent expression patterns in cultured cells and in the breast tumors samples could be related to specific features of biological variation among the samples .
Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with activation of the IFN-regulated signal transduction pathway , respectively .
Clusters of genes expressed by stromal cells and lymphocytes in the breast tumors also were identified in this analysis .
These results support the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach to studying variation in gene expression patterns in human cancers as a means to dissect and classify solid tumors .
Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli , including chemotherapy drugs and glucocorticoids .
It is generally accepted that Bcl-2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimerizing with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bad .
However , the mechanism of the antiapoptotic effects is unclear .
Paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb microtubule dynamics kill cells in a Fas / Fas ligand ( FasL ) -dependent manner ; antibody to FasL inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
We have found that Bcl-2 overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) -induced expression of FasL and blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
The mechanism of this effect is that Bcl-2 prevents the nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes , a transcription factor activated by microtubule damage ) by binding and sequestering calcineurin , a calcium-dependent phosphatase that must dephosphorylate NFAT to move to the nucleus .
Without NFAT nuclear translocation , the FasL gene is not transcribed .
Thus , it appears that paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb microtubule function kill cells at least in part through the induction of FasL .
Furthermore , Bcl-2 antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting calcineurin activation , blocking NFAT nuclear translocation , and preventing FasL expression .
The effects of Bcl-2 can be overcome , at least partially , through phosphorylation of Bcl-2 .
Phosphorylated Bcl-2 can not bind calcineurin , and NFAT activation , FasL expression , and apoptosis can occur after Bcl-2 phosphorylation .
The chimeric gene , AML1/ETO ( MTG8 ) , generated in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of Bcl-2 .
To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis , effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line , 32Dcl3 , were examined .
When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate , the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed .
However , even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2 .
On the contrary , 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF .
These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of AML1/ETO .
Tumor cell lines with a defective retinoblastoma gene are unable to transcribe the HLA class II genes in response to IFN-gamma treatment , and reconstitution of functional Rb rescues IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression .
However , the molecular mechanism of Rb rescue of the class II genes is unknown .
We have examined the effect of Rb expression on the activation of the promoter for HLA-DRA , the prototype class II gene .
Oct-1 , a POU domain transcription factor , was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells .
Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1 , thus relieving its repressive effect .
Oct-1 has also been shown to repress interleukin 8 promoter activity .
Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines , interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines .
The nuclear factor of kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is key in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation .
T cell receptor ( TCR ) cross-linking is in part required for activation of NF-kappaB , which is dependent on the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha .
By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcineurin , results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex but not of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase , p90 ( rsk ) .
We also demonstrate that the IKK complex , but not p90 ( rsk ) , is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin .
Each second messenger is necessary , as inhibition of either one reverses the activation of the IKK complex and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in vivo .
Overexpression of dominant negative forms of IKKalpha and -beta demonstrates that only IKKbeta is the target for PKC and calcineurin .
These results indicate that within the TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway both PKC and calcineurin are required for the effective activation of the IKK complex and NF-kappaB in T lymphocytes .
Eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) is expressed exclusively in eosinophils and basophils in hematopoietic cells .
In our previous study , we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription .
Further analysis of the MBP promoter region identified a C/EBP ( CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ) consensus binding site 6 bp upstream of the functional GATA-binding site in the MBP gene .
In the cell line HT93A , which is capable of differentiating towards both the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages in response to retinoic acid ( RA ) , C/EBPalpha mRNA expression decreased significantly concomitant with eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation , whereas C/EBPbeta expression was markedly increased .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) showed that recombinant C/EBPbeta protein could bind to the potential C/EBP-binding site ( bp -90 to -82 ) in the MBP promoter .
Furthermore , we have demonstrated that both C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can bind simultaneously to the C/EBP- and GATA-binding sites in the MBP promoter .
To determine the functionality of both the C/EBP- and GATA- binding sites , we analyzed whether C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can stimulate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 negative Jurkat T-cell line .
Cotransfection with C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 expression vectors produced a 5-fold increase compared with cotransfection with the C/EBPbeta or GATA-1 expression vectors individually .
In addition , GST pull-down experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between human GATA-1 and C/EBPbeta .
Expression of FOG ( riend ATA ) , which binds to GATA-1 and acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins , decreased transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP promoter in a dose-dependent manner .
Our results provide the first evidence that both GATA-1 and C/EBPbeta synergistically transactivate the promoter of an eosinophil-specific granule protein gene and that FOG may act as a negative cofactor for the eosinophil lineage , unlike its positively regulatory function for the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages .
To investigate regulatory networks in Legionella pneumophila , the gene encoding the homolog of the Escherichia coli stress and stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS was identified by complementation of an E. coli rpoS mutation .
An open reading frame that is approximately 60 % identical to the E. coli rpoS gene was identified .
Western blot analysis showed that the level of L. pneumophila RpoS increased in stationary phase .
An insertion mutation was constructed in the rpoS gene on the chromosome of L. pneumophila , and the ability of this mutant strain to survive various stress conditions was assayed and compared with results for the wild-type strain .
Both the mutant and wild-type strains were more resistant to stress when in stationary phase than when in the logarithmic phase of growth .
This finding indicates that L. pneumophila RpoS is not required for a stationary-phase-dependent resistance to stress .
Although the mutant strain was able to kill HL-60- and THP-1-derived macrophages , it could not replicate within a protozoan host , Acanthamoeba castellanii .
These data suggest that L. pneumophila possesses a growth phase-dependent resistance to stress that is independent of RpoS control and that RpoS likely regulates genes that enable it to survive in the environment within protozoa .
Our data indicate that the role of rpoS in L. pneumophila is very different from what has previously been reported for E. coli rpoS .
Recent data show that TCR/CD3 stimulation induces activation of Stat5 in murine T cells .
Here , we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and Staphylococcal enterotoxin ( SE ) induce a rapid , gradually accumulating , long-lasting tyrosine , and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 ( but not Stat5 ) in allogen-specific human CD4+ T cell lines .
In contrast , IL-2 induces a rapid and transient tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 .
Compared with IL-2 , CD3 ligation induces a delayed Stat3 binding to oligonucleotide probes from the ICAM-1 and IL-2R alpha promoter .
CD3-mediated activation of Stat3 is almost completely inhibited by a Src kinase inhibitor ( PP1 ) , whereas IL-2-induced Stat3 activation is unaffected .
In conclusion , we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and SE triggers a rapid , PP1-sensitive tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in human CD4+ T cells .
Moreover , we provide evidence that TCR/CD3 and IL-2 induce Stat3 activation via distinct signaling pathways .
Although the role of CD28 in T cell costimulation is firmly established , the mechanisms by which it exerts its costimulatory actions are less clear .
In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of CD28 from subsequent actions of cytokines , such as IL-2 , on T cell proliferation .
Here , we report a model of CD28 costimulation using PMA plus the natural ligand CD80 that resulted in very limited stimulation of IL-2 , as evidenced by both cytokine production and IL-2 promoter stimulation .
Promoter assays revealed CD28-dependent effects on both NF-kappaB and AP-1 , but not on NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter .
In addition , T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Moreover T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking Abs to both IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , demonstrating that this form of costimulation by CD28 was independent of IL-2 .
We also investigated the effects of stimulating T cell blasts with CD80 alone and found that there was a limited requirement for IL-2 in this system .
We conclude that CD28 costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2 , which is driven by a soluble factor independent of NF-AT transactivation .
Flavonoids are a group of naturally-occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom , and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties .
Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized .
In view of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis , prevention of the activation of NFkappaB represents an important role in protecting vascular injury .
In this study , the effects of flavonoids on NFkappaB/inhibitor-kappaB ( IkappaB ) system in ECV304 cells activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) were examined .
We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) activity , an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation .
Of six flavonoids tested , myricetin was found to strongly inhibit IKK kinase activity , and prevent the degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in activated endothelial cells .
Furthermore , myricetin was also found to inhibit NFkappaB activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to ECV304 cells .
Therefore we conclude that flavonoids may be of therapeutic value for vascular disease through down regulation of NFkappaB/IkappaB system .

Body weight , body mass index , body fat , lean body mass , blood-glucose , cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , beta-lipoproteins , insulin , gonadotropin , estradiol , testosterone , SHBG , T3 , T4 and TSH levels as well as estradiol and progesterone receptor levels in excised tumor were studied in 40 patients with breast cancer prior to conservative treatment .
Said anthropometric , metabolic and hormonal parameters were compared with the index of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor selected as a prognostic factor .
A significant correlation between high lymphocytic infiltration ( 2.5 points ) , low body mass and fat was identified .
Also , smoking contributed to loss of body mass and fat ; however , it caused lymphocytic infiltration to rise .
Moderate body mass , relatively low fat level and positive receptor status are among factors of good prognosis in breast cancer of early stages .
Expression of the class A macrophage scavenger receptor ( MSR ) contributes to the uptake of modified low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) by macrophages and transformation of these cells into lipid-laden foam cells , which characterize atherosclerosis .
Many environmental factors , in particular , proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors , can exert regulatory effects on MSR expression , whereas intracellular accumulation of cholesterol itself does not influence MSR levels to any considerable extent .
In the present study , by using an in vitro model , we examined whether stimulation with interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , an immunoregulatory , multipotential cytokine , modulates the expression and activities of the MSR in macrophages .
When treated with IL-6 , macrophages derived from peripheral monocytes and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -differentiated THP-1 monocytic cells showed significantly reduced uptake and/or binding of the MSR ligand , acetylated LDL .
This effect was paralleled by a reduction in the expression of MSR protein and mRNA .
Analysis of MSR promoter activity in THP-1 cells transfected with an MSR promoter-reporter gene construct demonstrated decreased activity of the MSR promoter in IL-6-treated THP-1 macrophages .
Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay also showed a reduction in the binding of a transcription factor to the MSR promoter AP-1/ets elements in IL-6-treated cells .
Thus , exposure to IL-6 may inhibit expression of the class A MSR in differentiated macrophages at transcriptional levels .
This result suggests that this cytokine may modulate foam cell formation during atherogenesis .
Different types of acute myeloid leukemia blast cells were induced to differentiate in vitro with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and vitamin D3 ( VD ) .
M0/M1 leukemic cells are not sensitive to differentiating agents , whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are not sensitive to VD .
M2 leukemic blast cells behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers .
To gain some insight into the maturation of M2-type leukemic cells , we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous M2 blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 cells ( an acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line ) .
Our results indicate that ATRA as well as VD efficiently increases the nuclear abundance of VD receptor ( VDR ) and promotes monocytic differentiation .
VDR is functionally active in ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells because it efficiently heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor , binds to a DR3-type vitamin D-responsive element , and activates the transcription of a vitamin D-responsive element-regulated reporter gene .
Consistent with these findings , VD-responsive genes are induced by ATRA treatment of Kasumi-1 cells , suggesting that the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation is activated .
The molecular mechanism by which ATRA increases the nuclear abundance of a functional VDR is still unknown , but our data clearly indicate that the M2 leukemic cell context is only permissive of monocytic differentiation .
Adenoviruses encode proteins that block responses to interferons , intrinsic cellular apoptosis , killing by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes and killing by the death ligands TNF , Fas ligand and TRAIL .
The viral proteins are believed to prolong acute and persistent adenovirus infections .
The proteins may prove useful in protecting adenovirus gene therapy vectors and transplanted cells from the immune system .
Central to the bone-sparing effect of estrogen ( E ( 2 ) ) is its ability to block the monocytic production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine TNF-alpha ( TNF ) .
However , the mechanism by which E ( 2 ) downregulates TNF production is presently unknown .
Transient transfection studies in HeLa cells , an E ( 2 ) receptor-negative line , suggest that E ( 2 ) inhibits TNF gene expression through an effect mediated by estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) .
We also report that in RAW 264.7 cells , an E ( 2 ) receptor-positive murine monocytic line , E ( 2 ) downregulates cytokine-induced TNF gene expression by decreasing the activity of the Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) .
The resulting diminished phosphorylation of c-Jun and JunD at their NH(2)-termini decreases the ability of these nuclear proteins to autostimulate the expression of the c-Jun and JunD genes , thus leading to lower production of c-Jun and JunD .
The consequent decrease in the nuclear levels of c-Jun and JunD leads to diminished binding of c-Jun/c-Fos and JunD/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus sequence in the TNF promoter and , thus , to decreased transactivation of the TNF gene .
AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( AIDS NHL ) comprises a diverse and heterogeneous group of high-grade B cell tumors .
Certain classes of AIDS NHL are associated with alterations in oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes or infections by oncogenic herpesviruses .
However , the clinically significant class of AIDS NHL designated immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid ( AIDS IBLP ) lacks any consistent genetic alterations .
We identified the TCL1 oncogene from a set of AIDS IBLP-associated cDNA fragments generated by subtractive hybridization with non-AIDS IBLP .
Aberrant TCL1 expression has been implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development , and its expression also has been seen in many established B cell tumor lines .
However , TCL1 expression has not been reported in AIDS NHL .
We find that TCL1 is expressed in the majority of AIDS IBLP tumors examined .
TCL1 protein expression is restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP tissue samples analyzed with immunohistochemical staining .
Hyperplastic lymph node and tonsil also exhibit strong TCL1 protein expression in mantle zone B cells and in rare interfollicular zone cells , whereas follicle-center B cells ( centroblasts and centrocytes ) show weaker expression .
These results establish TCL1 as the most prevalent of all of the surveyed oncogenes associated with AIDS IBLP .
They also indicate that abundant TCL1 expression in quiescent mantle zone B cells is down-regulated in activated germinal center follicular B cells in parallel to the known expression pattern of BCL-2 .
High-level expression in nonproliferating B cells suggests that TCL1 may function in protecting naive preactivated B cells from apoptosis .
BACKGROUND : Alveolar macrophages play a key role in the initiation of the inflammatory reaction of allergic asthma .
Alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes are activated when IgE/allergen immune complexes bind to the CD23 receptor , which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines .
OBJECTIVE : We sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating this early inflammatory response .
We have focused on the study of the signal transduction pathways triggered by CD23 in human monocytes and the promonocytic cell line U937 .
METHODS : CD23 was cross-linked in human monocytes and U937 cells with IgE immune complexes .
Surface expression of CD23 was determined by FACS analysis .
Transcription factor activation and gene transcription were studied by gel-shift assays and Northern blot analysis , respectively .
IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation was analyzed by Western blot .
RESULTS : Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB is the main transcription factor involved in the gene activation that follows CD23 cross-linking in monocytes .
CD23-induced NF-kappaB is a heterodimer composed of p65/p50 subunits .
NF-kappaB nuclear translocation is secondary to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory molecule IkappaBalpha .
Tyrosine kinase-dependent , and not protein kinase C-dependent , pathways mediate CD23-triggered NF-kappaB activation but do not participate in the direct phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha .
IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation correlate with transcriptional activation of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta .
CONCLUSIONS : NF-kappaB is the main transcription factor involved in the signal transduction pathway of CD23 in monocytes .
The inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) are potent activators of NF-kappaB .
This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) signalsome activation and IkappaB phosphorylation/proteolysis in human monocytic cells and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-alpha , IKK-beta , NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , IKK-gamma ( NF-kappaB essential modulator ) , and IKK complex-associated protein .
Kinase assays showed that TNF elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK-alpha than on IKK-beta , peaking at 5 min .
In contrast , LPS predominantly stimulated IKK-beta activity , which slowly increased , peaking at 30 min .
A second peak was observed at a later time point following LPS stimulation , which consisted of both IKK-alpha and -beta activity .
The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation .
Furthermore , our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK , IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells .
Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome , whereas IKK-alpha , IKK-beta , and NIK remained complex-associated .
NIK can not phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly , but it appears to be a functionally important subunit , because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta .
Overexpression of IKK complex-associated protein inhibited stimulus-mediated transcription , whereas NF-kappaB essential modulator enhanced it .
The understanding of LPS- and TNF-induced signaling may allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease .
AML1 plays a critical role during hematopoiesis and chromosomal translocations involving AML1 are commonly associated with different forms of leukemia , including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation , we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene , blk .
Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity .
Furthermore , in vitro binding analysis revealed that the AML1 runt DNA-binding domain physically interacts with the paired DNA-binding domain of BSAP , a B cell-specific transcription factor .
BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene .
Physical interaction of AML1 with BSAP correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate blk promoter transcription by more than 50-fold .
These results demonstrate physical and functional interactions between AML1 and BSAP and suggest that AML1 is an important factor for regulating a critical B cell-specific gene , blk .
Estrogen receptors are found on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells ; their expression is influenced by exposure to the hormone .
Estrogen receptors influence non-genomic events , which are rapid in onset and genomic events , which are longer acting responses .
Estrogens affect vascular tone indirectly by modulating release of endothelium-derived vasoactive factors and directly by modulating intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells .
Estrogens indirectly affect thrombotic events and inflammation by altering platelet aggregation and leukocyte adherence and migration , respectively .
Estrogens also influence production of mitogens which , when released at sites of vascular injury , affect vascular remodeling .
Although estrogens initiate vascular responses , genomic sex may influence and/or limit expression of estrogen receptors and therefore actions of sex steroid hormones throughout the vasculature .
E1A oncogene expression increases mammalian cell susceptibility to lysis by cytolytic lymphocytes ( CLs ) at a stage in this intercellular interaction that is independent of cell surface recognition events .
Since CLs can induce either apoptotic or necrotic cell death , we asked whether E1A sensitization to injury-induced apoptosis is sufficient to explain E1A-induced cytolytic susceptibility .
Mouse , rat , hamster , and human cells that were rendered cytolytic susceptible by E1A were also sensitized to CL-induced and chemically induced apoptosis .
In contrast , E1A-positive cells were no more susceptible to injury-induced necrosis than E1A-negative cells .
Similar to induction of cytolytic susceptibility and in contrast to other E1A activities , cellular sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis depended on high-level E1A oncoprotein expression .
Loss of both cytolytic susceptibility and sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis was coselected during in vivo selection of E1A-positive sarcoma cells for increased tumorigenicity .
Furthermore , E1A mutant proteins that can not bind the cellular transcriptional coactivator , p300 , and that fail to induce cytolytic susceptibility also failed to sensitize cells to injury-induced apoptosis .
These data indicate that E1A induces susceptibility to killer cell-induced lysis through sensitization of cells to injury-induced apoptosis .

Experimental evidence suggest an important role of polyamines in breast cancer development .
Polyamines have been determined in tissue and erythrocyte samples from 100 patients with primary invasive breast cancer and 30 patients with fibroadenomas .
Statistical analysis was performed in order to determine the prognostic value of the polyamine patterns of tumor tissues and erythrocytes in comparison with clinical and histological prognostic factors .
In malignant tissues , polyamine levels were significantly higher than in benign tissues .
They correlated with markers of tumor aggressivity ( axillary node involvement and especially with markers of high mitotic rate as Ki-67 staining , histological grade ) .
No correlation was found between estrogen and progesterone status , tumor size and polyamine concentrations .
Erythrocyte polyamines levels were identical between cancer patients and controls .
The knowledge of the polyamine pattern in breast cancer could become useful in clinical practice particularly if polyamine metabolism is targeted as a therapeutic approach .
Single C motif-1 ( SCM-1 ) /lymphotactin is a C-type chemokine whose expression is activation dependent , cyclosporin A sensitive and restricted to CD8+ T cells , double-negative thymocytes , gammadelta-type T cells , and NK cells .
In humans , there are two highly homologous genes encoding SCM-1alpha and SCM-1beta .
Here we examined the regulatory mechanism of the SCM-1 genes .
The luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5' flanking region of 0.7 kb was strongly induced upon activation with anti-CD3 or PHA plus PMA only in SCM-1-producer T cell lines through a cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism .
An element termed E1 located at -108 to -95 nt relative to the major transcription start site was found to be critical for the promoter activity .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the E1 oligonucleotide as probe , nuclear extracts from unstimulated T and B cell lines formed a constitutive complex termed complex I , while nuclear extracts from stimulated SCM-1-producer T cell lines formed a higher mobility complex termed complex II with a concomitant decrease in complex I .
The shift from complex I to complex II seen only in SCM-1-producer T cell lines upon activation was completely suppressed by cyclosporin A .
Both complexes were critically dependent on the NF-AT core sequence TTTCC in the E1 element and were partially supershifted by anti-NF-ATp .
One-hybrid assays in yeast isolated NF-ATp as an E1 binding protein , and transfection of NF-ATp into T and B cell lines strongly enhanced the activation-dependent SCM-1 promoter activity .
Collectively , a unique mechanism involving NF-ATp appears to regulate the cell type-specific and activation-dependent expression of the SCM-1 genes .
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that act on a variety of immune cells , including monocytes and macrophages .
However , the exact cellular mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory capacity are still unknown .
In our study , we determined the induction of apoptosis by GC in human monocytes .
Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by density centrifugation methods with a purity of > 90 % and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium .
Monocyte apoptosis was determined by four independent methods , including annexin-V staining , TUNEL , DNA-laddering , and typical morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy .
TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were measured by ELISA .
GC receptor was blocked with mifepristone .
Caspase 3 was inhibited with caspase-3 inhibitor ( DEVD-CHO ) .
Stimulation with different GC at therapeutic concentrations resulted in monocyte apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner .
Necrosis was excluded by propidium iodide staining .
Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were down-regulated by GC treatment .
Continuous treatment of monocytes with IL-1beta , but not with TNF-alpha , could almost completely prevent GC-induced cell death .
The addition of mifepristone or caspase-3 inhibitor could partially abrogate GC-induced apoptosis as well as GC-induced inhibition of IL-1beta .
This is the first study to demonstrate induction of apoptosis by GC in human monocytes .
GC-induced monocyte apoptosis may be partially mediated through effects on IL-1beta production .
It is conceivable that GC exert their anti-inflammatory capacity in various diseases , at least in part , by the induction of apoptosis in monocytes .
An early event in acute and chronic inflammation and associated diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis is the induced expression of specific adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells ( ECs ) , which subsequently bind leukocytes .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) , members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors , are activated by fatty acid metabolites , peroxisome proliferators , and thiazolidinediones and are now recognized as important mediators in the inflammatory response .
Whether PPAR activators influence the inflammatory responses of ECs is unknown .
We show that the PPAR activators 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -prostaglandin J ( 2 ) ( 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) ) , Wyeth 14643 , ciglitazone , and troglitazone , but not BRL 49653 , partially inhibit the induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , as measured by ELISA , and monocyte binding to human aortic endothelial cells ( HAECs ) activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide .
The " natural " PPAR activator 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) had the greatest potency and was the only tested molecule capable of partially inhibiting the induced expression of E-selectin and neutrophil-like HL60 cell binding to PMA-activated HAECs .
Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 induction by PMA was unaffected by any of the molecules tested .
Both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma mRNAs were detected in HAECs by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a ribonuclease protection assay ; however , we have yet to determine which , if any , of the PPARs are mediating this process .
These results suggest that certain PPAR activators may help limit chronic inflammation mediated by VCAM-1 and monocytes without affecting acute inflammation mediated by E-selectin and neutrophil binding .
Monocyte migration and activation are regulated by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) .
Prior studies have shown MCP-1 expression is modulated by a variety of ligands that act through extracellular receptors .
In the current study , we show 9-cis retinoic acid ( RA ) , a ligand for the nuclear hormone receptor retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , markedly induces the expression of MCP-1 .
In human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells cultured with RA ( 0.05 to 500 nmol/L ) , MCP-1 expression was induced rapidly , significantly , and dose-dependently by as much as 165-fold .
MCP-1 RNA level was also increased in RA-treated cells .
Expression of PPARgamma , a heterodimer partner of RXR , is also markedly induced by RA in THP-1 cells .
However , BRL49653 , a PPARgamma ligand , failed to induce MCP-1 secretion either alone or to modify the expression level induced by RA .
In contrast , BRL49653 significantly increased MCP-1 ( biotinylated MCP-1 ) binding to THP-1 cells , whereas RA had no effect .
Other peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( PPAR ) ligands , 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and troglitazone ( PPARgamma ) , Wy14 , 643 ( PPARalpha ) , and PD195599 ( PPARbeta ) inhibited the induction of MCP-1 by RA .
RA 's effect on MCP-1 expression in human elutriated monocytes were similar to that observed in the THP-1 cells .
These studies identify RA as a nuclear signal for MCP-1 induction in undifferentiated human monocytic cells .
These studies also suggest monocyte MCP-1 expression induced through RA may modulate cell migration .
Neutrophil maturation occurs in well defined morphological stages that correlate with the acquisition of molecular markers associated with neutrophil function .
A variety of factors are known to play a role in terminal neutrophil maturation , including the vitamin A derivative , retinoic acid .
Retinoic acid can directly modulate gene expression via binding to its nuclear receptors , which can , in turn , activate transcription of target genes .
A role for retinoic acid during neutrophil maturation has been suggested from a variety of sources .
Here we present a review of the mechanism of retinoic acid receptor action and the major evidence showing that normal retinoid signaling is required for neutrophil maturation .
Cell-mediated immunity plays an essential role in the control of infection with the human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) .
However , only a few CD8(+)-T-cell epitopes are known , with the majority being contained in the pp65 phosphoprotein , which is believed to dominate the CD8(+)-T-cell response to HCMV .
Here , we have readdressed the issue of CD8(+) T cells specific for the 72-kDa major immediate-early protein ( IE-1 ) , which is nonstructural but is found very early and throughout the replicative cycle .
Using a novel flow-cytometric assay , we were able to identify CD8(+)-T-cell epitopes ( by IE-1 peptide-specific induction of cytokine synthesis ) and simultaneously measure the frequency of cells directed against them .
For this purpose , 81 pentadecamer peptides covering the complete 491-amino-acid sequence of IE-1 were tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-seropositive donors .
At least 10 new epitopes were identified , and the fine specificity and presenting HLA molecule of the first of them was determined .
The frequencies of CD8(+) T cells directed against IE-1 were similar to those directed against pp65 in donors tested with known pp65-derived peptides .
Importantly , additional testing of a corresponding set of peptides covering the complete sequence of pp65 on 10 of these donors identified individuals whose CD8(+) T cells recognized IE-1 but not pp65 and vice versa , clearly illustrating that either protein may be a major target .
In summary , our results suggest that IE-1 is far more important as a CD8(+)-T-cell target than current opinion suggests .
The flow of information from calcium-mobilizing receptors to nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) -dependent genes is critically dependent on interaction between the phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFAT .
A high-affinity calcineurin-binding peptide was selected from combinatorial peptide libraries based on the calcineurin docking motif of NFAT .
This peptide potently inhibited NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent expression of endogenous cytokine genes in T cells , without affecting the expression of other cytokines that require calcineurin but not NFAT .
Substitution of the optimized peptide sequence into the natural calcineurin docking site increased the calcineurin responsiveness of NFAT .
Compounds that interfere selectively with the calcineurin-NFAT interaction without affecting calcineurin phosphatase activity may be useful as therapeutic agents that are less toxic than current drugs .
Corticosteroids are the preeminent antiinflammatory agents although the molecular mechanisms that impart their efficacy have not been defined .
The endothelium plays a critical role in inflammation by directing circulating leukocytes into extravascular tissues by expressing adhesive molecules for leukocytes [ e.g. , endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 ( ELAM-1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) ] .
We therefore determined whether corticosteroids suppress inflammation by inhibiting endothelial expression of adhesion molecules for neutrophils ( polymorphonuclear leukocytes ) .
Preincubation of endothelial cells with endotoxin [ lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , 1 microgram/ml ] led to a 4-fold increase in subsequent adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( P < 0.0001 , n = 10 ) to endothelial cells , an increase that was markedly attenuated when endothelial cells were treated with dexamethasone ( IC50 < 1 nM , P < 0.0001 , n = 6 or 7 ) during preincubation with LPS .
Moreover , the steroid receptor agonist cortisol ( 10 microM ) , but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol ( 10 microM ) , diminished LPS-induced endothelial cell adhesiveness .
Further evidence that the action of dexamethasone was mediated through ligation of corticosteroid receptors [ human glucocorticoid receptors ( hGRs ) ] was provided by experiments utilizing the steroid antagonist RU-486 .
RU-486 ( 10 microM ) , which prevents translocation of ligated hGR to the nucleus by inhibiting dissociation of hGR from heat shock protein 90 , completely aborted the effect of dexamethasone on adhesiveness of endothelial cells ( P < 0.0005 , n = 3 ) .
Treatment of endothelial cells with LPS ( 1 microgram/ml ) stimulated transcription of ELAM-1 , as shown by Northern blot analysis , and expression of membrane-associated ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 , as shown by quantitative immunofluorescence ( both P < 0.001 , n = 9 ) .
Dexamethasone markedly inhibited LPS-stimulated accumulation of mRNA for ELAM-1 and expression of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 ( IC50 < 10 nM , both P < 0.001 , n = 4-9 ) ; inhibition of expression by dexamethasone was reversed by RU-486 ( both P < 0.005 , n = 4-6 ) .
As in the adhesion studies , cortisol but not tetrahydrocortisol inhibited expression of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 ( both P < 0.005 , n = 3 or 4 ) .
In contrast , sodium salicylate ( 1 mM ) inhibited neither adhesion nor expression of these adhesion molecules .
These studies suggest that antagonism by dexamethasone of endotoxin-induced inflammation is a specific instance of the general biological principle that the glucocorticoid receptor is a hormone-dependent regulator of transcription .
Primary ( partial ) cortisol receptor resistance was previously reported in a total of 7 patients and 14 asymptomatic family members .
Its occurrence is considered to be extremely rare .
In the present study we report on 6 patients ( 2 males and 4 females ) with the syndrome .
The first male patient presented with mild hypertension .
Hydrochlorothiazide therapy resulted in life-threatening hypokalemia .
The second male patient had slight hypertension without hypokalemia .
All four female patients presented between the age of 20-30 yr with acne , hirsutism , and irregular menstruations .
Low dose dexamethasone therapy ( 1-1.5 mg/day ) was of clinical benefit in these patients .
All patients showed insufficient suppression of serum cortisol concentrations in the overnight 1-mg dexamethasone test .
The diurnal rhythm of ACTH and cortisol was intact , albeit at an elevated level .
There was a normal increase in ACTH , cortisol , and GH ( except in one obese patient ) in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia , while cortisol production was elevated in three patients .
Circulating adrenal androgen levels were increased in all patients .
Glucocorticoid receptors were investigated in a whole cell dexamethasone binding assay in mononuclear leukocytes .
In the first male patient , the number of receptors was very low , while the affinity was lower than that in controls .
A lowered affinity to dexamethasone was found in one female patient , while a lowered number of receptors was found in three patients .
In the second male patient , no abnormalities were found .
As a bioassay for glucocorticoid action we also measured dexamethasone suppressibility of mitogen-stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine in mononuclear leukocytes .
In the male patient with normal receptor status , dexamethasone suppressibility of [3H]thymidine incorporation was significantly lower than that in healthy controls with respect to both maximal suppression and IC50 .
Partial cortisol receptor resistance might be less rare than previously thought .
In the six patients presented , at least three different forms can be recognized .
Therapy with dexamethasone was successful in female patients with acne and hirsutism , as the secondary increase in the production of adrenal androgens was effectively controlled .
Analogs of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 ) with substitutions on C-11 were synthesized .
Small apolar substitutions ( 11 alpha-methyl , 11 alpha-fluoromethyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin D receptor , but larger ( 11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl ) or more polar substitutions ( 11 alpha-hydroxymethyl , 11 alpha-(2-hydroxyethyl ] decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 alpha,25-OH)2D3 .
Their affinity for the vitamin D-binding protein , however , increased up to 4-fold .
The biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 .
The 11 beta-methyl analog had a greater than 10-fold lower activity .
The differentiating effects of the other C-11 analogs on human promyeloid leukemia cells ( HL-60 ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo .
Large or polar substitutions on C-11 of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 thus impair the binding of the vitamin D receptor but increase the affinity to vitamin D-binding protein .
The effects of many C-11-substituted 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 analogs on HL-60 cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism .
To examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels in 25 women with PIH and 25 normal pregnant women , as controls .
Furthermore , we evaluated the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) status in mononuclear leukocytes in the 2 groups .
MR count was significantly ( P less than 0.0005 ) decreased in the PIH group ( 148 +/- 9 binding sites/cell ) compared with the control group ( 300 +/- 17 binding sites/cell ; mean +/- SEM ) .
Plasma aldosterone in women with PIH was 281 +/- 61 pmol/L ; in normal pregnant women it was 697 +/- 172 pmol/L ( P less than 0.025 ) .
Plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone was also significantly ( P less than 0.025 ) lower ( PIH , 1071 +/- 149 pmol/L ; controls , 1907 +/- 318 pmol/L ) .
These values were determined at the onset of clinical symptoms of PIH .
These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher levels of mineralocorticoids in PIH ; a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid may , thus , be responsible for the hypertension and altered MR status .
Mineralocorticoid effector mechanisms were evaluated in 29 patients with preeclampsia and in 25 uncomplicated pregnancies by measurement of plasma aldosterone , levels of mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) in mononuclear leucocytes , and subtraction potential difference ( SPD ; rectal minus oral values ) .
Mean values for plasma aldosterone were not different between the two groups , but significant differences were observed for MR ( preeclampsia , 81 +/- 44 receptors/cell ; controls , 306 +/- 168 ) and SPD ( preeclampsia , 65 +/- 7 mV ; controls , 12 +/- 5 mV ) .
In six cases we determined MR , plasma aldosterone , and SPD in patients with preeclampsia before and 3 months after delivery .
MR were reduced before delivery ( 96 +/- 27 receptors/cell ) , and SPD increased ( 64 +/- 8 mV ) , with both parameters normalizing after delivery ( MR , 242 +/- 79 ; SPD , 14.0 +/- 4 mV ) .
Aldosterone levels returned to normal nonpregnant values after delivery .
These data suggest an important role for abnormalities in mineralocorticoid effector mechanisms in the etiology of preeclampsia and could be an useful marker for diagnosis .
High affinity receptors ( VDR ) for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( calcitriol ) are expressed in HL60 human leukemia cells and in low numbers in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) .
HL60 cells , expressing some characteristics of promyelocytes , can be induced to monocytoid differentiation by calcitriol .
Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was examined after exposure of whole cells to 10(-9) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei .
Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was found to be time dependent reaching a maximum of approximately 2100 binding sites/nucleus after 3 h of incubation in HL60 cells , whereas a maximum of approximately 310 binding sites/nucleus was found after 3 h in PBL .
Pulse exposure of HL60 to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately 1600 radiolabeled VDR by 8 h and approximately 1000 VDR by 24 h .
Radiolabeled VDR disappeared from the nuclear compartment with a halflife of approximately 30 min if cells were cultured with identical concentrations of unlabeled hormone after the pulse ( pulse/chase-experiments ) .
No difference of VDR retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in PBL , where VDR halflife was approximately 30 min .
No specific translocation into the nuclear compartment was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [3H]calcitriol .
Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone -- in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells -- did not disappear from the nuclear compartment upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound .
The activity of DNA relaxing enzymes ( e.g. topoisomerases I and II ) in nuclear extracts was measured using a PBR 322-relaxation-assay .
Enhanced overall enzyme activity was found in nuclear extracts by 1 h after incubation with calcitriol ( final ethanol concentration 0.0001 % v/v ) in HL60 and PBL .
The enhanced activity disappeared after 2 h in PBL , whereas it was still enhanced by 4 h in HL60 .
No effect was seen in ethanol treated controls .
We conclude that a specific nuclear translocation mechanism exists for calcitriol in both cell types examined , most likely due to translocation of receptor proteins after hormone binding .
Translocated hormone/receptor complexes compete for a limited number of specific nuclear binding sites .
Enhanced activity of topoisomerases in nuclear extracts upon translocation of VDR might reflect interaction of both within the nuclear compartment , thus initiating DNA-unwinding , a prerequisite of transcription initiation .
Binding of 3H-dexamethasone and 3H-aldosterone by peripheral lymphocyte receptors was investigated in healthy persons and hypertensive patients before and after 2-week captopril treatment .
The number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites was increased in hypertensives vs normotensives .
The treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril led to activation of hormone-receptor interactions .
There was a more marked rise of the number of receptors in middle-aged ( 44-55 years ) hypertensives vs elderly ( 61-80 years ) subjects after captopril treatment .
1 . The purpose of these studies was to investigate the modulation of the proliferation of human T cells obtained from peripheral blood by dexamethasone ( DEX ) , isoproterenol ( ISO ) , and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) .
The former two substances interact with T cells via the glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic receptors respectively .
When occupied by their natural ligands , glucocorticosteroids and catecholamines , these receptors have a role in modulating T-cell function during stress .
During the inflammatory response increased levels of PGE2 bind to their receptors on T cells and thus alter responsiveness .
Proliferation of T cells was induced by immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) in the presence or absence of an additional costimulatory signal delivered by anti-CD28 mAb .
2 . Various physiologic concentrations of DEX , ISO , or PGE2 were added at the time of initiation of the cultures and subsequent proliferation of the unstimulated T cells was determined .
The results demonstrate that physiologic concentrations of all three of these agents inhibit the anti-CD3 mAb-induced proliferation of T cells .
3 . Although DEX and PGE2 were equipotent in suppressing T-cell proliferation , ISO was much less effective .
4 . Because concomitant elevations in the peripheral levels of these substances may occur , experiments were performed to determine the T-cell inhibitory effects of DEX together with either PGE2 or ISO .
Synergistic suppression of T-cell proliferation was observed when various concentrations of DEX and PGE2 , but not DEX and ISO , were added to cultures .
This synergistic suppression could not be explained by an increase in cAMP accumulation in T cells stimulated with DEX and PGE2 .
5 . Finally , the addition of anti-CD28 mAb to anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated T cells overcame much of the suppression of proliferation induced by PGE2 or ISO but less so than that induced by DEX .
We have earlier found that in Jurkat cells activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) enhances the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation induced by adenosine receptor stimulation or activation of Gs .
Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) which stimulates PKC and a combination of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA ( 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido adenosine ) and forskolin to raise cAMP , on the levels of c-Fos and Jun and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the transcription factor , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .
PMA treatment caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in both c-Fos and Jun immunoreactivity in contrast to cAMP elevation that had only a slight effect .
Both PMA and the combination of NECA and forskolin acted together either to increase ( c-Fos ) or decrease ( Jun ) protein levels as well as increasing AP-1 binding , as judged by gel-shift assay , and AP-1 transcriptional activity .
Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the PKC stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents .
The results demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of PKC and elevation of cAMP leads to an enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in a T-leukemia cell line , suggesting that the previously observed interaction between the parallel signal transduction pathways may have functional consequences at the level of gene transcription .
Functional studies in extrarenal , non-epithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid , non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements .
These involve activation of the sodium/proton exchanger of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1-2 min .
A second messenger cascade involved is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course .
Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane related rapid responses .
The mechanisms underlying these rapid effects of aldosterone on electrolytes have been extensively studied in human lymphocytes , which thus may represent valuable tools in the delineation of the receptor-effector mechanisms involved .
The unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include its rapid time course , 10,000-fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response .
The v-erbA oncogene , a mutated version of the thyroid hormone receptor alpha ( c-erbA/TR-alpha ) , inhibits erythroid differentiation and constitutively represses transcription of certain erythrocyte genes , suggesting a normal function of the proto-oncogene c-erbA in erythropoiesis .
Here we demonstrate that the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor alpha ( c-erbA/TR-alpha ) and the closely related retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR-alpha ) play a role in the regulation of normal erythroid differentiation .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) distinctly modulated the erythroid differentiation program of normal erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts reversibly transformed by a conditional tyrosine kinase oncogene .
When added pulsewise to immature cells , differentiation was accelerated while more mature cells underwent premature cell death .
Thyroid hormone ( T3 ) alone caused similar but weaker effects .
Interestingly , T3 strongly enhanced the action of RA , suggesting cooperative action of the two receptors in modulating erythroid differentiation .
Expression of the human RAR-alpha in receptor-negative erythroblasts conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise unresponsive cells , thus showing that the RAR-alpha is essential for the RA effect .
Likewise , enhanced expression of exogenous c-erbA/TR-alpha in erythroblasts rendered them susceptible to modulation of differentiation by T3 , suggesting a similar function of both receptors .
We have described the isolation of chemically induced CEM subclones that express CD4 receptors and bind soluble gp120 , yet show a markedly reduced susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 .
Two subclones were found to have an abnormal response to the protein kinase C ( PKC ) activator PMA .
PMA treatment induced CD3 and CD25 ( IL-2R ) receptors on the parental line and on other ethyl-methanesulfonate-derived subclones , but not on these two mutants .
Direct assays of PKC activity were conducted .
Total cellular PKC enzymatic activity was found to be normal in these subclones .
PMA-induced CD4 down-modulation occurred normally .
In addition , activation of c-raf kinase was normal .
Since HIV-1 long terminal repeat contains two functional nuclear factor kB ( NF-kB ) regulatory elements , we studied the ability of PMA to induce NF-kB binding activity by different assays .
Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) assays using the HIV-1 ( -139 ) long terminal repeat-CAT construct showed no PMA induction of CAT activity in these subclones ( unlike the parental line and other subclones ) .
Okadaic acid , an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A , did not overcome the defect in these subclones .
Gel retardation assays , using a 32P-probe containing the HIV-1 NF-kB probe and nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells , showed significantly reduced induction of nuclear NF-kB binding proteins in these two subclones compared with wild type CEM and a control subclone .
Deoxycholate treatment of cytoplasmic extracts from these subclones released much reduced NF-kB binding proteins from their cytoplasmic pools .
Thus , reduced levels of PKC-induced nuclear NF-kB activity in two T cell subclones did not affect their normal cell growth , but correlated with a pronounced reduction in their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection .
The v-erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor .
The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor .
The v-erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA-binding domain relative to that of c-erb A , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for v-erb A function in the neoplastic cell .
We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c-erb A can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a v-erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61 .
Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein , a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations , and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61 .
It therefore appears that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for v-erb A function .
Both normal and malignant cells contain gangliosides as important cell membrane constituents that , after being shed , may influence cells of the immune system .
We have studied the impact of gangliosides on the expression of TNF in blood monocytes and in the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 .
Although under standard culture conditions , bovine brain gangliosides ( 100 micrograms/ml ) suppressed LPS-stimulated TNF production 5-fold in PBMC and 10-fold in Mono Mac 6 cells , suppression was more efficient under serum-free conditions .
Looking at highly purified gangliosides , GD3 , GD1a , GM3 , GM2 , and GM1 were all effective in reducing TNF production in PBMC , and in Mono Mac 6 by factor 10 to 50 .
The suppressive activity was lost in molecules , lacking the sugar moiety or the lipid moiety .
Gangliosides appear to act at an early step of activation in that TNF transcripts were reduced and the mobilization of the nuclear factor kappa B was blocked .
Furthermore , in time kinetics , gangliosides were effective for up to 30 min after addition of LPS , but not thereafter .
However , the expression of the CD14 Ag , a receptor molecule for LPS-LPS binding protein complexes , was unaffected by gangliosides .
Finally , when using Staphylococcus aureus or platelet activating factor as a stimulus , gangliosides were able to suppress TNF production in Mono Mac 6 cells by factor 5 to 10 , as well .
On the other hand , phorbol ester-induced production of O2- was similar in cells treated with and without gangliosides .
Taken together , our data demonstrate that TNF gene expression in monocytes induced by different types of stimuli can be blocked by gangliosides at an early step of signal transduction .
The proto-oncoprotein c-Rel is a member of the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor family , which includes the p50 and p65 subunits of nuclear factor kappa B .
We show here that c-Rel binds to kappa B sites as homodimers as well as heterodimers with p50 .
These homodimers and heterodimers show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various kappa B motifs .
In particular , the c-Rel homodimer has a high affinity for interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and beta interferon kappa B sites .
In spite of its association with p50 in vitro , however , we found a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor in vivo that contains c-Rel but not p50 epitopes ; this factor , termed IL-6 kappa B binding factor II , appears to contain the c-Rel homodimer and preferentially recognizes several IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs .
Although it has been previously shown that the IL-6 kappa B motif functions as a potent IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-responsive element in nonlymphoid cells , its activity was found to be repressed in lymphoid cells such as a Jurkat T-cell line .
We also present evidence that IL-6 kappa B binding factor II functions as a repressor specific for IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs in lymphoid cells .
It has been found that the number of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of healthy elderly subjects increases , while the number of mineralocorticoid receptors decreases .
The mechanisms of hormone-receptor interactions in hypertension are activated : the number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites grows in hypertensive patients .
Still a more essential rise in the number of receptors is observed in mid-age hypertensive patients than in elderly ones .
The work reviewed in this article separates T cell development into four phases .
First is an expansion phase prior to TCR rearrangement , which appears to be correlated with programming of at least some response genes for inducibility .
This phase can occur to some extent outside of the thymus .
However , the profound T cell deficit of nude mice indicates that the thymus is by far the most potent site for inducing the expansion per se , even if other sites can induce some response acquisition .
Second is a controlled phase of TCR gene rearrangement .
The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular loci for rearrangement are still not known .
It seems that the rearrangement of the TCR gamma loci in the gamma delta lineage may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of TCR beta in the alpha beta lineage , and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge .
In the TCR alpha beta lineage , however , the final gene rearrangement events are accompanied by rapid proliferation and an interruption in cellular response gene inducibility .
The loss of conventional responsiveness is probably caused by alterations at the level of signaling , and may be a manifestation of the physiological state that is a precondition for selection .
Third is the complex process of selection .
Whereas peripheral T cells can undergo forms of positive selection ( by antigen-driven clonal expansion ) and negative selection ( by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death ) , neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex .
Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness : instead of turning on IL-2 expression , the activated cell destroys its own chromatin .
The genes that need to be induced for this response are not yet identified , but it is unquestionably a form of activation .
It is interesting that in humans and rats , cortical thymocytes undergoing negative selection can still induce IL-2R alpha expression and even be rescued in vitro , if exogenous IL-2 is provided .
Perhaps murine thymocytes are denied this form of rescue because they shut off IL-2R beta chain expression at an earlier stage or because they may be uncommonly Bcl-2 deficient ( cf. Sentman et al. , 1991 ; Strasser et al. , 1991 ) .
Even so , medullary thymocytes remain at least partially susceptible to negative selection even as they continue to mature .
1 . This study was designed to investigate the presence of estrogen type I ( high affinity , low capacity ) and type II ( low affinity , high capacity ) binding sites in human peripheral blood monocytes and the effects of danazol on these sites .
2 . These two types of estrogen binding sites existed in human peripheral blood monocytes .
3 . Danazol bound to these sites in high concentration ( 10(-6) M , clinical serum concentration during danazol therapy ) and decreased the number of both sites .
4 . It is suggested that danazol has an anti-estrogenic action to the monocytes through the competition and suppression of estrogen binding sites as seen in the estrogen target organ .
A major difficulty in determination of glucocorticoid receptor sites is the very complicated assay procedure .
Therefore , we describe a microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [3H]-dexamethasone as radioligand .
This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably .
Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple blood samples in parallel , we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test if glucocorticoid receptor binding is altered in this ' stressful ' disease .
On the first day of the disease , glucocorticoid receptor capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity , whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again .
This result fits well into the general observation of stress-induced down-regulation of immune responses .
We report here that interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain ( p55 ) .
Similarly , IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937 , but not in resting human T-cells .
This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2 .
Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence ( -291 to -245 ) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated .
In addition , IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor , whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged .
A single point assay of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in human lymphocytes based on the measurement of specific dexamethasone binding has been developed and compared with a common multi-point Scatchard analysis .
The assay conditions - concentration of the ligand 20 nmol/l , incubation time 2 h and the cell count 2-6 mil. cells/tube in the assay volume 0.25 ml were found to be optimal .
An attempt was also undertaken to use a cell harvester for the separation of cells from unbound ligand .
Though specifically bound dexamethasone measured by whole-cell assay and that using cell harvester correlated well , almost by one order lower values obtained with the latter method render it non-applicable for receptor quantitation .
The results from 9 healthy volunteers ( average GR concentration 7131 +/- 1256 sites/cell ) correlated excellently with those obtained by the Scatchard analysis .
The single point assay has been also applied for determination of GH in 10 children treated with large doses of prednisone .
The average values from healthy volunteers did not differ significantly from those found in these children , though much broader range was found in patients .
A novel B cell-restricted activity , required for high levels of octamer/Oct-dependent transcription from an immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) promoter , was detected in an in vitro system consisting of HeLa cell-derived extracts complemented with fractionated B cell nuclear proteins .
The factor responsible for this activity was designated Oct coactivator from B cells ( OCA-B ) .
OCA-B stimulates the transcription from an IgH promoter in conjunction with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but shows no significant effect on the octamer/Oct-dependent transcription of the ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter and the transcription of USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters .
Taken together , our results suggest that OCA-B is a tissue- , promoter- , and factor-specific coactivator and that OCA-B may be a major determinant for B cell-specific activation of immunoglobulin promoters .
In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between Oct factors and OCA-B , we propose a mechanism of action for OCA-B and discuss the implications of OCA-B for the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific promoters .
The 1311-base pair human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha promoter region was fused to the luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene and studied in a transient transfection system in three TNF producing cell lines , the U937 macrophage cell line , the MLA 144 T cell line , and the 729-6 B cell line .
This full length promoter construct can be induced by phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) in each of these cell types .
Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements .
A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -95 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site .
Within this region , single AP-2- and AP-1- like consensus sequences were noted .
These AP-2 and AP-1 sites were each modified with a double point mutation .
A modest ( 20-50 % ) reduction in TNF promoter activity was observed with the AP-2 site mutation .
However , mutation of the AP-1 site markedly diminished both the basal and PMA-activated promoter activity .
Also co-transfections of the wild-type promoter construct with an AP-1/c-jun expression vector resulted in augmented basal and PMA-induced promoter activity .
We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in T lymphocytes and monocytes and mediated through translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells .
We used phenolic , lipid-soluble , chain-breaking antioxidants ( butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , nordihydroquairetic acid , or alpha-tocopherol ( vitamin E ) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells blocks the functions depending on NF-kappa B activation .
BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced , but also constitutive , HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T ( J.Jhan ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines .
This was also true for KBF ( p50 homodimer ) binding activity in U937 cells .
Secretion of TNF , the product of another NF-kappa B-dependent gene , was abolished by BHA in PMA-stimulated U937 cells .
The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol , but not glutathione , content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell , whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level .
Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation .
These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status .
Rather , TNF and PMA can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status , because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation .
It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of NF-kappa B-dependent genes .
The expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun B proto-oncogenes was studied in phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) activated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) from young and aged humans .
Specific mRNAs for c-fos and c-jun were detectable within 30 min after cell activation and reached maximal levels within 2 h .
Both c-fos and jun B mRNAs decreased to pre-activation levels within 6 h , while c-jun mRNA remained elevated .
In PHA-activated PBL , no age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun B mRNA expression .
However , c-jun mRNA levels decreased significantly ( 1.73 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 arbitrary units , P < 0.01 , young vs. old ) in PBL from elderly individuals activated with PHA .
Because previous work has demonstrated that T cells from elderly individuals may display normal proliferative responses when activated via the anti-CD2 pathway , c-jun and jun B mRNA expression was also studied in anti-CD2-activated purified T cells .
No age-related differences were found in the expression of either of these two proto-oncogenes by anti-CD2 activated T cells .
These results suggest that the decreased IL-2 production and proliferative response displayed by PHA-activated PBL from elderly adults may be related to age-related changes in c-jun mRNA expression and in the ratio of c-fos to c-jun mRNA .
We have previously identified a T lymphocyte protein which binds to a site within the LTR of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and exerts an inhibitory effect on virus gene expression .
The palindromic site ( site B ) recognized by this protein is related to the palindromic binding sites of members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family .
Here we characterize the T cell protein binding to this site as a 100 kD protein which is most abundant in T cells and which binds to site B as a 200 kD complex .
This protein is distinct from other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family including the COUP protein which has a closely related DNA binding specificity .
Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals .
Two classes of LTR size variants were found .
One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 .
Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer .
This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence ( CTG-motif ) .
Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites .
No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected .
In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately , equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells .
The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days .
Based on these results we estimate a 5-10 % difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type .
The helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) proteins are a family of transcription factors that include proteins critical to differentiation and development in species ranging from plants to mammals .
Five members of this family ( MYC , SCL , TAL-2 , LYL-1 and E2A ) are implicated in oncogenic events in human lymphoid tumors because of their consistent involvement in chromosomal translocations .
Although activated in T cell leukemias , expression of SCL and LYL-1 is low or undetectable in normal T cell populations .
SCL is expressed in erythroid , megakaryocyte and mast cell populations ( the same cell lineages as GATA-1 , a zinc-finger transcription factor ) .
In addition , both SCL and GATA-1 undergo coordinate modulation during chemically induced erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and are down-modulated during myeloid differentiation of human K562 cells , thus implying a role for SCL in erythroid differentiation events .
However , in contrast to GATA-1 , SCL is expressed in the developing brain .
Studies of the function of SCL suggest it is also important in proliferation and self-renewal events in erythroid cells .
In the human genome , the erythroid-specific hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer regulates the transcription of the downstream beta-like globin genes 10-50 kilobases away .
The mechanism of HS2 enhancer function is not known .
The present study employs RNA protection assays to analyze the transcriptional status of the HS2 enhancer in transfected recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids .
In erythroid K562 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is active , the HS2 sequence directs the synthesis of long enhancer transcripts that are initiated apparently from within the enhancer and elongated through the intervening DNA into the cis-linked CAT gene .
In nonerythroid HL-60 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is inactive , long enhancer transcripts are not detectable .
Splitting the HS2 enhancer between two tandem Ap1 sites abolishes the synthesis of a group of long enhancer transcripts and results in loss of enhancer function and transcriptional silencing of the cis-linked CAT gene .
In directing the synthesis of RNA through the intervening DNA and the gene by a tracking and transcription mechanism , the HS2 enhancer may ( i ) open up the chromatin structure of a gene domain and ( ii ) deliver enhancer binding proteins to the promoter sequence where they may stimulate the transcription of the gene at the cap site .
Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that binds to and transactivates promoters of growth hormone and prolactin genes .
In three unrelated Japanese children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency , we identified three point mutations in the Pit-1 gene , Pro24Leu , Arg143Gln , and Arg271Trp , located on the major transactivation region , POU-specific domain , and POU-homeodomain , respectively .
The chemiluminescent ( CL ) response of interferon-gamma-treated U937 ( IFN-U937 ) cells to sensitized target cells has been used to detect red cell , platelet and granulocyte antibodies .
A clone of U937 cells was selected which expressed Fc receptor I ( Fc gamma RI ) and which , after incubation with IFN-gamma for 72 h , was capable of generating high levels of lucigenin-enhanced CL .
The CL responses of IFN-U937 cells and peripheral blood human monocytes to sensitized red cells , platelets or granulocytes were then compared .
Assays using monocytes or IFN-U937 cells were of comparable sensitivity for detection of antibodies against all three types of target cell .
In addition , the use of IFN-U937 cells reduced interassay variation and simplified assay performance .
The potential clinical usefulness of these CL assays was suggested by the ability of both monocytes and IFN-U937 cells to respond to red cells , platelets or granulocytes sensitized with sera from pregnant women whose babies had either haemolytic disease of the newborn ( HDN ) , alloimmune thrombocytopenia or alloimmune neutropenia respectively .
In addition , monocytes and IFN-U937 cells both responded to red cells sensitized with antibodies against a variety of specificities of assumed ( although not documented ) clinical significance for blood transfusion recipients .
In contrast , monocytes and IFN-U937 cells responded only weakly to red cells sensitized with either anti-D in sera from mothers of babies unaffected by HDN , or with antisera containing high titre antibodies with specificities not normally associated with significantly reduced red cell survival .
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) results from infection with a human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
The long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region of HIV proviral DNA contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , and this transcriptional activator appears to regulate HIV activation .
Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kappa B activation .
The present study was based on reports that antioxidants which eliminate ROS should block the activation of NF-kappa B and subsequently HIV transcription , and thus antioxidants can be used as therapeutic agents for AIDS .
Incubation of Jurkat T cells ( 1 x 10(6) cells/ml ) with a natural thiol antioxidant , alpha-lipoic acid , prior to the stimulation of cells was found to inhibit NF-kappa B activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( 25 ng/ml ) or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 50 ng/ml ) .
The inhibitory action of alpha-lipoic acid was found to be very potent as only 4 mM was needed for a complete inhibition , whereas 20 mM was required for N-acetylcysteine .
These results indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be effective in AIDS therapeutics .
Activation of T cells is initiated by the recognition of antigen on antigen presenting cells to exert the effector functions in immune and inflammatory responses .
Two types of helper T cell ( Th ) clones ( Th1 and Th2 ) are defined on the basis of different patterns of cytokine ( lymphokine ) secretion .
They determine the outcome of an antigenic response toward humoral or cell-mediated immunity .
Although lymphokine genes are coordinately regulated upon antigen stimulation , they are regulated by the mechanisms common to all as well as those which are unique to each gene .
For most lymphokine genes , a combination of phorbol esters ( phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate , PMA ) and calcium ionophores ( A23187 ) is required for their maximal induction .
Yet phorbol ester alone or calcium ionophore alone produce several lymphokines .
The production of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is completely dependent on the two signals .
We have previously found a cis-acting region spanning the GM-CSF promoter region ( positions -95 to +27 ) that confers inducibility to reporter genes in transient transfection assays .
Further analysis identified three elements required for efficient induction , referred to as GM2 , GC-box and conserved lymphokine element ( CLE0 ) .
GM2 defines a binding site for protein ( s ) whose binding is inducible by PMA .
One protein , NF-GM2 is similar to the transcription factor NF-kB .
GC-box is a binding site for constitutively bound proteins .
CLEO defines a binding site for protein ( s ) whose optimum binding is stimulated by PMA and A23187 .
Viral trans-activators such as Tax ( human T cell leukemia virus-1 , HTLV-1 ) and E2 ( bovine papilloma virus , BPV ) proteins are other agents which activate lymphokine gene expression by bypassing T cell receptor ( TCR ) mediated signaling .
The trans-activation domain of E2 and Tax is interchangeable although they have no obvious sequence homology between them .
The viral trans-activators appear to target specific DNA binding protein such as NF-kB and Sp1 to cis-acting DNA site and promote lymphokine gene expression without TCR-mediated stimulation .
Analysis of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene promoter DRA has previously identified at least five cis-acting regions required for maximal expression .
We have examined the DRA promoter for protein-DNA interactions in the intact cell , which may mediate transcriptional activation .
Using in vivo genomic footprinting we identified interactions in B-cell lines at the octamer site and the Y , X1 , and X2 boxes .
Class II antigen expressing T-cell lines maintained contacts identical to B-cell lines , while class II-negative T-cell lines exhibited no interactions .
In lymphoid cell lines , the octamer site is occupied and required for maximal expression .
This is most likely due to the presence of the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 factor .
In contrast , the class II-positive nonlymphoid glioblastoma cell line does not exhibit interactions at the octamer site despite the presence of the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor and an open binding site .
Thus , the DRA promoter discriminates against OTF-1 activation at the level of DNA binding in the glioblastoma line .
Interferon gamma induces class II expression in this glioblastoma cell line and , in parallel , up-regulates X1 and X2 box protein-DNA interactions , while all other interactions remain unchanged .
These results suggest that interferon gamma functions on a poised promoter by altering weak , nonproductive interactions at the X boxes to strong interactions .
These findings provide direct in vivo evidence to strongly suggest that the modulation of X1 and X2 interactions is an important constituent of the interferon gamma induction pathway .
The genes and mechanisms that control programmed cell death are currently the subject of intense study .
The bcl-2 gene , a repressor of lymphocyte death , is perhaps the best understood of the programmed cell death associated genes .
Here , Stanley Korsmeyer provides a brief overview of bcl-2 , concentrating on its roles in B- and T-cell development and in oncogenesis .
We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells .
Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation .
Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction was tested .
PMA , which directly activates PKC , mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun , but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect .
The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7 , a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC , and less efficiently by H-8 , a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC , but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases .
Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence , TRE , and AP-1 enhancer activity , in Jurkat cells .
PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity , whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects .
We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) can establish a persistent and latent infection in CD4+ T lymphocytes ( W.C.Greene , N.Engl.J.

Production of HIV-1 from latently infected cells requires host cell activation by T-cell mitogens ( T.Folks , D.M.Powell , M.M.Lightfoote , S.Benn , M.A. Martin , and A.S.Fauci , Science 231 : 600-602 , 1986 ; D.Zagury , J. Bernard , R.Leonard , R.Cheynier , M.Feldman , P.S.Sarin , and R.C. Gallo , Science 231 : 850-853 , 1986 ) .
This activation is mediated by the host transcription factor NF-kappa B [ G.Nabel and D.Baltimore , Nature ( London ) 326 : 711-717 , 1987 ] .
We report here that the HIV-1-encoded Nef protein inhibits the induction of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity by T- cell mitogens .
However , Nef does not affect the DNA-binding activity of other transcription factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation , including SP-1 , USF , URS , and NF-AT .
Additionally , Nef inhibits the induction of HIV-1- and interleukin 2-directed gene expression , and the effect on HIV-1 transcription depends on an intact NF-kappa B-binding site .
These results indicate that defective recruitment of NF-kappa B may underlie Nef 's negative transcriptional effects on the HIV-1 and interleukin 2 promoters .
Further evidence suggests that Nef inhibits NF-kappa B induction by interfering with a signal derived from the T-cell receptor complex .
The regulation of gene expression during lymphocyte differentiation is a complex process involving interactions between multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements .
In this article , transcriptional regulation of the archetypal T-cell-specific gene , alpha TCR , is discussed .
Major recent developments , including the identification of novel families of transcription factors that regulate multiple T-cell genes during thymocyte ontogeny and T-cell activation , are described .
We have identified a DNA segment that confers responsiveness to antigen stimulation signals on the human interleukin ( IL ) 4 gene in Jurkat cells .
The human IL-4 gene , of 10 kilobases , is composed of four exons and three introns .
A cis-acting element ( P sequence ) resides in the 5' upstream region ; no additional DNA segments with enhancer activity were identified in the human IL-4 gene .
For further mapping purposes , a fusion promoter was constructed with the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter containing 60 base pairs of sequence upstream from the cap site of the mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene and various lengths of the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-4 gene .
The P sequence was located between positions -79 and -69 relative to the transcription start site of the human IL-4 gene , and this location was confirmed by base-substitution mutations .
The plasmids carrying multiple copies of the P sequence showed higher responsiveness to the stimulation .
The binding protein ( s ) that recognize the P sequence of the IL-4 gene were identified by DNA-mobility-shift assays .
The binding of NF(P) ( a DNA binding protein that specifically recognizes the P sequence ) to the P sequence was abolished when oligonucleotides carrying base substitutions were used , indicating that the NF(P) interaction is sequence-specific and that binding specificity of the protein paralleled the sequence requirements for IL-4 expression in vivo .
The P sequence does not share homology with the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene , even though surrounding sequences of the IL-4 gene share high homology with the IL-2 gene .
We conclude that a different set of proteins recognize IL-2 and IL-4 genes .
To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the developmental control of hemoglobin-encoding genes we have been studying the expression of these genes in human cells in continuous culture .
We have previously reported the presence of a transcriptional control element with the properties of a silencer extending from -392 to -177 bp relative to the cap site of the human epsilon-globin-encoding gene [ Cao et al. , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 86 ( 1989 ) 5306-5309 ] .
We also showed that this silencer has stronger inhibitory activity in HeLa cells , as compared to K562 human erythroleukemia cells .
Using deletion mutants and cis-cloned synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides in transient expression assays , nucleotide sequences responsible for this effect have now been further delimited to 44 bp located from -294 to -251 bp .
Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting assays demonstrate that these negative regulatory sequences are recognized differently by proteins present in nuclear extracts obtained from HeLa and K562 cells .
Two binding proteins are detected in K562 nuclear extracts , while only one is found in extracts from HeLa cells .
Possible mechanisms by which these proteins may regulate transcription of the epsilon-globin-encoding gene in erythroid and non-erythroid cells are discussed .
IL-4 secreted by activated T cells is a pleiotropic cytokine affecting growth and differentiation of diverse cell types such as T cells , B cells , and mast cells .
We investigated the upstream regulatory elements of the human IL-4 promoter .
A novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element ( NRE ) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5' flanking region of the IL-4 gene : -311CTCCCTTCT-303 ( NRE-I ) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 ( NRE-II ) .
A T cell-specific protein Neg-1 and a ubiquitous protein Neg-2 binding to NRE-I and NRE-II , respectively , were identified .
Furthermore , a positive regulatory element was found 45 bp downstream of the NRE .
The enhancer activity of the PRE was completely suppressed when the NRE was present .
These data suggest that IL-4 promoter activity is normally down-regulated by an NRE via repression of the enhancer positive regulatory element .
These data may have implications for the stringent control of IL-4 expression in T cells .
The recent definition of a consensus DNA binding sequence for the Ets family of transcription factors has allowed the identification of potential Ets binding sites in the promoters and enhancers of many inducible T-cell genes .
In the studies described in this report , we have identified two potential Ets binding sites , EBS1 and EBS2 , which are conserved in both the human and murine interleukin-2 enhancers .
Within the human enhancer , these two sites are located within the previously defined DNase I footprints , NFAT-1 and NFIL-2B , respectively .
Electrophoretic mobility shift and methylation interference analyses demonstrated that EBS1 and EBS2 are essential for the formation of the NFAT-1 and NFIL-2B nuclear protein complexes .
Furthermore , in vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that inducible interleukin-2 enhancer function requires the presence of either EBS1 or EBS2 .
Two well-characterized Ets family members , Ets-1 and Ets-2 , are reciprocally expressed during T-cell activation .
Surprisingly , however , neither of these proteins bound in vitro to EBS1 or EBS2 .
We therefore screened a T-cell cDNA library under low-stringency conditions with a probe from the DNA binding domain of Ets-1 and isolated a novel Ets family member , Elf-1 .
Elf-1 contains a DNA binding domain that is nearly identical to that of E74 , the ecdysone-inducible Drosophila transcription factor required for metamorphosis ( hence the name Elf-1 , for E74-like factor 1 ) .
Elf-1 bound specifically to both EBS1 and EBS2 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
It also bound to the purine-rich CD3R element from the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 long terminal repeat , which is required for inducible virus expression in response to signalling through the T-cell receptor .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that multiple Ets family members with apparently distinct DNA binding specificities regulate differential gene expression in resting and activated T cells .
1 . In order to further understand the apparent glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder , circadian variation in cortisol concentration , dexamethasone suppression and glucocorticoid receptor binding in mononuclear leukocytes , polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts were measured in rigidly defined major depressive disorder patients and non-depressed psychiatric controls .
2 . Mononuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid , but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects .
3 . Initial and post-dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects .
4 . The phenomenon of glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder remains unexplained .
NF-kappa B is a protein complex which functions in concert with the tat-I gene product to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) transcription .
To determine whether specific members of the NF-kappa B family contribute to this effect , we have examined the abilities of different NF-kappa B subunits to act with Tat-I to stimulate transcription of HIV in Jurkat T-leukemia cells .
We have found that the p49 ( 100 ) DNA binding subunit , together with p65 , can act in concert with Tat-I to stimulate the expression of HIV-CAT plasmid .
Little effect was observed with 50-kDa forms of p105 NF-kappa B or rel , in combination with p65 or full-length c-rel , which do not stimulate the HIV enhancer in these cells .
These findings suggest that the combination of p49 ( 100 ) and p65 NF-kappa B can act in concert with the tat-I gene product to stimulate the synthesis of HIV RNA .
In 19 patients with a malignant breast tumor , tumor tissue and blood were taken to determine the eicosanoid profile and platelet aggregation .
Values were compared with those of patients with benign tumors ( n = 4 ) , or undergoing a mammary reduction ( n = 7 ) .
Postoperatively , blood was taken as well in order to compare pre- and postoperative values .
Eicosanoids were measured in peripheral blood monocytes and mammary tissue by means of HPLC ; furthermore , TXA2 , 6-keto-PGF1 alpha , and PGE2 were determined by RIA .
Differences in pre- and postoperative values of cancer patients were seen in plasma RIA values : PGE2 and 6-k-PGF1 alpha were significantly higher preoperatively when compared with postoperatively , however , such differences were seen in the control groups as well .
Compared to benign tumor or mammary reduction test material the eicosanoid profile of tissue obtained from malignant mammary tumors showed important differences .
Except for PGF2 alpha , HHT and 15-HETE no detectable quantities of eicosanoids were found in the non-tumor material , whereas in the malignant tumor material substantial quantities of a number of eicosanoid metabolites were present .
Statistically significant correlations could be established between patient/histopathology data and the results of the platelet aggregation assays , e.g. between menopausal status and ADP aggregation ; oestrogen receptor ( +/- ) and collagen and arachidonic acid aggregation , inflammatory cell infiltration score and arachidonic acid aggregation and fibrosis score and ADP aggregation .
The results show that eicosanoid synthesis in material from mammary cancer patients is different from that in benign mammary tissue .
The implications , in particular , in relation to future prognosis of the patient , remain obscure .
c-myc protooncogene is implicated in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoid malignancies and high levels of c-myc mRNA expression are observed in activated blood mononuclear cells .
Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) is characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates of exocrine glands , remarkable B cell hyperreactivity and a strong predisposition to B cell neoplasia .
In this study , c-myc protooncogene mRNA expression in 29 labial minor salivary gland biopsies from patients with primary SS and 15 controls was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry .
Two 40mer oligonucleotides from the 1st and the 2nd exon of the c-myc gene , labeled with 35S , were used as probes .
To detect the origin of the cell hybridized with a c-myc probe , a combined immunochemistry in situ hybridization histochemistry technique was used .
High c-myc mRNA expression was detected on acinar epithelial cells .
c-myc did not correlate with c-fos and c-jun protein expression .
Stronger c-myc mRNA expression was detected in labial salivary glands of patients with longer disease duration ( p less than or equal to 0.002 ) and more intense T lymphocyte infiltrates ( p less than 0.05 ) although these patients revealed no hypergammaglobulinemia .
No correlation was observed between c-myc mRNA and B lymphocyte monoclonicity or lymphoma .
In conclusion , strong c-myc mRNA expression was observed on epithelial cells of labial salivary glands from patients with primary SS .
Our findings may indicate the presence of a reactivated virus hosted in these cells .
Oct-2 is a transcription factor that binds specifically to octamer DNA motifs in the promoters of immunoglobulin and interleukin-2 genes .
All tumor cell lines from the B-cell lineage and a few from the T-cell lineage express Oct-2 .
To address the role of Oct-2 in the T-cell lineage , we studied the expression of Oct-2 mRNA and protein in nontransformed human and mouse T cells .
Oct-2 was found in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prepared from human peripheral blood and in mouse lymph node T cells .
In a T-cell clone specific for pigeon cytochrome c in the context of I-Ek , Oct-2 was induced by antigen stimulation , with the increase in Oct-2 protein seen first at 3 h after activation and continuing for at least 24 h .
Oct-2 mRNA induction during antigen-driven T-cell activation was blocked by cyclosporin A , as well as by protein synthesis inhibitors .
These results suggest that Oct-2 participates in transcriptional regulation during T-cell activation .
The relatively delayed kinetics of Oct-2 induction suggests that Oct-2 mediates the changes in gene expression which occur many hours or days following antigen stimulation of T lymphocytes .
The HTLV-I LTR contains three conserved regulatory elements known as 21 base pair repeats which are required for stimulation of gene expression by the transactivator protein tax .
Mutagenesis indicates that the 21 bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs , A , B and C , each of which influences the level of tax activation .
The A site in the 21 bp repeat has strong homology with previously described binding sites for the transcription factor AP-2 .
We demonstrated that AP-2 mRNA was present in T-lymphocytes and that cellular factors from both non-transformed and transformed T-lymphocytes specifically bound to the consensus motif for AP-2 in each 21 bp .
To determine the role of AP-2 in the regulation of the HTLV-I LTR gene expression , we used an AP-2 cDNA in DNA binding and transient expression assays .
Gel retardation and methylation interference studies revealed that bacterially produced AP-2 bound specifically and with high affinity to all three 21 bp repeats , and that it required the core sequence AGGC for specific binding .
Binding of AP-2 prevented the subsequent binding of members of the CREB/ATF family to an adjacent regulatory motif in the 21 bp repeat .
Transfection of an AP-2 expression construct into T-lymphocytes activated gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR .
At least two 21 bp repeats were required for high levels of AP-2 activation and mutagenesis of the AP-2 consensus binding sequences in the 21 bp repeats eliminate this activation .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
The programmed activation/repression of transcription factors in early hematopoietic differentiation has not yet been explored .
The DNA-binding protein GATA-1 is required for normal erythroid development and regulates erythroid-expressed genes in maturing erythroblasts .
We analyzed GATA-1 expression in early human adult hematopoiesis by using an in vitro system in which " pure " early hematopoietic progenitors are induced to gradual and synchronized differentiation selectively along the erythroid or granulocyte-macrophage pathway by differential treatment with hematopoietic growth factors .
The GATA-1 gene , though virtually silent in quiescent progenitors , is activated after entrance into the cell cycle upon stimulation with hematopoietic growth factors .
Subsequently , increasing expression along the erythroid pathway contrasts with an abrupt downregulation in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage .
These results suggest a microenvironment-directed , two-step model for GATA-1 expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitors that involves ( i ) cycle-dependent initiation and ( ii ) lineage-dependent maintenance or suppression .
Hypothetically , on/off switches of lineage-restricted transactivators may underlie the binary fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors .
1,25(OH)2D3 is known to be produced at sites of granulomatous reactions .
In order to characterize the cell types that are targets for this immunoregulatory hormone , we have evaluated the expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and those recovered from the lung by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases ( tuberculosis and sarcoidosis ) and from normal control subjects using combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques .
Lavage T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis or with sarcoidosis , but not those from normal control subjects , expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors as demonstrated by binding of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 , which was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled 1,25(OH)2D3 , but not by the presence of unlabeled 25(OH)D3 ( receptor-positive lymphocytes : sarcoidosis , 20 +/- 12 % ; tuberculosis , 31 +/- 17 % ) .
In contrast , blood lymphocytes from patients with granulomatous diseases did not express detectable 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors .
The percentage of lavage T-lymphocytes expressing 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors was significantly greater for patients with tuberculosis presenting with isolated hilar adenopathy than for patients with pulmonary infiltrates and/or cavities .
1,25(OH)2D3 receptors were expressed to a greater extent on CD8+ T-lymphocytes than on CD4+ T-lymphocytes in sarcoidosis , whereas a greater proportion of CD4+ than of CD8+ T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis were receptor-positive .
These findings support the conclusion that the interaction of 1,25(OH)2D3 with its receptor on T-lymphocytes may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions , but because these receptors are expressed on different lymphocyte populations , the net effect of this potent immunoregulatory molecule is likely different in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis .
This study describes the inheritance of a defect in pyrimidine catabolism and its association with drug-induced toxicity in a patient receiving 5-fluorouracil ( FUra ) as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma .
The study population included the affected patient ( proband ) , nine of her blood relatives , and seven healthy volunteers .
The activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , the initial enzyme of pyrimidine ( and FUra ) catabolism , in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in each subject by a specific radiometric assay using FUra as the substrate .
The proband had no detectable DPD activity .
When enzyme levels in the proband and relatives were compared with that in controls , an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was demonstrated .
This is the third patient with severe FUra toxicity secondary to an alteration in pyrimidine catabolism and the second from our clinic population suggesting that the frequency of this genetic defect may be greater than previously thought .
Monitoring DPD activity may be important in the management of patients experiencing severe toxicity secondary to FUra chemotherapy .
NF-kappa B is a DNA-binding regulatory factor able to control transcription of a number of genes , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) genes .
In T cells , NF-kappa B is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) .
In the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha in a human T cell line ( Jurkat ) and its subclone JCT6 , which presents a deficiency in the PKA transduction pathway .
We found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and TNF alpha were able to activate NF-kappa B .
Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while TNF alpha activation was not .
Furthermore , while PMA activation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor staurosporin , the TNF alpha effect was unchanged .
TNF alpha did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators .
Moreover , cAMP activators did not activate NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells .
Thus , TNF alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein kinase A , or Ca(2+)-regulated kinases .
Furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF-kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC , by a mechanism that increases NF-kappa B/I kappa B dissociation without affecting the NF-kappa B translocation step .
The transcription factor HIV-TF1 , which binds to a region about 60 bp upstream from the enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) , was purified from human B cells .
HIV-TF1 had a molecular weight of 39,000 .
Binding of HIV-TF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activated transcription from the HIV promoter in vitro .
The HIV-TF1-binding site in HIV LTR was similar to the site recognized by upstream stimulatory factor ( USF ) in the adenovirus major late promoter .
DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF .
Interestingly , treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity , suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding .
The disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site induced a 60 % decrease in the level of transcription from the HIV promoter in vivo .
These results suggest that HIV-TF1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 .
Prior studies have identified several elements that contribute to the activity of the IL-2 promoter in the stimulated T cell line , Jurkat .
The sites and their corresponding nuclear binding factors include : NF-kappa B , AP-1 , AP-3 , OCT-1 , and NF-AT .
The latter " nuclear factor for activated T cells " likely contributes to the tissue specificity of IL-2 gene expression .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we have studied these transcription factors in primary T cells from human blood to verify their presence in a physiologic setting and to identify the signals that stimulate factor activity .
All factors are induced in the nuclei of T cells upon activation with mitogens but not with exogenous IL-2 growth factor .
However , the signaling requirements and sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors differ considerably .
Only the activities for NF-AT and AP-1 sites require two signals for optimal induction , i.e. , PMA plus either lectin or antibody to the CD3 or CD28 surface molecules .
Other factors are induced by lectin , antibody , and/or PMA alone .
After appropriate stimulation , both NF-AT and AP-1 are peculiarly sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin .
Our data correlate the activity of NF-AT and AP-1 in gel shift assays with the two signals requirements for IL-2 gene expression .
We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by clone pAT 133 , which is induced upon transition from a resting state ( G0 ) through the early phase of the cell cycle ( G1 ) .
The pAT 133 gene is immediately induced , with FOS-like kinetics , in human T cells and in fibroblasts .
Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three tandem zinc-finger sequences of the type Cys2-Xaa12-His2 .
This zinc-finger region , which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner , is similar ( greater than 80 % on the amino acid level ) to two previously described transcription factors pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 .
Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains , the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct .
This structural similarity suggests that the pAT 133 gene encodes a transcription factor with a specific biological function .
Comparing the regulation of these related zinc-finger-encoding genes showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T lymphocytes and of resting fibroblasts .
However , upon transition from a proliferating ( G1 ) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated .
In human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed , whereas mRNA of pAT 225/EGR1 was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation .
In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591/EGR2 was not expressed in these cells .
This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins .
In vitro effects of aldosterone on the intracellular concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium , cell volume and the sodium-proton-antiport have been described in intact human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) .
In the present paper , the binding of a [125I]-labeled aldosterone derivative to plasma membrane rich fractions of HML was studied .
High affinity binding of the radioligand with an apparent Kd of approximately 0.1 nM was found .
Aldosterone displaced the tracer at a similar Kd .
Both canrenone and cortisol were inactive as ligands up to concentrations of 0.1 microM .
The findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding sites with a high affinity for aldosterone , but not for cortisol .
These data are perfectly compatible with major properties of steroidal effects on the sodium-proton-antiport in HML and thus very likely represent membrane receptors for aldosterone .
The promoters and enhancers of cell type-specific genes are often conserved in evolution , and hence one might expect that a given enhancer has evolved to work best with its own promoter .
While this expectation may be realized in some cases , we have not found evidence for it .
A total of 27 combinations of different promoters and enhancers were tested by transfection into cultured cells .
We found that the relative efficiency of the enhancers is approximately the same , irrespective of the type of promoter used , i.e. , there was no strong preference for any given enhancer/promoter combination .
Notably , we do not see particularly strong transcription when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter .
We propose that a generally permissive enhancer/promoter interaction is of evolutionary benefit for higher eukaryotes : by enhancer shuffling , genes could be easily brought under a new type of inducibility/cell type specificity .
Fibronectin synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to promote CD4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when CD4 cells were cultured with anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone .
In addition , anti-CD29 ( integrin beta 1 ) as well as anti-VLA-5 ( human fibronectin receptor ) antibodies blocked this CD4 cell activation in this system .
Although anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone can not induce IL-2 message by CD4 cells , the combination of anti-CD3 plus fibronectin induced IL-2 message by CD4 cells .
In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated , we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the CD3 pathway of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor .
Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin .
The Thy-1 gene promoter resembles a " housekeeping " promoter in that it is located within a methylation-free island , lacks a canonical TATA box , and displays heterogeneity in the 5'-end termini of the mRNA .
Using transgenic mice , we show that this promoter does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position-dependent manner .
It can only be activated in a tissue-specific manner by elements that lie downstream of the initiation site .
We have analyzed the functional domains of the minimal Thy-1 promoter and show that the dominant promoter elements consist of multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 , an inverted CCAAT box , and sequences proximal to the transcription start site .
DNase I and gel mobility shift assays show the binding of a number of nuclear factors to these elements , including Sp1 and CP1 .
Our results show that the structure of this promoter only permits productive interactions of the two transcription factors Sp1 and CP1 with the basal transcription machinery in the presence of enhancer sequences .
A new homeobox gene , HB24 , has been isolated from a human B-lymphocyte cDNA library .
Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA purified from activated human B cells revealed a single mRNA transcript of approximately 2.3 kb .
Two cDNA clones were sequenced and provided 2,250 nucleotides ( nt ) of DNA sequence information .
There is a single methionine codon-initiated open reading frame of 1,458 nt in frame with a homeobox and a CAX repeat , and the open reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 51,659 daltons .
When the homeodomain from HB24 was compared to known mammalian and Drosophila homeodomains it was found to be only moderately conserved , but when it was compared to a highly diverged Drosophila homeodomain , H2.0 , it was found to be 80 % identical .
The HB24 mRNA was absent or present at low levels in normal B and T lymphocytes ; however , with the appropriate activation signal HB24 mRNA was induced within several hours even in the presence of cycloheximide .
Characterization of HB24 expression in lymphoid and select developing tissues was performed by in situ hybridization .
Positive hybridization was found in thymus , tonsil , bone marrow , developing vessels , and in fetal brain .
HB24 is likely to have an important role in lymphocytes as well as in certain developing tissues .
The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation , two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection .
Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures .
In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production .
We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat .
Furthermore , CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer .
These studies suggest that interaction of CD2 with its natural ligand , LFA-3 , may play a role in regulation of HIV expression .
The v-erbA oncoprotein represents a retrovirus-transduced oncogenic version of the thyroid hormone ( T3/T4 ) receptor c-erbA ( type alpha ) .
It contributes to virus-induced erythroleukemia by efficiently arresting differentiation of red cell progenitors and by suppressing transcription of erythrocyte-specific genes .
Here , we show that v-erbA and c-erbA bind directly to sequences within the promoter of the erythrocyte-specific carbonic anhydrase II ( CAII ) , a gene whose transcription is efficiently suppressed by v-erbA .
This erbA-binding site confers thyroid hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in transient expression experiments and is a target for efficient down-regulation of CAII transcription by the v-erbA oncoprotein .
In stably transformed erythroblasts coexpressing the v-erbA oncoprotein and the c-erbA/T3 receptor at an approximately equimolar ratio , c-erbA activity is dominant over v-erbA .
T3 efficiently induced erythroid differentiation in these cells , thus overcoming the v-erbA-mediated differentiation arrest .
Likewise , T3 activated CAII transcription as well as transient expression of a T3-responsive reporter gene containing the CAII-specific erbA-binding site .
The c-erbA-dependent activation of this CAII reporter construct could only be suppressed by very high amounts of v-erbA .
Our results suggest that overexpression of v-erbA is required for its function as an oncoprotein .
The immune response to the X protein of human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) was studied by epitope mapping by using a set of MS2-HBx fusion proteins and synthetic peptides .
Antibodies in sera of patients with acute and chronic HBV infection showed a multispecific immune response .
Each serum contained antibodies to a different set of epitopes , which taken together cover most of the HBx sequence .
Some of the epitopes were detectable only by immunoblotting with fusion proteins ; others were detectable only by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with synthetic peptides .
The carboxy-terminal half of the HBx protein was preferentially recognized by antibodies from patients with chronic hepatitis and contained a short immunodominant antigenic region with at least two major nonoverlapping epitopes .
Anti-HBx antibody titers as revealed by peptide ELISAs were highest and most frequent in patients with chronic hepatitis and usually low in acutely infected patients and asymptomatic carriers .
The data demonstrate a remarkable qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the humoral HBx immune response which can be monitored by HBx-specific peptide ELISAs .
Such tests may become useful diagnostic tools .
The macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) is required for the growth and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes .
However , the signaling events responsible for these effects remain unclear .
The present studies have examined the effects of M-CSF on potential signaling pathways involving expression of the jun and fos early response genes .
Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in resting human peripheral blood monocytes .
Treatment of these cells with 10(3) units/ml human recombinant M-CSF was associated with rapid and transient increases in c-jun mRNA levels .
Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability studies demonstrated that M-CSF regulates c-jun expression by both an increase in transcription rate and a prolongation in the half-life of c-jun transcripts .
M-CSF treatment was also associated with a rapid induction of the jun-B gene , although expression of this gene was prolonged compared to that of c-jun .
We further demonstrate that M-CSF increases c-fos mRNA levels in human monocytes through control at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
Maximal induction of the c-fos gene was followed by that for the fos-B gene .
Moreover , M-CSF-induced expression of the fos-related gene , fra-1 , was delayed compared to that for both c-fos and fos-B .
Taken together , the results indicate that M-CSF treatment is associated with differential activation of multiple members of the jun/fos family and that expression of these genes could contribute to nuclear signaling mechanisms that regulate a specific program of monocyte differentiation .
Amino acid sequences of all proteins are essays written in the same language .
Accordingly , the same set of words and phrases ( oligopeptides ) appear in totally unrelated proteins .
The reason that only certain individuals of particular major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) haplotypes can mount T-cell responses against a given antigen of pathogens is found in the fact that T-cell receptors are designed to recognize 18-20 residue-long peptide fragments sandwiched between two alpha-helices of class I or class II MHC molecules .
At this range of peptide lengths , most would appear as self , while nonselfness of the remainders are destined to be quite ambiguous , hence creating responders and nonresponders .
We demonstrate that JunD , a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex , activates transcription of the human proenkephalin gene in a fashion that is completely dependent upon the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase A .
Activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD is dependent upon a previously characterized cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca(2+)-inducible enhancer , and JunD is shown to bind the enhancer as a homodimer .
Another component of the AP-1 transcription complex , JunB , is shown to inhibit activation mediated by JunD .
As a homodimer JunB is unable to bind the enhancer ; however in the presence of c-Fos , high-affinity binding is observed .
Furthermore , JunD is shown to activate transcription of genes linked to both cAMP and phorbol ester response elements in a protein kinase A-dependent fashion , further blurring the distinction between these response elements .
These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of an AP-1-related protein is regulated by the cAMP-dependent second-messenger pathway and suggest that JunD and other AP-1-related proteins may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression by cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling pathways .
X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) , an adult-onset form of motor neuron disease , was recently reported to be caused by amplification of the CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene .
We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs .
After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction , a primer extension is carried out ; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture .
The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography .
This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats .
The design of combination hormonal and immunotherapeutic protocols for breast cancer patients may be facilitated by analysis of preclinical in vitro model systems .
Estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ : MCF-7 ) and negative ( ER- : MDA-MB-231 ) human breast cancer cell lines were utilized to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen ( TAM ) and estradiol ( E2 ) on modulation of breast cancer target susceptibility to lysis by lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells .
E2-stimulated ER+ cells were more susceptible to lysis by LAK cells than corresponding TAM-treated or control cells , while treatment of ER- cells with either E2 or TAM alone did not alter from control their susceptibility to this immune-mediated lysis .
All ER+ and ER- cells tested remained sensitive after treatment with TAM to lysis by LAK cells .
In addition , an adenocarcinoma reactive human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody ( ING-1 ) was able to significantly boost in vivo generated LAK cell-mediated lysis of control , E2-treated , and TAM-treated ER+ and ER- cells .
These in vitro results provide a preclinical rationale for in vivo testing of TAM , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , and breast cancer reactive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity facilitating antibody in patients with refractory or high risk breast cancer .
The effects of human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection on cellular differentiation and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity have been investigated in a new model of myeloid differentiation .
PLB-985 cells represent a bipotential myelomonoblastic cell population capable of either granulocytic or monocytic differentiation after induction with appropriate inducers .
By virtue of the presence of CD4 on the cell surface , PLB-985 cells were chronically infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB .
PLB-IIIB cells clearly possessed a more monocytic phenotype than the parental myeloblasts , as determined by differential staining , increased expression of the myeloid-specific surface markers , and transcription of the c-fms proto-oncogene .
NF-kappa B binding activity was inducible by tumor necrosis factor and phorbol myristate acetate in PLB-985 .
However , in PLB-IIIB cells , constitutive expression of a novel NF-kappa B complex was detected , composed of proteins ranging between 70 and 110 kD .
These proteins interacted specifically with the symmetric NF-kappa B site from the interferon beta ( IFN-beta ) promoter .
Mutations affecting the 5' guanine residues of the kappa B site were unable to compete for these NF-kappa B-related proteins .
Inducibility of endogenous IFN-beta and IFN-alpha RNA was also increased in PLB-IIIB cells .
These studies indicate that HIV-1 infection of myelomonoblastic cells may select for a more mature monocytic phenotype and that unique subunit associations of NF-kappa B DNA binding proteins may contribute to differential NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression .
Stimulation of T cells with antigen results in activation of several kinases , including protein kinase C ( PKC ) , that may mediate the later induction of activation-related genes .
We have examined the potential role of PKC in induction of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene in T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex .
We have previously shown that prolonged treatment of the untransformed T cell clone Ar-5 with phorbol esters results in downmodulation of the alpha and beta isozymes of PKC , and abrogates induction of IL-2 mRNA and protein .
Here we show that phorbol ester treatment also abolishes induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Ar-5 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter linked to this reporter gene .
The IL-2 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factors including NFAT-1 , Oct , NF-kappa B , and AP-1 , which are all potentially sensitive to activation of PKC .
We show that induction of a trimer of the NFAT and Oct sites is not sensitive to phorbol ester treatment , and that mutations in the NF-kappa B site have no effect on inducibility of the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast , mutations in the AP-1 site located at -150 bp almost completely abrogate induction of the IL-2 promoter , and appearance of an inducible nuclear factor binding to this site is sensitive to PKC depletion .
Moreover , cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells .
Our results indicate that the AP-1 site at -150 bp represents a major , if not the only , site of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter .
Terminal differentiation of the leukemic cell lines U-937 and HL-60 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by marked changes in gene expression .
In this study , we demonstrate that the expression of jun and fos gene family members is induced with variable kinetics during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced differentiation , with c-jun expression best paralleling differentiation .
The generation of AP-1 complexes , as measured by DNA binding activity , closely parallels morphological differentiation .
Furthermore , the ability of these complexes to regulate gene expression is demonstrated by increased transcription from an AP-1 driven reporter construct and marked increases in the expression of endogenous AP-1 regulated genes .
Differentiation assays using water soluble phorbol esters reveal that differentiation becomes irreversible soon after AP-1 appears .
This tight correlation between c-jun expression , the generation of AP-1 activity , and differentiation suggests a critical role for this gene and transcriptional complex during this process .
A study was made of adrenocortical function by measuring blood plasma cortisol concentration and amount of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes as well as thyroid function by measuring blood plasma triidothyronine and thyroxine concentration in 58 bronchial asthma children aged 1 to 14 years .
The authors revealed alterations in the functional activity of the indicated endocrine glands depending on the intensity of bronchial patency disorders and the nature of the therapeutic measures carried out .
Thrombin plays a critical role in platelet activation , hemostasis , and thrombosis .
Cellular activation by thrombin leads to the phosphorylation of multiple proteins , most of which are unidentified .
We have characterized several 29-kDa proteins that are rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of intact human platelets to thrombin .
A murine monoclonal antibody raised to an unidentified estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein selectively recognized these proteins as well as a more basic , unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein .
Cellular activation by thrombin led to a marked shift in the proportion of protein from the 27-kDa unphosphorylated form to the 29-kDa phosphoprotein species .
Using this antibody , we isolated and sequenced a human cDNA clone encoding a protein that was identical to the mammalian 27-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP27 ) , a protein of uncertain function that is known to be phosphorylated to several forms and to be transcriptionally induced by estrogen .
The 29-kDa proteins were confirmed to be phosphorylated forms of HSP27 by immunoprecipitation studies .
Thus , the " estrogen receptor-related protein " is HSP27 , and the three major 29-kDa proteins phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets are forms of HSP27 .
These data suggest a role for HSP27 in the signal transduction events of platelet activation .
The numbers of estrogen receptor ( ER ) in human peripheral leucocytes in 22 women with climacteric syndrome were measured by radioligand method .
The results were compared with those of 12 normal child-bearing-age women .
It wat found that the contents of leucocytic ER in climacteric syndrome patients were significantly lower than normal child-bearing-age women .
The authors used a Chinese prescription -- Liuwei Dihuang Pills ( LDP ) to treat the patients for 2 months .
The numbers of leucocytic ER were significantly increased after treatment .
The data indicate that decrease of ER levels in cell may involve in the pathogenesis of climacteric syndrome .
LDP not only increases plasma estradiol levels , but also increases the leucocytic ER levels .
This may be the basis of the therapeutic effect on the disease .
The two nuclear proteins NF-kappa B ( consisting of subunits p50 and p65 ) and the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B ( p50 ) by itself , also called KBF1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human T-cell line IARC 301.5 .
In order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa B enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301.5 and a murine myeloma .
Most hybrids express both KBF1 and NF-kappa B in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only KBF1 .
The kappa B enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear NF-kappa B .
These findings show that nuclear NF-kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer , while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient .
We propose that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of NF-kappa B and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes during the immune response .
As many as 27 children aged 6 to 15 years with morphologically verified nephropathies were examined .
Four variants of changes in the thyroid status , characteristic of children with different variants of nephrotic syndrome were distinguished : 1 ) biochemical signs of primary hypothyroidism , 2 ) biochemical signs of secondary hypothyroidism , 3 ) low content of T3 , 4 ) dysfunction of the hypophyseal and thyroid system .
It is shown that the low level of steroid receptors , thyroid hormones that the low level of steroid receptors , thyroid hormones ( T3 and T4 ) and cortisol is typical of children with the signs of renal dysplasia .
It is assumed that superaddition under such conditions of immune glomerulopathy ( glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome ) gives rise to the resistance to the treatment with glucocorticoids .
Plasma cortisol concentration and blood leukocyte content of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) were assayed in 20 patients with deficiency syndromes , 10 cold in property ( deficiency-cold ) , the other 10 hot in property ( deficiency-heat ) , and also in 10 healthy individuals as normal control for the purpose of investigating the nature of cold and heat syndromes .
As a result , the cases of deficiency-cold syndrome ( DCS ) had a normal concentration of plasma cortisol but a lowered content of GCR in leukocytes when compared with the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) ; the cases of deficiency-heat syndrome ( DHS ) had a higher concentration of plasma cortisol than the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) and a slightly higher content of GCR in leukocytes .
It was concluded that the DCS is characterized by diminished biological effects of adrenocortical activity , while the DHS , by augmented biological effects of adrenocortical activity .
CD3-epsilon gene expression is confined to the T cell lineage .
We have recently identified and cloned a human transcription factor , TCF-1 , that binds to a functional element in the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer of CD3-epsilon .
In a panel of human cell lines , TCF-1 expression was restricted to T lineage cells .
TCF-1 belonged to a novel family of genes that contain the so-called high mobility group 1 ( HMG ) box .
Here we report the cloning of murine TCF-1 .
Two splice alternatives were identified that were not previously observed in human TCF-1 .
Murine and human TCF-1 displayed a 95.5 % overall amino acid homology .
Recombinant murine and human TCF-1 recognized the same sequence motif in the CD3-epsilon enhancer as judged by gel retardation and methylation interference assays .
With the murine cDNA clones several aspects of TCF-1 were analyzed .
First , deletion analysis revealed that a region of TCF-1 containing the HMG box was sufficient for sequence-specific binding .
Second , by high stringency Northern blotting and in situ hybridization , TCF-1 expression was shown to be confined to the thymus and to the T cell areas of the spleen .
Third , TCF-1 bound specifically to a functional T cell-specific element in the T cell receptor alpha ( TCR-alpha ) enhancer .
The T lineage-specific expression and the affinity for functional motifs in the TCR-alpha and CD3-epsilon enhancers imply an important role for TCF-1 in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype .
We have cloned a group of cDNAs representing mRNAs that are rapidly induced following adherence of human monocytes .
One of the induced transcripts ( MAD-3 ) encodes a protein of 317 amino acids with one domain containing five tandem repeats of the cdc10/ankyrin motif , which is 60 % similar ( 46 % identical ) to the ankyrin repeat region of the precursor of NF-kappa B/KBF1 p50 .
The C-terminus has a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site .
In vitro translated MAD-3 protein was found to specifically inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the p50/p65 NF-kappa B complex but not that of the p50/p50 KBF1 factor or of other DNA-binding proteins .
The MAD-3 cDNA encodes an I kappa B-like protein that is likely to be involved in regulation of transcriptional responses to NF-kappa B , including adhesion-dependent pathways of monocyte activation .
We have recently identified and cloned TCF-1 , a T cell-specific transcription factor with specificity for the AACAAAG motif in the CD3 epsilon enhancer and for the TTCAAAG motif in the TCR alpha enhancer .
TCF-1 belongs to the family of transcription-regulating proteins which share a region of homology termed the HMG-box .
Here , we show by gel retardation analysis that TCF-1 specifically recognizes the T beta 5 element of the TCR beta enhancer and the T delta 7 element of the TCR delta enhancer .
Comparison of the sequences of all elements recognized by TCF-1 defines a consensus motif A/T A/T C A A/G A G .
These observations imply that TCF-1 is involved in the control of several T cell-specific genes and might thus play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the mature T cell phenotype .
Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response .
Studies of the actions of platelet-activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets .
In this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet-activating factor on B lymphocytes .
Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4 , we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M .
The inactive precursor , lyso-platelet-activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10(-7) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids .
We also show that platelet-activating factor from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso-platelet-activating factor was again ineffective .
We further demonstrate the impact of platelet-activating factor binding to B cells by measuring platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production .
Moreover , platelet-activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun .
Finally we explored the possible role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase A2 .
In summary , platelet-activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure B cell line .
ER content in lymphocytes of peripheral blood from 27 SLE patients and 20 healthy controls were determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay .
ER content in lymphocytes of each sample was expressed by both fmol/mg of lymphocyte cytosolic protein and fmol/micrograms of lymphocyte DNA .
The results showed that there was no significant difference between the ER content of lymphocytes from the controls and that from patients with SLE .
But the logarithmic mean of ER content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/mg of cytosolic protein , in 14 patients with active SLE ( 0.9356 +/- 0.31 ) was significantly higher than that in 13 patients with inactive SLE ( 0.2979 +/- 0.23 , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 0.6204 +/- 0.52 , P less than 0.001 ) .
The normal upper limit of ER content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/micrograms of DNA , was 0.136 .
The elevated rate of ER content in lymphocytes in 14 active SLE ( 92.9 % ) was also higher than that in quieiescent patients ( 23.1 % , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 10 % , P less than 0.001 ) .
Moreover , the elevated level of ER content was found to be related to the positive antidsDNA antibody and hypocomplementemia .
During latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of human B lymphocytes , six viral nuclear antigen ( EBNAs ) are expressed from long primary transcripts by means of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylylation sites .
These transcripts initiate from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , that function in a mutually exclusive fashion .
Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of primary B lymphocytes , followed by a switch to Cp usage .
These studies have been extended to show that ( i ) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes , although the virus contains a functional Cp ; ( ii ) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes , but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences ; ( iii ) this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer ; and ( iv ) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
These results support a model for viral promoter switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of EBNA 2 , followed by activation of Cp through the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
The BZLF1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a key immediate-early protein which has been shown to disrupt virus latency in EBV-infected B cells .
We have generated a monoclonal antibody , BZ1 , to BZLF1 which reacts in immunohistology , immunoblotting , and immunoprecipitation and which recognizes both the active , dimeric form and the inactive , monomeric form of the protein .
Biopsies of oral hairy leukoplakia , an AIDS-associated lesion characterized by high-level EBV replication , were examined by immunohistochemistry using the BZ1 monoclonal antibody .
A differentiation-associated pattern of BZLF1 expression was observed , BZ1 reacting with nuclei of the upper spinous layer of the lesion .
This finding suggests that the BZLF1 promoter may be regulated by the degree of squamous differentiation .
A comparison of in situ hybridization to EBV DNA and viral capsid antigen staining with BZ1 reactivity suggested that BZLF1 expression precedes rampant virus replication .
The inability to detect EBV in the lower epithelial layers of oral hairy leukoplakia raises questions concerning the nature of EBV latency and persistence in stratified squamous epithelium .
Glucocorticosteroids remain the major treatment modality for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , but their mechanism of action is unclear .
Over the past decade it has become clear that glucocorticosteroid receptors play a significant role in the mechanism of glucocorticosteroid action .
We studied glucocorticosteroid receptor density and affinity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the glucocorticosteroid binding assay in 33 patients with SLE who had taken no glucocorticosteroid for the previous 6 months and in 32 healthy controls .
Patients ' disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) .
Glucocorticosteroid receptors on leukocytes of patients with SLE were significantly higher than in healthy controls ( 4419 +/- 306 vs 3369 +/- 196 , p less than 0.005 ) .
The binding affinity was not different between patients and controls .
There was no correlation between glucocorticosteroid receptor number and SLE disease activity .
Macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) , also referred to as CSF-1 , regulates the survival , growth , differentiation and functional activity of monocytes by binding to a single class of high-affinity cell surface receptors , known to be the product of the c-fms protooncogene .
The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the monocyte lineage has suggested that M-CSF may act by an autocrine mechanism .
Interestingly , it has been shown that M-CSF can induce the expression of its own gene .
Although sensitivity to M-CSF can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function , M-CSF responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level .
To date , little is known about the intracellular pathway of M-CSF signal transduction .
We have therefore investigated the changes in protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity upon exposure of monocytes to M-CSF .
We show that M-CSF activates and translocates PKC .
Inhibition of PKC by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of M-CSF by M-CSF .
Furthermore , activation of PKC was pertussis-toxin-sensitive and was associated with the detection of an NF kappa B protein in nuclear extracts of M-CSF-induced blood monocytes but not in monocytes exposed to medium treatment only .
The results suggest that M-CSF induction of M-CSF involves G proteins , PKC and NF kappa B .
Glucocorticoid receptors ( GcR ) were determined by a whole cell assay in human mononulear leukocytes ( hMNL ) from control subjects , patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for systemic diseases and Cushing 's disease patients with or without ketoconazole therapy .
Prolonged corticosteroid treatment resulted in down-regulation of GcR , while the mean level of GcR in Cushing 's disease was normal .
In this group , however , receptor levels and morning plasma cortisol values showed a negative correlation , indicating a subtle down-regulatory effect .
Furthermore , GcR were unaltered after these patients received ketoconazole , in spite of a marked reduction in morning plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol .
We also observed that ketoconazole was a weak competitor of GcR in intact cells , although it significantly inhibited [3H] dexamethasone binding in cytosolic preparations from rat tissues .
The results suggested that GcR in hMNL are down-regulated by synthetic steroids given in vivo , but they showed very mild down-regulation in hypercortisolemic patients suffering from Cushing 's disease .
Finally , we did not observed either up-regulation or antagonism of GcR by ketoconazole treatment , at the time that cortisol levels of patients with Cushing 's disease were reduced .
This indicates that the beneficial effects of ketoconazole in Cushing 's disease are due to adrenal cortisol suppression and not to interaction with GcR of target cells , and that the process of GcR regulation in hMNL is a complex phenomenon awaiting further elucidation .
OBJECTIVE : The aim was to explore the down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptors during hypercortisolaemia in anorexia nervosa .
DESIGN : Urine and plasma samples were obtained for cortisol determination and blood lymphocytes were isolated for receptor binding studies .
PATIENTS : Sixteen anorexic patients , aged 16-27 years , with a mean +/- SEM body mass index of 14.2 +/- 2.0 ( ranging from 11.1 to 17.4 ) , and 15 normal women were studied .
Six patients were reinvestigated after a significant weight gain .
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured with dexamethasone as ligand on lymphocytes .
RESULTS : In patients , both total and free plasma cortisol concentrations were higher than in the normal women , as was their urinary free cortisol ; the number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell ( Ro ) and the binding affinity ( Kd ) for dexamethasone were , however , not significantly different ( Ro : 7687 +/- 1750 vs 7347 +/- 1285 sites/cell ; Kd : 7.7 +/- 2.4 vs 7.4 +/- 1.7 nM at 24 degrees C ) .
After weight gain ( 14 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 2 kg/m2 ) , receptor numbers were 8421 +/- 2126 ( pre ) and 9011 +/- 500 ( post ) sites/cell , which are not significantly different ( P greater than 0.2 ) ; the Kd was unchanged ( 9.3 +/- 2.6 vs 9.2 +/- 2.4 nM ) .
CONCLUSIONS Hypercortisolaemia does not down-regulate the lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors in anorexia nervosa and a post-receptor defect might be involved in peripheral tissue resistance to the effects of glucocorticoid hormones in undernutrition .
Circadian rhythm in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) was studied in the rat liver and human peripheral leukocytes .
For rats exposed to a natural environmental photic cycle or a 12L : 12D artificial light regime , peak values of hepatic GR were detected between 23:00 and 02:00 h .
Except for a 4-hour advancement of the peak , a similar circadian rhythm of hepatic GR was detected in rats reared under a reversed lighting regimen ( 12D : 12L ; lights on between 18:30 and 06:30 h ) .
In human leukocytes , the peak value of GR was found to parallel that of plasma cortisol with high and low values detected at 04:00-08:00 h and 23:00-24:00 h , respectively .
In patients suffering from Cushing 's syndrome , the circadian rhythm of plasma cortisol either disappeared or was inverted while that of GR did not significantly deviate from the normal subjects .
For apoplexic patients with lesions localized to the base of the brain as indicated by computerized tomography , the diurnal variation of GR was abolished .
Conversely , diurnal rhythmicity persisted in apoplexy patients whose lesions were in the cerebral cortex .
Thus , we postulated that the circadian modification of GR was independent of the diurnal fluctuations in plasma cortisol level or the circadian variations in environmental lighting and that the rhythmicity might be regulated by the ' circadian pacemaker ' located in the human basal brain .
These diurnal variations in GR might serve to coordinate the reactivity of the target cells to cortisol because the diurnal rhythms of a GR-mediated response , the fractional inhibition of chemotactic migration rate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by cortisol , were found to be synchronous with those of GR .
HIV-1 proviral DNA contains two binding sites for the transcription factor NF-kappa B .
HIV-1-infected individuals have , on average , abnormally high levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels .
We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B expression .
The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) raise the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) level and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected Molt-4 and U937 cells .
However , inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels .
Cysteine and NAC also inhibit NF-kappa B activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) gene expression under control of NF-kappa B binding sites in uninfected cells .
This suggests that the cysteine deficiency in HIV-1-infected individuals may cause an over-expression of NF-kappa B-dependent genes and enhance HIV-1 replication .
NAC may be considered for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals .
Activation of T cells by antigen , lectin , or a combination of phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) leads to the induction of genes for a set of lymphokines , including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .
We demonstrated in earlier studies that the upstream region of the mouse GM-CSF promoter at positions between -95 and -73 is essential for transcriptional activation in response to PMA/A23187 .
This region contains two DNA-binding motifs , GM2 and GC-box .
The GM2 sequence ( GGTAGTTCCC ) is recognized by an inducible factor NF-GM2 ; the other ( CCGCCC ) by constitutive factors A1 , A2 , and B .
To elucidate the mechanism of GM-CSF gene activation , we have purified the inducible factor NF-GM2 from the nuclear extract of stimulated Jurkat cells on the basis of specific DNA-binding activity .
The purified NF-GM2 consists of 50 ( p50 ) and 65 kDa ( p65 ) polypeptides and has a binding activity specific for both the GM-CSF and immunoglobulin kappa ( GGAAAGTCCC ) enhancers .
Electrophoretically purified p50 alone can form a protein-DNA complex , but in the mixture , p50 associates preferentially with p65 to form the NF-GM2 complex .
In addition , p65 gave per se , with low affinity , a protein-DNA complex that migrated more slowly than native NF-GM2 complex .
Furthermore , an antiserum against KBF1 ( identical to 50 kDa NF-kappa B protein ) reacted with the p50 of NF-GM2 , indicating that the NF-GM2 polypeptide can not be immunologically differentiated from the 50 kDa subunit of NF-kappa B .
The purified NF-GM2 activated in vitro transcription from the kappa B enhancer , while it failed to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter harboring the GM2 sequence .
This suggests that the activation mechanism of the GM-CSF gene through the GM2/GC-box sequence is different from that of genes carrying the kappa B enhancer alone .
We measured glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) isolated from peripheral blood of 145 apparently healthy volunteers ( 86 men and 59 women ) .
An age-related decrease in the number of GR was suggested between subjects younger than 20 years and elderly subjects ; there was no apparent seasonal variation in GR .
Gender difference in the number of GR was not significant , although women showed slightly fewer GR .
Eight patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis were examined to determine whether the number of GR in MNL could be down-regulated by their cognate ligands .
The number of GR in MNL from these patients was significantly decreased one month after the initiation of prednisolone therapy .
However , in normal subjects , the GR in MNL did not demonstrate circadian variation , in contrast to concentrations of plasma cortisol .
We have used a DNA-binding/immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the capacity of human glucocorticoid receptor ( hGR ) , generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates , to bind DNA .
In vitro translated hGR was indistinguishable from native hGR , as determined by migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels , sedimentation on sucrose density gradients , and reactivity with antipeptide antibodies generated against hGR .
In addition , cell-free synthesized hGR was capable of specific binding to glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) -containing DNA fragments .
Using this assay system , we have evaluated the contributions of ligand binding and heat activation to DNA binding by these glucocorticoid receptors .
In vitro translated hGR was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid .
Treatment with dexamethasone or the antiglucocorticoid RU486 had no additional effect on the DNA-binding capacity when receptor preparations were maintained at 0 C ( no activation ) .
In contrast , addition of either ligand or antagonist in combination with a heat activation step promoted DNA binding by approximately 3-fold over that of heat-activated unliganded receptors .
Agonist ( dexamethasone ) was slightly more effective in supporting specific DNA binding than antagonist ( RU486 ) .
DNA binding by in vitro synthesized GR was blocked by the addition of sodium molybdate to the receptor preparations before steroid addition and thermal activation .
Addition of KCl resulted in less DNA binding either due to blockage of DNA-receptor complex formation or disruption of the complexes .
The specificity of DNA binding by cell-free synthesized hGR was analyzed further by examining the abilities of various DNAs to compete for binding to a naturally occurring GRE found in the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat .
Oligonucleotides containing the consensus GRE were the most efficient competitors , and fragments containing regulatory sequences from glucocorticoid-repressible genes were somewhat competitive , whereas single stranded oligonucleotides were unable to compete for mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat DNA binding , except when competitor was present at extremely high concentrations .
Together these studies indicate that hGR synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates displays many of the same properties , including GRE-specific DNA binding , observed for glucocorticoid receptor present in cytosolic extracts of mammalian cells and tissues .
Similarities between the effects of dexamethasone and RU486 suggest that the antiglucocorticoid properties of RU486 do not occur at the level of specific DNA binding .
A total of 37 chronic , severe , nonsmoking asthmatic patients with documented reversible airways obstruction were classified as glucocorticoid-sensitive or -resistant on the basis of changes in FEV1 , FVC , and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) after oral prednisolone .
The resistant patients showed no significant improvements in airflow limitation .
Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes from the sensitive but not the resistant asthmatic patients was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) inhibited by dexamethasone ( 10(-7) mol/L ) , reflecting a shift of the dose-response curve .
When all the asthmatic patients were analyzed together , there was a significant correlation between the degree of sensitivity of T cells to dexamethasone and the clinical responsiveness to prednisolone ( p less than 0.01 ) .
No differences were observed between six of the sensitive and resistant patients in the clearance of plasma prednisolone derived from orally administered prednisone .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors were also characterized in five sensitive and seven resistant patients .
The numbers and binding affinities of these receptors could not account for the observed difference in the susceptibility of these cells to functional inhibition by dexamethasone in vitro .
These results suggest that clinical glucocorticoid resistance in chronic asthma does not reflect abnormal glucocorticoid clearance but may be due at least partly to a relative insensitivity of T lymphocytes to glucocorticoids .
This lack of sensitivity is unexplained but is not attributable to abnormalities of cellular glucocorticoid receptors .
NF-kB is a eukaryotic transcription regulatory factor .
In T cells and T cell lines , NF-kB is bound to a cytoplasmic proteic inhibitor , the IkB .
Treatment of T cells with mitogens ( phorbol esters ) or cytokines ( TNF alpha ) induces NF-kB nuclear translocation and the subsequent expression of NF-kB dependent T cell genes .
Here we examined the activation of NF-kB in human T cell thymic progenitors .
We report differences in (Ca2+)i requirement for NF-kB activation in thymocytes as compared to mature T cells .
Furthermore , our results indicated that thymocytes have a constitutively active form of NF-kB , suggesting that they are activated in vivo .
Several lines of evidence suggest disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) system in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
In an exploration of the potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in AD , GR density and affinity were assessed on mononuclear leukocytes of 12 AD patients and 12 healthy controls .
GR binding characteristics did not differ between patients and controls or between patients subdivided according to diagnosis or associated clinical features .
These data suggest that the abnormalities of the HPA system in AD are not related to a GR deficiency .
Transient short-term expression of the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) leads to activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-kappa B .
Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays , we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in the nucleus of Namalwa B lymphoid cells , which constitutively express Tax .
In contrast , NF-kappa B activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes .
The ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax .
However , the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors , such as Fos and Jun , was unaffected .
Thus , depending on the cellular environment , the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression can be quite different .
Consequently , one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression , as opposed to activation , of distinct signal pathways .
The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression .
Interrelations between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system ( HPA ) and the immune system represent a well-documented biological phenomenon .
While in vitro administration of glucocorticoids may inhibit concanavalin A ( Con A ) - and phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced T-cell proliferation , pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) -driven B-cell mitogenesis is relatively resistant to glucocorticoids .
To further explore the link between the HPA and the immune system in relation to glucocorticoid receptor function , dose-response curves were obtained for Con A- and PHA -induced T-cell mitogenesis , PWM-generated B-cell mitogenesis and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in 13 healthy controls .
Glucocorticoid effects were assessed in vivo by depletion of endogenous glucocorticoids after oral administration of 1.5 g metyrapone ( MET ) and subsequent glucocorticoid replacement , and in vitro by incubation of the cells with different doses of dexamethasone ( DEX ) .
There was a significant decrease in PWM-induced B-cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of DEX administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after MET treatment when compared with the DEX plus MET pretreated condition in vivo .
These data suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro is related to glucocorticoid receptor function .
The decrease in PWM-generated B-cell proliferation following cortisol depletion by MET may be seen in connection with impaired glucocorticoid-mediated induction of interleukin-1 receptor synthesis .
Glucocorticoids kill certain types of lymphoblasts , but the mechanisms are unknown .
It is clear that sufficient numbers of functional glucocorticoid receptors are required to mediate lysis , but whether they do so through the classical model of steroid hormone activation and modulation of gene expression has not been established .
In this report we have asked which region ( s ) of the steroid receptor are important for mediating lysis in leukemic T lymphoblasts .
CEM-ICR 27 leukemic lymphoblasts , a clone of CEM cells which lack functional glucocorticoid receptors and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing glutamine synthetase induction , were provided with steroid receptors by DNA transfections of various receptor gene constructs .
We measured steroid mediated lysis , receptor number and induction of glutamine synthetase in the transfected cells .
Our results provide evidence that the lysis mechanism in the ICR27 lymphoblasts is restored when functional receptor number is restored .
The DNA binding region specifying high affinity for GRE sites is required .
Lysis is mediated by any steroid that allows for activation of the receptor containing such a region .
Our data support the view that steroid-mediated cell death occurs by a process requiring direct interaction of steroid-receptor complexes with the genome .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often causes latent infection .
Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis .
The transactivator ( IE-2 ) gene of the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro .
This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes .
While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action , the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components .
Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation , with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation .
A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators .
Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element .
Interferons ( IFNs ) are well known both as antiviral proteins and as potent regulators of cell growth and differentiation .
In fact , IFNs inhibit growth of various normal and transformed cell types .
Previously , a nuclear factor , IRF-1 ( interferon regulatory factor 1 ) , which binds to type I IFN and some IFN-inducible gene promoters , was identified and cloned .
Since the IRF-1 gene is both virus and IFN inducible , an intriguing issue is raised as to whether the IRF-1 gene is functioning in IFN-mediated regulation of cell growth and differentiation .
In this study , we generated transgenic mice carrying the human IRF-1 gene linked to the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer .
In the transgenic mice , all the lymphoid tissues examined showed a dramatic reduction in the number of B lymphocytes ( B cells ) .
Preparation and analysis of bone marrow cells from the chimeric mice indicated that the bone marrow is the effective site for specific depletion of the B-cell population .
In fact , transgenic bone marrow cells cocultured with a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line revealed an altered B-cell maturation pattern .
Three molecular clones of HIV-1 , derived from a single isolate ( AL1 ) , exhibited distinct replicative and cytopathic properties during propagation in a human T cell line .
The phenotypic differences observed were attributable , in large part , to changes affecting the viral LTR .
Nucleotide sequence and PCR analyses demonstrated the presence of novel duplications or deletions involving the NF-kappa B motif .
These changes in the enhancer element were identified in the original AL1 virus stock .
Subcloning of the variant NF-kappa B segments into LTR-driven CAT expression vectors confirmed a correlation between promoter activity and replicative/cytopathic capacity .
The IL-2 and the IL-2-R alpha genes are both expressed transiently in normal T lymphocytes after Ag or mitogen activation .
In contrast , the human T cell line , IARC 301 , expresses these two genes constitutively and we have previously demonstrated that its growth depends on the autocrine production of this T cell growth factor and high affinity IL-2R .
To dissect the molecular basis for the unusual persistent expression of the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes in these IARC 301 T cells , we have analyzed the interactions of constitutively expressed nuclear proteins with the 5' flanking regions of the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes using both DNase I footprinting and gel retardation techniques .
We have found that a region in both genes ( -276 to -250 for IL-2-R alpha and -203 to -183 for IL-2 ) , which corresponds to a kappa B enhancer element , is specifically protected by nuclear proteins from IARC 301 .
In agreement with this finding , both the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha promoters are active in transient transfection assays in IARC 301 cells .
In contrast , mutation of the kappa B enhancer results in markedly attenuated activities of both promoters .
Two proteins binding the kappa B sequence , NF-kappa B and KBF1 , are constitutively expressed in IARC 301 nuclei and induced by PMA and PHA in Jurkat .
They bind to the kappa B motifs with different relative affinities that may reflect their different contribution in the expression of various promoters .
The human T cell-specific transcription factor TCF-1 alpha plays a key role in the tissue-specific activation of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) C alpha enhancer and binds to pyrimidine-rich elements ( 5'-PyCTTTG-3' ) present in a variety of other T cell-specific control regions .
Using amino acid sequence information derived from the DNA affinity-purified protein , we have now isolated cDNA clones encoding TCF-1 alpha .
The TCF-1 alpha cDNA contains a single 68-amino-acid domain that is homologous to a region conserved among high-mobility group ( HMG ) and nonhistone chromosomal proteins .
Expression of full-length and mutant cDNA clones in bacteria reveal that the single HMG motif , which is predicted to contain two extended alpha-helical segments , is sufficient to direct the sequence-specific binding of TCF-1 alpha to DNA .
Northern blot experiments demonstrate further that TCF-1 alpha mRNA is highly tissue specific , found primarily in the thymus or T cell lines .
The immature CEM T cell line expresses relatively low levels of TCF-1 alpha mRNA , which are increased upon activation of these cells by phorbol esters .
Interestingly , the cloned TCF-1 alpha protein is a potent transcriptional activator of the human TCR alpha enhancer in nonlymphoid cell lines , whereas the activity of the endogenous protein in T cell lines is strongly dependent on an additional T cell-specific protein that interacts with the core enhancer .
TCF-1 alpha is currently unique among the newly emerging family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins that share the HMG motif in that it is a highly tissue-specific RNA polymerase II transcription factor .
The interaction of the Oct2 transcription factor with the cognate octamer motif ATGCAAAT is a critical determinant of the lymphoid-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .
Ectopic expression of cloned Oct2 cDNA was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute at least some aspects of this regulation in non-lymphoid cells .
We describe the isolation and characterization of multiple cDNAs encoding mouse Oct2 from a mature B-cell line and we show that a variety of isoforms of this transcription factor is generated from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism .
All the isoforms retain the previously characterized POU-domain and are therefore able to bind to the octamer motif .
Different amounts of the various isoforms are present within the same B-cell regardless of the developmental stage of B-cell differentiation and at least some of the isoforms are conserved between mouse and humans .
In cotransfection experiments we show that all the isoforms are able to activate an octamer containing promoter element in fibroblasts revealing an unexpected functional redundancy .
Finally , we show that one of the isoforms encodes the previously described lymphoid-specific Oct2B protein which has been suggested to be involved in the function of the octamer motif in the context of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer .
A family of transcriptional activators has recently been identified in chickens ; these transcriptional activators recognize a common consensus motif ( WGATAR ) through a conserved C4 zinc finger DNA-binding domain .
One of the members of this multigene family , cGATA-3 , is most abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte cell lineage .
Analysis of human and murine GATA-3 factors shows a striking degree of amino acid sequence identity and similar patterns of tissue specificity of expression in these three organisms .
The murine and human factors are abundantly expressed in a variety of human and murine T-cell lines and can activate transcription through a tissue-specific GATA-binding site identified within the human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer .
We infer that the murine and human GATA-3 proteins play a central and highly conserved role in vertebrate T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation .
Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) differs in T lymphocytes and macrophages .
In T cells , HIV transcription is poorly detected in vivo .
Cloned , normal T lymphocytes show very little , if any , basal activity of the HIV enhancer and low nuclear expression of NF-kappa B , a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV enhancer .
In contrast , fixed tissue macrophages express detectable HIV proteins , indicating permanent virus transcription .
One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in macrophages could be sustained nuclear NF-kappa B expression .
However , the U937 monocytic cell line , which is fully permissive to HIV replication , is known to express only low levels of nuclear NF-kappa B .
We show here that chronic HIV infection results in both induction of a nuclear factor with antigenic properties indistinguishable from those of NF-kappa B and permanently increased HIV enhancer activity .
This phenomenon , which is independent of tumour necrosis factor , is associated with HIV replication , and is thus likely to explain at least in part the perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes .
The mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma has been studied by determining the rank order of potency for different corticosteroids in inhibiting the generation of a 3 kD molecule from peripheral blood monocytes isolated from corticosteroid-sensitive ( CS ) and corticosteroid-resistant ( CR ) asthmatic subjects , which augments leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) generation by human neutrophils ( PMN ) stimulated by calcium ionophore .
In addition , binding studies with ( 3H ) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant ( Kd ) and receptor numbers ( Ro ) in the monocytes of these two groups of subjects .
The concentration of corticosteroid producing 50 % inhibition ( IC50 ) was 600 nM , 70 nM , and 0.5 nM for hydrocortisone , methylprednisolone , and dexamethasone , respectively , in monocytes from CS individuals .
There was only weak inhibition of the generation of enhancing activity by the corticosteroids in the CR asthmatic individuals .
The dexamethasone Kd was 2.45 +/- 0.58 nM ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CS group and 1.6 +/- 0.35 nM ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CR group of patients ( p = 0.14 ) .
The Ro in the CS group was 3,605 +/- 984 binding sites per nucleus ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) and 4,757 +/- 692 binding sites per nucleus ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CR group ( p = 0.23 ) .
These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma can not be explained by abnormalities in corticosteroid receptor characteristics .
Cortivazol is a phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid of high potency and unusual structure .
In both wild-type and highly dexamethasone ( dex ) -resistant clones of the human leukemic cell line CEM , exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death .
It has been shown recently that in wild-type CEM cells but not in a dex-resistant , glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) -defective clone ICR-27 TK-3 , dex induces GR mRNA .
To test the hypothesis that cortivazol acts in dex-resistant cells by making use of the residual GR found there , wild-type and dex-resistant clones were treated with various concentrations of cortivazol and induction of GR mRNA was studied .
Cortivazol significantly induced GR mRNA in the normal CEM-C7 as well as in two classes of dex-resistant clones , although the dex-resistant clones needed at least 10 times more cortivazol than the normal cells for significant GR mRNA induction .
Increased levels of GR mRNA were noticed as early as 3 h after treatment .
A general correlation between induction of GR mRNA and lysis of the normal and dex-resistant cells was found .
Positive induction of GR mRNA might be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of normal and dex-resistant CEM cells , or might serve as a marker for the process .
However , the lysis pathway in the dex-resistant cells is defective in that dex-resistant clones needed significantly more cortivazol than the normal cells for lysis of the cells .
5-Aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS ) catalyzes the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway .
cDNA clones for the human erythroid ALAS isozyme were isolated from a fetal liver library .
It can be deduced that the erythroid ALAS precursor protein has a molecular weight of 64.6 kd , and is similar in size to the previously isolated human housekeeping ALAS precursor of molecular weight 70.6 kd .
The mature mitochondrial forms of the erythroid and housekeeping ALAS isozymes are predicted to have molecular weights of 59.5 kd and 64.6 kd , respectively .
The two isozymes show little amino acid identity in their N-terminal signal sequences but have considerable sequence identity in the C-terminal two-thirds of their proteins .
An analysis of the immediate promoter of the human erythroid ALAS gene revealed several putative erythroid-specific cis-acting elements including both a GATA-1 and an NF-E2 binding site .
An iron-responsive element ( IRE ) motif has been identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the human erythroid ALAS mRNA , but is not present in the housekeeping ALAS mRNA .
Gel retardation experiments established that this IRE motif formed a protein - RNA complex with cytosolic extracts from human K562 cells and this binding was strongly competed with IRE transcripts from ferritin or transferrin receptor mRNAs .
A transcript of the ALAS IRE , mutated in the conserved loop of the IRE , did not readily form this protein - RNA complex .
These results suggest that the IRE motif in the ALAS mRNA is functional and imply that translation of the mRNA is controlled by cellular iron availability during erythropoiesis .
Starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , lacking all the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites present in the native long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , proviruses containing reconstructed LTRs with individual or combinations of NF-kappa B and Sp1 elements were generated and evaluated for their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation .
Virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different human T-cell types depending on which element ( s ) was present in the LTR .
For example , in experiments involving proviral clones with LTRs containing one or two NF-kappa B elements ( and no Sp1 binding sites ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( peripheral blood lymphocytes = MT4 greater than H9 greater than CEM greater than Jurkat ) was observed .
Of note was the associated emergence of second-site LTR revertants which involved an alteration of the TATA box .
These results suggest that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different T-cell types and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of transcriptional factors present .
The interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene promoter is recognized by several cell-type-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to IL-2 production and T-cell activation .
Using a combination of transfection , protein-DNA binding , and in vitro transcription methods , we have discovered the novel T-cell-specific transcriptional activator TCF-1 ( for T-Cell Factor-1 ) , which recognizes a T-cell-specific response element ( TCE ) located within the IL-2 promoter .
Although the TCE is similar in sequence to a consensus NF kappa B site , several criteria indicate that TCF-1 is distinct from NF kappa B .
However , like NF kappa B , TCF-1 activity is induced by phorbol esters and other T-cell activators .
In this study we present evidence for reactivity of pregnancy lymphocytes , but not nonpregnancy lymphocytes , with the progesterone receptor-specific monoclonal antibody mPRI .
Using an avidin-biotin peroxidase detection system , we found a nuclear staining in 14.6 +/- 3.7 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 27 ) of pregnancy lymphocytes , while only 0.47 +/- 0.33 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 15 ) of nonpregnancy lymphocytes reacted with the antibody .
To characterize the receptor-bearing subset , CD8+ and CD4+ cells were depleted by complement-dependent lysis .
Depletion of CD8+ cells was accompanied by 62 +/- 18 % loss of progesterone receptor-bearing cells , while depletion of CD4+ cells resulted in a twofold increase in the number of positively staining lymphocytes .
In nonpregnancy lymphocytes a 3-day PHA treatment , as well as allogeneic stimulation , resulted in a significant increase in the number of receptor-containing cells .
These results suggest that pregnancy , but not nonpregnancy , lymphocytes contain progesterone binding structures , and that these are inducible by mitogenic or alloantigenic stimuli .
Activity of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers depends on a complex interplay of ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins .
Two complementary DNAs were isolated that encode proteins , denoted ITF-1 and ITF-2 , that are expressed in a variety of cell types and bind the microE5/kappa 2 motif found in both heavy and kappa light chain enhancers .
The complementary DNAs are the products of distinct genes , yet both ITF-1 and ITF-2 are structurally and functionally similar .
The two proteins interact with one another through their putative helix-loop-helix motifs and each possesses a distinct domain that dictates transcription activation .
The transcriptional enhancer located in the first intron of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region is a major determinant of B-cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .
Like other enhancers , the Ig heavy chain enhancer contains several short sequence motifs that bind specific transcription factors .
Each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer , however no single element seems absolutely required for activity .
For a better understanding of the Ig heavy chain enhancer components , we have cloned and analyzed individual sequence elements .
We find that the factor that binds to the E3 enhancer motif , CATGTGGC , is a ubiquitous transcription factor .
It is present in an active form in both B cells and non-B cells , where it can mediate transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo .
However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , the factor is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated NF-muE3 , was detected in B cells but not in non-B cells .
From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes : ( a ) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B that are not expressed in most other cell types : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif .
This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-B cells , perhaps due to a non-permissive chromatin structure of the Ig heavy chain locus .
AP-1 , the polypeptide product of c-jun , recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences and stimulates transcription of genes responsive to certain growth factors and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
We studied the effects of TPA on the regulation of c-jun gene expression in HL-60 cells during monocytic differentiation .
Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 leukemic cells , increased significantly by 6 h , and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nM TPA .
Similar kinetics of c-jun induction by TPA were observed in human U-937 and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells .
Similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 ( 10 nM ) , another activator of protein kinase C and inducer of monocytic differentiation .
Furthermore , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 0.5 microM ) , a structurally distinct agent which also induces HL-60 monocytic differentiation , increased c-jun expression .
TPA treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of c-jun transcripts .
Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription in untreated HL-60 cells , and that exposure to TPA increases this rate 3.3-fold .
Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription .
The half-life of c-jun RNA as determined by treating HL-60 cells with TPA and actinomycin D was 30 min .
In contrast , the half-life of c-jun RNA in TPA-treated HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin D was greater than 2 h .
These findings suggested that the increase in c-jun RNA observed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms .
The tissue-specific expression of the MOPC 141 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was studied by using in vitro transcription .
B-cell-specific transcription of this gene was dependent on the octamer element 5'-ATGCAAAG-3' , located in the upstream region of this promoter and in the promoters of all other immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes .
The interaction of purified octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 ( OTF1 and OTF2 ) with the MOPC 141 promoter was studied by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting .
Purified OTF1 from HeLa cells and OTF1 and OTF2 from B cells bound to identical sequences within the heavy-chain promoter .
The OTF interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5'-CTCAGGA-3' , and it seems likely that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter .
In addition to these elements , we identified a second regulatory element , the N element with the sequence 5'-GGAACCTCCCCC-3' .
The N element could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both B-cell and HeLa-cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the octamer element , it can promote high levels of transcription in B-cell extracts .
The N element bound a transcription factor , NTF , that is ubiquitous in cell-type distribution , and NTF was distinct from any of the previously described proteins that bind to similar sequences .
Based on these results , we propose that NTF and OTF2 interactions ( both with their cognate DNA elements and possibly at the protein-protein level ) may be critical to B-cell-specific expression and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating gene expression .
The treatment of human tonsillar T-lymphocytes with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , resulted in about two fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) number , without any significant change in the receptor affinity .
This increase disappeared in the presence of cycloheximide .
Alone , PMA and calcium ionophore A23187 did not affect , but together stimulated , like phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) , leucine and , in particular , thymidine incorporation .
PMA enhanced slightly the stimulatory effect of PHA .
Alone , these agents failed to alter the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on thymidine and leucine incorporation ; however , PMA-A23187 and PMA-PHA combinations appeared to antagonize the suppression by dexamethasone .
The effect of heat shock on the expression of the nuclear protooncogenes c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc was studied in human lymphoid cells .
Heat shock caused an increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels and a decrease in c-myc mRNA levels in pre-B ( Hyon ) and T ( DND-41 ) cell lines as well as in freshly isolated normal human thymocytes .
The changes in the mRNA levels of these protooncogenes in Hyon cells were most pronounced at 42 and 43 degrees C ; kinetic analysis demonstrated that the changes could be detected within 30 min of heat shock .
Altered transcription of c-fos and c-myc genes was the primary effect of heat shock .
Secondarily , heat shock of Hyon cells stabilized the c-myc mRNA level by increasing its half-life from 24 to 45 min .
The overall effect of heat shock on c-myc mRNA level , however , was a marked inhibition of its transcription .
These results demonstrate that the transcription of nuclear protooncogenes is regulated by heat shock indicating a role for nuclear protooncogenes in the stress response of lymphoid cells .
The clinical implications of nuclear T3R alterations of circulating lymphocytes in hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases were investigated .
Nuclear T3R in lymphocytes was determined by radio-ligand binding analysis .
The results showed that in hyper- and hypothyroid patients the nuclear affinity ( Ka ) for T3 was similar to that of normal subjects .
In hyperthyroidism nuclear T3 maximal binding capacity ( MBC ) was unaltered , whereas in hypothyroidism the MBC was significantly increased .
In the patients with diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure and hepatic cirrhosis , the nuclear T3R MBC of lymphocytes was about 1.5-1.6 times of the normal controls .
It was concluded that there existed hormonal regulation of nuclear T3R , and up-regulation was seen in hypothyroidism and low T3 syndrome .
Adherence is an important initial step in the transition of a circulating monocyte to a tissue macrophage .
This differentiation is accompanied by an augmented capacity to generate growth factors .
We hypothesized that adherence itself might be an important trigger for a sequence of gene activation culminating in cells with increased mRNA encoding profibrotic growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor B subunit ( PDGF[B] ) and transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) .
After in vitro adherence , human monocytes had a biphasic increase in PDGF(B) mRNA with peaks at 6 h and 13 d .
No increase in TGF-beta mRNA was observed .
The 6-h increase in PDGF(B) mRNA was adherence dependent , and in addition , was abrogated when the cytoskeletal integrity was compromised by cytochalasin D .
The 6-h increase in PDGF(B) mRNA was unaltered by adherence in the presence of the monocyte stimulus lipopolysaccharide .
Adherence to either fibronectin or collagen-coated plastic had little consistent effect on PDGF(B) mRNA accumulation .
The increased PDGF(B) mRNA observed in adherent monocytes was accompanied by increases in mRNAs of the early growth response genes c-fos ( maximal at 20 min ) , c-jun , and EGR2 ( maximal at 6-24 h ) .
The increase in c-jun and EGR2 , but not c-fos , mRNA was also abrogated by cytochalasin D .
These observations suggest that adherence results in increases of c-fos , c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF(B) mRNA .
In addition , the increases in c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF(B) may depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement .
Modulation of these events at the time of adherence offers a mechanism by which differential priming of the cells may be accomplished .
The sexual difference in the incidence of autoimmune diseases has remained an enigma for many years .
In the examination of the induction of autoimmunity in transgenic mice , evidence has been obtained further implicating the lymphokine interferon-gamma in the etiology of autoimmunity .
Sex steroid regulation of the production of this molecule , as well as other cytokines , may help explain the gender-specific differences in the immune system , including autoimmunity .
Multiple regulatory elements in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat ( HIV LTR ) are required for activation of HIV gene expression .
Previous transfection studies of HIV LTR constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that multiple regulatory regions including the enhancer , SP1 , TATA and TAR regions were important for HIV gene expression .
To characterize these regulatory elements further , mutations in these regions were inserted into both the 5' and 3' HIV LTRs and infectious proviral constructs were assembled .
These constructs were transfected into either HeLa cells , Jurkat cells or U937 cells in both the presence and absence of phorbol esters which have previously been demonstrated to activate HIV gene expression .
Viral gene expression was assayed by the level of p24 gag protein released from cultures transfected with the proviral constructs .
Results in all cell lines indicated that mutations of the SP1 , TATA and the TAR loop and stem secondary structure resulted in marked decreases in gene expression while mutations of the enhancer motif or TAR primary sequence resulted in only slight decreases .
However , viruses containing mutations in either the TAR loop sequences or stem secondary structure which were very defective for gene expression in untreated Jurkat cells , gave nearly wild-type levels of gene expression in phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells but not in phorbol ester-treated HeLa or U937 cells .
High level gene expression of these TAR mutant constructs in phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells was eliminated by second site mutations in the enhancer region or by disruption of the tat gene .

We show that in the human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line Molt4 c-myc mRNA and protein expression is down-regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore A23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration .
A block to RNA elongation is largely responsible for decreased c-myc transcription .
Although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .
The calcium ionophore-induced c-myc suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis .
Therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in c-myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .
The latter one appears to be mediated by a rapidly calcium-dependent induced gene product .
A 52-year-old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which appeared first during childhood , increased in frequency without goiter or exophthalmos .
Cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded .
The thyroid function was normal regarding T4 , free T4 and T3 , TBG , radioiodine uptake , TSH and T3 suppressibility ; however the TSH response to TRH was decreased .
The lymphocyte nuclear T3 receptor was found with an affinity close to that of normal volunteers ( Ka : 1.42 x 10(10) M-1 vs 1.95 +/- 0.35 x 10(10) M-1 ) and a binding capacity markedly increased ( 9.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.4 fmol T3 / 100 micrograms DNA ) .
Pindolol was inefficient on the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug .
Under carbimazole , the plasma T4 markedly decreased ( 27.7 +/- 3.6 nmol/l ) but the patient remained euthyroid .
The clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the heart to thyroid hormones , associated with an increased number of T3 nuclear receptor sites in lymphocytes .
A primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is lymphoid cells .
However , analysis of the viral control elements and the cellular factors that regulate adenoviral gene expression in lymphocytes has not been reported .
The adenovirus early region 3 ( ES ) gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the class I MHC antigens , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction .
To determine whether different cellular factors were involved in E3 regulation in lymphocytes as compared with HeLa cells , both DNA binding and transfection analysis with the E3 promoter in both cell types were performed .
These studies detected two novel domains referred to as L1 and L2 with a variety of lymphoid but not HeLa extracts .
Each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor NF-kappa B .
Transfections of E3 constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene revealed that mutagenesis of the distal NF-kappa B motif ( L2 ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in HeLa cells , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by lymphoid cells .
In contrast , mutagenesis of proximal NF-kappa B motif ( L1 ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both HeLa cells and lymphoid cells but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in lymphoid cells when coupled to the L2 mutation .
Reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the L1 and L2 domains indicated that the primary sequence of these motifs rather than their position in the E3 promoter was critical for regulating gene expression .

To compare extra-renal 1,25(OH)2D3 production in different types of granulomatous disease , and to identify the cell types responsible , we have evaluated the conversion of 25(OH)D3 in 1,25(OH)2D3 by uncultured cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and blood mononuclear cells from normocalcemic patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis .
1,25(OH)2D3 was produced both by lavage cells ( 12/12 tuberculosis patients , 2/6 sarcoidosis patients ) and blood mononuclear cells ( 3/5 tuberculosis patients , 0/3 sarcoidosis patients ) from patients but not controls , but significantly greater amounts were produced by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients than those of sarcoidosis patients ( P less than 0.001 ) .
1,25(OH)2D3 production by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients correlated with the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes present but not other cell types .
T lymphocytes appeared to be an important source of 1,25(OH)2D3 production , since purified T lymphocytes from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1,25(OH)2D3 , and 1,25(OH)2D3 production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated lavage cells .
Because 1,25(OH)2D3 can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria , our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte interactions , mediated at least in part by 1,25(OH)2D3 , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response .
We have previously reported that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) contain type II estrogen binding sites ( type II EBS ) .
In this study , the fluctuations of type II EBS during the menstrual cycle were analyzed in 6 normally menstruating women .
Approximately 3 times higher levels of type II EBS were found in the periovulatory period with respect to both follicular and luteal phases .
In postmenopausal women the mean type II EBS levels were similar to those observed in the follicular phase of the cycle .
However , in 3 postmenopausal patients a short course of estrogen or tamoxifen resulted in a marked increase of type II EBS levels .
Tamoxifen was also found to compete with 17 beta-estradiol for type II EBS in PBMC , although to a lesser extent than diethylstilbestrol .
The defensin sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phoP/phoQ two-component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins NP-1 and NP-2 .
Strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair ( phoP [ transcriptional activator ] or phoQ [ membrane sensor kinase ] ) had increased sensitivities to defensin .
The predicted periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with cationic proteins and that could be responsible for resistance to defensin .
Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ , we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the absence of PhoP to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product .
We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing PhoQ without PhoP were still markedly sensitive to defensins .
This implied that a pag ( phoP-activated gene ) product is responsible for defensin resistance .
We also tested for the ability of defensins NP-1 , NP-5 , and HNP-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have no effect .
Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP-PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC , as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation ( phenotype PhoPc ) , had no effect on defensin resistance , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages .
The virulence defect conferred by mutations in the phoP-phoQ two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to cationic proteins and involves the control of other proteins necessary for S. typhimurium survival within macrophages .
Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) -responsive cells blocked IL-1-induced gene transcription that was driven by the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat .
This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription , suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( HIV-1-LTR ) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but not a T cell line .
This effect appears to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from NF-kappa B in U937 and THP-1 cells .
LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV-1 production from a chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line , U1 , which produces very low levels of HIV-1 at baseline .
The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) before treatment with LPS .
This stimulation of HIV-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of HIV-1 RNA and and activation of NF-kappa B .
LPS is not able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned T cell line .
The effect of LPS on HIV-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV-1 infection .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is thought to exert its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the expression of a distinct set of lymphokine genes which are induced upon T-cell activation , among them the gene coding for interleukin-2 .
In addition , the activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is partially suppressed .
To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying suppression by CsA , we have investigated the effects of this drug on transcription factors in T cells .
Here we report that the formation of two distinct mitogen-inducible DNA-binding complexes , the kappa B complex within the HIV enhancer and the NFAT-1 complex within the interleukin-2 enhancer , is inhibited in the presence of CsA .
The kappa B-binding activity with the HIV enhancer is inhibited only if it is activated via the mitogen phytohemagglutinin whereas phorbol myristate acetate-mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug .
This suggests a model in which functionally indistinguishable kappa B complexes can be activated via two separate pathways of signal transduction distinguishable by CsA .
Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .
Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937 cell line ( U9-IIIB ) .
TNF-alpha RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9-IIIB cells .
Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of TNF-alpha RNA in U9-IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV-infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF-alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .
The effects of TNF-alpha on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and the beta interferon promoter .
In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF-alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF-kappa B-containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity .
Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF-alpha , multimers of the PRDII NF-kappa B-binding domain were inducible by both agents .
TNF-alpha was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells , but in monocytic cells , TNF-alpha did not induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity .
This level of NF-kappa B-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since TNF-alpha treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells .
However , in Jurkat cells , TNF-alpha dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV-1 through the cell population and increased viral RNA synthesis , indicating that in T cells HIV-1 multiplication was stimulated by TNF-alpha treatment .
Glucocorticoids are known to have a lytic effect in leukemic cells via interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .
Cortisol and various synthetic glucocorticoids bind to the GR with one-site kinetics .
Cortivazol ( CVZ ) is a unique , high potency synthetic glucocorticoid , which has a phenylpyrazol fused to the A-ring of the steroid nucleus and displays binding consistent with two or more sites in the cytosol from CEM C7 cells ( a human acute lymphoblastic T-cell line ) .
It has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone .
The higher affinity sites bind CVZ with 20- to 50-fold greater affinity , consistent with CVZ 's enhanced biological effects .
In mutant leukemic cells resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone , CVZ both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in CEM C7 cells .
We have carried out experiments to define the nature of the higher affinity CVZ binding site .
We now show that : 1 ) CVZ has more than one binding site in a second , independent , B-cell line , IM-9 ; 2 ) the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 is able to block both CVZ 's higher and lower affinity sites ; 3 ) all of CVZ 's binding sites are on a protein immunologically indistinguishable from the human GR ; and 4 ) freshly isolated clones of CVZ-resistant cells have lost all binding sites for CVZ .
These data indicate that CVZ is recognizing two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human GR or a protein very similar to it .
Lymphocytic levels of glucocorticoid receptors were evaluated in 114 patients suffering from Icenko-Cushing 's syndrome .
Incidence of HLA antigens was determined in 94 of them .
A significant rise of A10 and B27 antigen incidence compared to that in normal subjects allows these antigens to be considered genetic markers of Icenko-Cushing 's syndrome .
The levels of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of the patients are lower than in normal subjects both in the active stage of the disease and following bilateral total adrenalectomy .
The patients carrying B27 antigen had lymphocytic receptor concentrations under the levels of such in patients free of the antigen carriage .
Antigen B27 seems to be a cause of lower levels of glucocorticoid receptors in blood lymphocytes .
1 ) There exists a CR of GR in human leukocytes , PMN , and monocytes with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr .
The difference between them was significant statistically .
2 ) The FI of the chemotactic migration rate of PMN by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of GR .
This indicates that the CR of GR may be of functional significance .
3 ) In Cushing 's syndrome , the CR of GR was normal in spite of the fact that the CR of plasma cortisol was disturbed .
This indicates the independency of the CR of GR from that of cortisol .
4 ) In apoplexy caused by brain ischemia , the CR of GR was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex .
These results strongly suggest that the main " circadian pacemaker " of GR is located in the basal brain , most probably in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been suggested for rodents .
This study investigated whether the suppressive effect of progesterone on pregnancy lymphocytes is mediated by specific progesterone receptors .
The effects of a competitive progesterone antagonist ( RU486 ) and a specific glucocorticoid receptor blocker ( RU43044 ) were tested on the release of a blocking factor by progesterone-treated pregnancy lymphocytes .
RU 486 tested at an equal concentration as progesterone significantly inhibited the production of the blocking factor , while RU 43044 was without effect .
These data suggest that in pregnancy , lymphocyte progesterone acts on specific progesterone receptors and glucocorticoid binding sites are not involved .
Active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 24R,25 (OH)2D3 ( dioxyvit ) was used at a daily dose of 100 micrograms in treatment of children affected with tubulointerstitial disease of kidney and with chronic glomerulonephritis under conditions of kidney insufficiency .
The drug exhibited distinct normalizing effect on patterns of calcium metabolism : increase of total and ionized Ca2+ and of 25-OHD , decrease in concentration of parath hormone and osteocalcine in blood serum as well as on immunological parameters : restoration of decreased content of T- and 0-lymphocytes .
Concentration of receptors of hormonal form of 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to be minimal in lymphocytes under conditions of chronic kidney insufficiency , while their expression , after the dioxyvit action , was detected only in patients with glomerulonephritis .
Specific calcitropic effect of dioxyvit with simultaneous correction of vitamin D deficiency were apparently responsible for high efficacy of the drug in treatment of calcium metabolism and immunity impairments in children with renal deteriorations at the step of chronic kidney insufficiency .
T cell activation results in high levels of HIV replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection .
In HIV-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer , which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) .
The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus , HIV-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent NF kappa B binding site .
We demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR responds better than the HIV-2 LTR to T cell activation signals .
These qualitative differences in the response to T cell activation are reproduced not only when HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective LTR .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , NF kappa B binds to both conserved sites in the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer .
Instead of NF kappa B , the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in HIV-2 .
In conclusion , HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals , and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection .
Several new 4,19-substituted steroids and previously synthesized corticosteroids were assayed for affinity to type 1 receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes .
11 beta,19-epoxy-4,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ( 2 ) was hydrogenated with Pd-C to yield a mixture of all four dihydro derivatives 5 , accompanied by 4,21-diacetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one ( 6 ) and 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-4-hydroxypregnane-3,20-dione ( 7 ) .
With hot acetic + p-toluenesulfonic acid 5 underwent rearrangement to 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxypregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 8 ) Pd-C hydrogenation of 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregna-2,9(11)-diene-4,20-dione ( 10 ) gave 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 11 ) and the 9,11-dihydro derivative of the latter .
Treatment of 10 with warm HCl furnished 19-chloro-4,21-dihydroxypregna-4,9(11)-diene-3,20-dione (13) .
Pd-C hydrogenation of its diacetate 14 afforded the 4,5-dihydro derivative 18, 19-chloro-21-acetoxypregn-9(11)-en-20-one ( 15 ) , its 4-acetoxy derivative 16 and the 3,4-diacetoxy derivative 17 .
When tested in a radioreceptor assay in human mononuclear leukocytes the synthesized compounds showed only low relative binding affinities ( RBA ) to type 1 receptor , the highest being 0.72 % for 13 ( aldosterone = 100 % ) .
For comparison , other RBA in this system were : 19-noraldosterone , 20 % ; 18-deoxyaldosterone , 5.8 % ; 18-deoxy-19-noraldosterone , 4.7 % ; 18,21-anhydroaldosterone , 0.37 % ; 17-isoaldosterone , 7.6 % and apoaldosterone , 4.3 %
The plasma cortisol concentration and the sites of glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) in the peripheral lymphocytes were measured in 32 healthy aged persons and 13 young adults .
In animal experiment , GCR of spleen lymphocytic cell was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats .
The results showed that GCR was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level did n't change with aging .
So we think that GCR is more sensitive than the plasma cortisol level to reflect the aging change of the adrenal cortex function .
After the treatment with the regimen of Kidney-tonifying and Qi-invigorating , the GCR of the aged persons and rats was enhanced , and in this way , the function of the aged adrenal cortex was improved .
We used mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to study globin gene expression and switching in vitro .
We show that ES-derived embryoid bodies express the full complement of mouse embryonic globin genes in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation , a switch occurs to the fetal/adult genes .
In addition , the erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E1 was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of globin in embryoid bodies .
We conclude from these experiments that the ES cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development .
When the human epsilon- or beta-globin genes driven by the dominant control region ( DCR ) are introduced into this system , the human epsilon-globin gene , in contrast to the beta-globin gene , is not deregulated by the presence of the DCR and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene .
We conclude from this that the epsilon-globin gene is not regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus .
Oestrogen receptors ( ER ) are present in neoplastic lymphoid cells and have been considered a physiological marker of growth rate or differentiation .
Tamoxifen , an oestrogen antagonist , has been given in some patients with CLL and Hodgkin 's disease , with dramatic response in single cases .
Until now , ER status has been assessed using a steroid binding assay ( SBA ) which has many inherent problems .
Recently , the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against ER has been applied to the study of breast carcinomas and results obtained show good correlation with the quantitative SBA .
We studied 49 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) using immunostaining of cytospin preparations .
In 30 of these cases ER enzyme immunoassay ( ER-EIA ) was also performed .
Cultured MCF-7 cells , derived from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient , known to contain high levels of ER were used as a positive control ( 40-48 % ER positive cells by immunocytochemistry ; 200 fmol/mg protein by EIA ) .
All of the CLL cases except two ( 96 % ) were negative for ER ( less than 1 % staining ; less than 4 fmol/mg protein ) .
The two positive cases expressed granular ER staining over the nucleus ( 9.2 and 12.1 % positive cells ) and were positive by EIA and SBA .
It is concluded that ( i ) patients with CLL rarely express ER and ( ii ) immunocytochemical staining of cytospin preparations is a valid technique for the measurement of ER .
It is of interest that one of the positive cases was diagnosed as CLL with Richter 's transformation confirming earlier findings .
We have examined the binding of nuclear proteins and recombinant thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs ) to the palindromic thyroid hormone responsive element AGGTCATGACCT ( TREp ) using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Four specific protein-DNA complexes were detected after incubation of nuclear extracts ( NE ) from T3-responsive pituitary ( GH3 ) cells with a TREp-containing DNA fragment .
This was compared with the TREp binding of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized TRs .
TR alpha 1 and TR beta 2 each formed a single major TR : TREp complex which comigrated with the least retarded complex formed by GH3 NE , while TR beta 1 formed multiple complexes suggesting that it can bind to TREp as an oligomer .
Interestingly , coincubation of 35S-TR alpha 1 , GH3 NE , and unlabeled TREp resulted in not only the 35S-TR : TREp complex , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing 35S-TR alpha 1 and comigrating with those formed by GH3 extract alone .
Incubation of each of the TRs with NE from COS-7 cells , which do not possess sufficient endogenous TRs to mediate T3-responses , resulted in formation of a new , more greatly shifted complex .
A similar , heat labile activity which altered mobility of the TR : TRE complex was also present in NE from T3-unresponsive JEG-3 cells .
At high concentration of NE , all of the TR bound to TREp was more greatly retarded than in the absence of NE .
Truncation of TR alpha 1 at amino acid 210 prevented additional complex formation in the presence of NE without affecting DNA binding , suggesting that the carboxyl-terminus of the TRs is essential for interaction with nuclear proteins .

Quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids ( GCS ) were made in peripheral blood lymphocytes of bronchial asthma ( BA ) patients in consideration of GCR treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol .
It is stated that GCR of healthy controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy .
Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs GCR count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise .
Endogenous cortisol has no effect on GCR level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide .
The transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is under the control of cellular proteins that bind to the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Among the protein-binding regions of the HIV-1 LTR is the transcription-enhancer region .
We show that at least one inducible , C1 , and one constitutive , C2 , protein can bind to the HIV enhancer in Jurkat cells .
The two proteins differ in their surface charge , since they are separable by anion-exchange chromatography .
Bivalent cations such as Mg2+ and Zn2+ differentially affect their binding to oligonucleotides which contain the HIV-enhancer domain .
Both C1 and C2 proteins also bind to a similar sequence found in the interleukin-2-receptor alpha-subunit enhancer .
The inducible C1 protein was partially purified by three chromatographic steps and characterized by u.v. cross-linking as a 47 kDa protein .
All immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved octanucleotide promoter element , ATGCAAAT , which has been shown to be required for their normal B-cell-specific transcription .
Proteins that bind this octamer have been purified , and cDNAs encoding octamer-binding proteins have been cloned .
Some of these proteins ( referred to as OTF-2 ) are lymphoid specific , whereas at least one other , and possibly more ( referred to as OTF-1 ) , is found ubiquitously in all cell types .
The exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes is unclear .
We have identified two human pre-B-cell lines that contain extremely low levels of OTF-2 yet still express high levels of steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mRNA in vivo and efficiently transcribe an immunoglobulin gene in vitro .
Addition of a highly enriched preparation of OTF-1 made from one of these pre-B cells or from HeLa cells specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an immunoglobulin gene .
Furthermore , OFT-1 appeared to have approximately the same transactivation ability as OTF-2 when normalized for binding activity .
These results suggest that OTF-1 , without OTF-2 , is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that OTF-2 alone is not responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression .
Erythroid-specific genes contain binding sites for NF-E1 ( also called GF-1 and Eryf-1 ; refs 1-3 respectively ) , the principal DNA-binding protein of the erythrocytic lineage .
NF-E1 expression seems to be restricted to the erythrocytic lineage .
A closely related ( if not identical ) protein is found in both a human megakaryocytic cell line and purified human megakaryocytes ; it binds to promoter regions of two megakaryocytic-specific genes .
The binding sites and partial proteolysis profile of this protein are indistinguishable from those of the erythroid protein ; also , NF-E1 messenger RNA is the same size in both the megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines .
Furthermore , point mutations that abolish binding of NF-E1 result in a 70 % decrease in the transcriptional activity of a megakaryocytic-specific promoter .
We also find that NF-E2 , another trans-acting factor of the erythrocytic lineage , is present in megakaryocytes .
Transcriptional effects in both lineages might then be mediated in part by the same specific trans-acting factors .
Our data strengthen the idea of a close association between the erythrocytic and the megakaryocytic lineages and could also explain the expression of markers specific to the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages in most erythroblastic and megakaryoblastic permanent cell lines .
Several mutants derived from transformed human B cell lines are defective in expressing major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .
The failure to express a class II gene in at least one such mutant line has been mapped to the MHC class II X box , a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter region .
A complementary DNA encoding a DNA-binding protein ( human X box binding protein , hXBP-1 ) whose target is the human DR alpha X box and the 3' flanking region has now been cloned .
This complementary DNA encoded a protein with structural similarities to the c-jun proto-oncogene product , and its target sequence was closely related to the palindromic target sequence of c-jun .
Mutation of the hXBP-1 DNA target sequence decreased DR alpha promoter activity in vivo .
These studies suggest that the hXBP-1 protein acts as a transcription factor in B cells .
Two major protein-binding sites within the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat have been identified .
One ( site B ) contained a palindromic sequence with homology to steroid/thyroid hormone response elements but was distinct from previously described binding sites of this class .
A novel T-cell protein recognized the palindromic sequence within site B and also bound estrogen- or thyroid hormone-response elements with lower affinity .
A 7-base-pair mutation in the site B palindrome , which destroyed protein binding , resulted in increased expression from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells .
Rex , the post-transcriptional regulator of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , is known to induce accumulation of the unspliced viral gag-pol mRNA .
Rex is a phosphoprotein found in the cell nucleolus , whose function may be regulated by its localization and phosphorylation .
We have examined the role of phosphorylation on Rex function by using a protein kinase inhibitor , H-7 [ 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine ] .
Treatment of an HTLV-I infected human T-cell line with H-7 blocked specifically accumulation of the unspliced gag-pol mRNA , resulting in the decreased Gag protein synthesis that corresponds with the decreased in vivo phosphorylation of Rex .
In contrast , other viral and cellular products have not been influenced by the level of H-7 used .
Therefore , the phosphorylation of Rex is required for the viral RNA partition of HTLV-I .
Some patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( DEX ) , yet they do not have Cushingoid features .
To study whether this represents glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance , [3H]-DEX-binding assays were used to measure , in vitro , the GC receptor affinity ( 1/Kd ) and number ( Bmax ) in mononuclear leukocytes of 11 MDD patients and 15 control subjects .
No receptor abnormalities were detected in the MDD group ; thus any cellular defect leading to a lack of responsiveness to GC in the MDD patients , if present , probably lies beyond the initial receptor binding .
DEX ( 1.0 mg orally ) was administered to study in vivo GC receptor down-regulation .
Compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down-regulated Bmax after DEX .
By paired t-test , Bmax decreased significantly in the control group but not in the depressed group .
Receptor number on the control day did not correlate significantly with the degree of receptor down-regulation , severity of depression or cortisol concentrations across all the subjects .
These results do not lend support to previous reports suggesting that GC resistance in MDD results from a GC receptor-binding abnormality , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of GC-mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect ( s ) leading to GC resistance .
Random migration ( RM ) and chemotactic migration ( ChtM ) of human leukocytes to yeast activated serum were studied with the modified Boyden chamber method .
Both RM and ChtM showed circadian rhythm .
Leukocytes migrated most rapidly at night .
The difference between the peak ( 0 : 00 ) and trough values ( 8 : 00 ) of RM and ChtM was significant statistically ( P less than 0.01 ) .
ChtM was inhibited by hydrocortisone ( F ) of physiological concentration ( 10(-9)-10(-7) mol/L ) which was dose-dependent and completely antagonized by the competitive antagonist , RU38486 .
The inhibitory effect was much more evident with higher dose ( more than 10(-5) mol/L ) and it was also reversed by RU38486 , but only partially .
It is suggested that glucocorticoids ( GC ) may be a physiological regulator of the activity of leukocytes and its inhibitory action on ChtM may be involved in antiinflammatory mechanisms of GC of pharmacological doses .
The action of physiological and pharmacological concentration of GC may be mediated by low affinity specific binding sites of glucocorticoid receptors .
It has previously been shown that 9S , untransformed progestin , estrogen , androgen , and glucocorticoid receptor complexes in rabbit uterine and liver cytosols contain a 59-kDa protein [ Tai , P.K. , Maeda , Y. , Nakao , K. , Wakim , N.G. , Duhring , J.L. , & Faber , L.E. ( 1986 ) Biochemistry 25 , 5269-5275 ] .
In this work we show that the monoclonal antibody KN 382/EC1 raised against the rabbit 59-kDa protein reacts with 9S , untransformed glucocorticoid receptor complexes in cytosol prepared from human IM-9 lymphocytes but not with 4S salt-transformed receptors .
The human protein recognized by the EC1 antibody is a 56-kDa protein ( p56 ) of moderate abundance located predominantly in the cytoplasm by indirect immunofluorescence .
There are at least six isomorphs of p56 by two-dimensional gel analysis .
N-Terminal sequencing ( 20 amino acids ) shows that p56 is a unique human protein .
When p56 is immunoadsorbed from IM-9 cell cytosol , both the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins are coadsorbed in an immune-specific manner .
Neither heat shock protein reacts directly with the EC1 antibody .
We conclude that p56 exists in cytosol in a higher order complex containing hsp70 and hsp90 , both of which in turn have been found to be associated with untransformed steroid receptors .
Nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NFAT-1 ) is a transcription factor which is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation .
We have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of NFAT-1 at the single cell level in whole animals .
The system is based on the use of an oligomerized NFAT-1 binding motif that directs transcription of SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice .
This report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice .
NFAT-1 activity had previously been thought to be confined to activated T-lymphocytes upon release of intracellular calcium .
By targeting NFAT-1-dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of NFAT-1 activity .
Besides in T-lymphocytes NFAT-1 activity could also be induced in T-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and purified B-lymphocytes and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C .
A difference in the time course of appearance of NFAT-1 activity between T-lymphocytes and non-T-lymphocytes was revealed .
Constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions .
Interestingly , the tissue pattern of expression of the NFAT-1 activity resembles the expression pattern described for HIV-LTR/tat transgenic mice ( Vogel , J. , Hinrichs , S. H. , Reynolds , R. K. , Luciw , P. A. , and Jay , G. ( 1988 ) Nature 335 , 606-611 ) .
This similarity in expression and the fact that NFAT-1 has been shown to bind functional sequences in HIV-LTR suggest a role for NFAT-1 in dermal activation of the HIV-LTR .
The expression of the gene encoding the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is induced upon activation of T cells with phytohemagglutinin and active phorbolester and upon expression of tax1 , a transactivating protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I .
The same agents induce transcription from the interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain and interleukin-2 genes , depending on promoter elements that bind the inducible transcription factor NF-kappa B ( or an NF-kappa B-like factor ) .
We therefore tested the possibility that the GM-CSF gene is also regulated by a cognate motif for the NF-kappa B transcription factor .
A recent functional analysis by Miyatake et al. ( S. Miyatake , M. Seiki , M. Yoshida , and K. Arai , Mol. Cell. Biol. 8 : 5581-5587 , 1988 ) described a short promoter region in the GM-CSF gene that conferred strong inducibility by T-cell-activating signals and tax1 , but no NF-kappa B-binding motifs were identified .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we showed binding of purified human NF-kappa B and of the NF-kappa B activated in Jurkat T cells to an oligonucleotide comprising the GM-CSF promoter element responsible for mediating responsiveness to T-cell-activating signals and tax1 .
As shown by a methylation interference analysis and oligonucleotide competition experiments , purified NF-kappa B binds at positions -82 to -91 ( GGGAACTACC ) of the GM-CSF promoter sequence with an affinity similar to that with which it binds to the biologically functional kappa B motif in the beta interferon promoter ( GGGAAATTCC ) .
Two kappa B-like motifs at positions -98 to -108 of the GM-CSF promoter were also recognized but with much lower affinities .
Our data provide strong evidence that the expression of the GM-CSF gene following T-cell activation is controlled by binding of the NF-kappa B transcription factor to a high-affinity binding site in the GM-CSF promoter .
Antibodies are produced exclusively in B lymphocytes .
The expression of the antibody-encoding genes , the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes , is also restricted to B cells .
The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is present in the promoter and the enhancer of Ig genes , and plays an important role in its tissue-specific expression .
This sequence motif is a binding site for nuclear proteins , the so-called octamer transcription factors ( Oct or OTF factors ) .
The Oct-1 protein is present in all cell types analyzed so far , whereas Oct-2A and Oct-2B are found mainly in B lymphocytes .
All three proteins show the same sequence specificity and binding affinity .
It appears that the B cell-specific expression of Ig genes is mediated at least in part by cell type-specific Oct factors , and that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between Oct-1 and Oct-2 factors .
Recently , a number of other octamer factor variants were identified .
Many of these may be created by alternative splicing of a primary transcript of one Oct factor gene and may serve a specific function in the fine tuning of gene expression .
The chromosomal translocation involving 3q27 is often detected in human B-cell lymphomas , especially diffuse lymphomas with a large-cell component .
The BCL6 gene has been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint in these lymphomas .
Here we cloned the murine BCL6 ( mBCL6 ) cDNA from the muscle cDNA library using the human BCL6 ( hBCL6 ) cDNA as a probe .
The predicted amino acid sequence was 95 % identical to that of hBCL6 .
It contains six repeats of the Kruppel-like zinc-finger motif that are completely identical to those of hBCL6 , indicating that the BCL6 gene is well conserved between humans and mice .
Expression of the mBCL6 gene was ubiquitously detected in adult mouse tissues including lymphatic organs .
Furthermore , it was induced in lymphocytes activated with phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore within 30 min after stimulation .
This induction was not inhibited by treatment of the cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide .
These results suggest that BCL6 plays a role in activated lymphocytes as an immediate early gene .
Productive infection of T cells with human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) typically requires that the T cells be stimulated with antigens or mitogens .
This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B , which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to drive the HIV-1 promoter .
Recently , we have found that vigorous replication of HIV-1 takes place in nonactivated memory T cells after syncytium formation with dendritic cells ( DCs ) .
These syncytia lack activated cells as determined by an absence of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen .
The expression and activity of NF-kappa B and Sp1 were , therefore , analyzed in isolated T cells and DCs from humans and mice .
We have used immunolabeling , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays .
T cells lack active NF-kappa B but express Sp1 as expected .
DCs express high levels of all known NF-kappa B and Rel proteins , with activity residing primarily within RelB , p50 , and p65 .
However , DCs lack Sp1 , which may explain the failure of HIV-1 to replicate in purified DCs .
Coexpression of NF-kappa B and Sp1 occurs in the heterologous DC-T-cell syncytia that are induced by HIV-1 .
Therefore , HIV-1-induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription .
Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation .
The effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25(OH)2)D3 ] , a steroid hormone with immunomodulating properties , on nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) proteins was examined in in vitro activated normal human lymphocytes by Western blot analysis .
Over a 72-hr period of activation , the expression of the 50-kDa NF-kappa B , p50 , and its precursor , p105 , was increased progressively .
When cells were activated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 , the levels of the mature protein as well as its precursor were decreased .
The effect of the hormone on the levels of p50 was demonstrable in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments ; it required between 4 and 8 hr and was specific , as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were ineffective .
Besides p50 , 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the levels of another NF-kappa B protein , namely c-rel .
In addition , 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the abundance of a specific DNA-protein complex formed upon incubation of nuclear extracts from activated lymphocytes with a labeled NF-kappa B DNA binding motif .
Further , 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a construct containing four tandem repeats of the NF-kappa B binding sequence of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
These observations demonstrate directly that there is de novo synthesis of NF-kappa B during human lymphocyte activation and suggest that this process is hormonally regulated .
Males with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) have defects in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene that encodes a shared , essential component of the receptors of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 .
The Janus family tyrosine kinase Jak3 is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with gamma c , so it was hypothesized that defects in Jak3 might cause an XSCID-like phenotype .
A girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of XSCID was therefore selected for analysis .
An Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed cell line derived from her lymphocytes had normal gamma c expression but lacked Jak3 protein and had greatly diminished Jak3 messenger RNA .
Sequencing revealed a different mutation on each allele : a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frame shift and premature termination in the Jak3 JH4 domain and a nonsense mutation in the Jak3 JH2 domain .
The lack of Jak3 expression correlated with impaired B cell signaling , as demonstrated by the inability of IL-4 to activate Stat6 in the EBV-transformed cell line from the patient .
These observations indicate that the functions of gamma c are dependent on Jak3 and that Jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling .
The activation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) and STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) proteins has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several cytokines .
IL-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak 1 and Jak 3 and concomitantly , the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of multiple STAT proteins .
The STAT proteins utilized by IL-7 were identical to those induced by IL-2 and could be identified as various STAT 5 isoforms .
Moreover , the induction of both Jak 1 and 3 , and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of IL-7 , suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in IL-7-induced proliferation .
Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adolescents demonstrates resistance to tricyclic antidepressants and absence of hypercortisolemia .
The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SRIs ) is uncertain , and response predictors are unavailable .
Abnormal fast feedback and negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis implicates a dampened limbic-hippocampal glucocorticoid type II receptor ( GCII ) .
We hypothesized that lymphocyte GCII is altered in adolescent MDD and could serve as a marker for response to SRIs .
In an open-label study , adolescents ( n = 20 ) meeting DSM-III-R criteria for MDD showed baseline lymphocyte GCII sites per cell ( sites/cell ) values of 793 +/- 106 versus 2 , 563 +/- 499 ( +/- SEM ) for matched controls ( n = 18 ) ( t = 3.5 ; df = 36 ; p < .001 ) .
GCII was bimodally distributed , with SRI responders differing from nonresponders ( t = 3.9 ; df = 14 ; p < .001 ) .
GCII accurately classified 90 percent of sertraline responders and 80 percent of nonresponders .
Only SRI responders showed GCII sites/cell upregulated after 6 weeks of treatment ( t = 2.1 , df = 10 ; p < .05 ) .
Binding of plasma Factor VII/VIIa to the tissue factor ( TF ) receptor initiates the coagulation protease cascades .
TF expression by circulating monocytes is associated with thrombotic and inflammatory complications in a variety of diseases .
Transcriptional activation of the human TF gene in monocytic cells exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is mediated by binding of c-Rel /p65 heterodimers to a kappa B site in the TF promoter .
Here , we report that a family of anti-inflammatory agents , known as the salicylates , inhibited LPS induction of TF activity and TF gene transcription in human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells at clinically relevant doses .
Furthermore , sodium salicylate blocked the LPS-induced proteolytic degradation of I kappa B alpha , which prevented the nuclear translocation of c-Rel /p65 heterodimers .
In contrast , two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , ibuprofen and indomethacin , did not inhibit LPS induction of the TF gene .
These results indicated that salicylates inhibited LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells by preventing nuclear translocation of c-Rel /p65 heterodimers .
The clinical benefits of salicylates in the treatment of several diseases , including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis , may be related to their ability to reduce monocyte gene expression .
It has long been a puzzle that MHC class II molecules are expressed in human T cells after activation but not in mouse T cells ; this expression is believed to play a role in the cell mediated immune response .
Recently the MHC class II transactivator ( CIITA ) has been reported to be a major regulatory factor for both the constitutive and IFN inducible expression of MHC class II genes .
Here we show that human T cells expressing MHC class II have CIITA transcripts while MHC class II-negative human T cells and mouse T cells do not .
The expression of MHC class II genes in mouse T cells can be reconstituted upon transfection with the human CIITA cDNA .
These data indicate that the expression of CIITA explains the expression or lack of expression of MHC class II in human and mouse T cells respectively .
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is stored in the cytoplasm as an inactive form through interaction with I kappa B .
Stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha , which is presumed to be important for the subsequent degradation .
We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -dependent cell-free activation system of NF-kappa B in association with the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation .
In this study , we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , that specifically binds and phosphorylates I kappa B alpha .
LPS stimulation transiently enhanced the I kappa B alpha-bound kinase activity in THP-1 cells .
Mutational analyses of I kappa B alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha .
Moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha , blocked the LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous I kappa B alpha in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells .
These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of I kappa B alpha and subsequent dissociation of the NF-kappa B.I kappa B alpha complex .
We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) /tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) of human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) gene in THP-1 monocytic cells , and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Functional studies with IL-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha action , whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in LPS activation .
The three regions concerned are : 1 ) a region between -73 and -36 , which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-alpha ; 2 ) an element located between -181 and -73 , which appeared to regulate the response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha negatively ; and 3 ) a distal element upstream of -224 , which was inducible by IFN-gamma alone .
LPS signaling was found to involve NF kappa B activation by the p50 /p65 heterodimers .
Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha , in monocytic cells , involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter .
This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor , whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma .
We and others have previously shown that the nuclear protein , Ets-1 , is phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner after ligation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M on B lymphocytes .
As this phosphorylation was independent of protein kinase C activity , we tested whether a calcium /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaM kinase ) might phosphorylate the Ets-1 protein after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations .
The dephosphorylated form of Ets-1 has been shown to bind to chromatin , suggesting that the operative kinase should be detectable in the nucleus .
We prepared nuclear extracts from two human B cell lines in which increased intracellular free calcium levels correlated with increased phosphorylation of the Ets-1 protein .
Activity of the CaM kinases was determined using a synthetic peptide substrate both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor specific for the CaM kinase family , KN-62 .
Stimulation of cells with anti-IgM led to increased activity of a nuclear kinase that could phosphorylate the peptide , and this activity was reduced by 10 microM KN-62 .
Kinase activity was reduced in lysates preadsorbed using an antibody specific for CaM kinase II .
Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the Ets-1 protein from cells incubated with ionomycin or anti-IgM contained two unique phosphopeptides that were absent in untreated cells .
Incubation of isolated Ets-1 protein with purified CaM kinase II produced phosphorylation of peptides that migrated identically to those found in cells incubated with either anti-IgM or ionomycin .
These data suggest a model of signal transduction by the antigen receptor on B lymphocytes in which increased intracellular free calcium can rapidly activate nuclear CaM kinase II , potentially resulting in phosphorylation and regulation of DNA-binding proteins .
Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T-lymphocytes .
The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells .
Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn ( 4- and 3-fold respectively ) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins , notably phospholipase C gamma 1 .
After this event , we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration , corresponding to an influx .
This effect required surface expression of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of Jurkat cells .
In the CD45-negative variant , the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing .
Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T-lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( CD25 ) .
Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T-cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production .
Pervanadate activated NF-kappa B , as shown by an increase in DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor .
We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T-lymphocyte activation .
Moreover , induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme .
Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i .
Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin failed to increase [Ca2+]i .
Furthermore , hirudin and anti-thrombin III inhibited the thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i rise in Jurkat T cells .
A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [Ca2+]i mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca2+ release exclusively from internal stores .
Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa .
There was a good correlation between thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and Ca2+ mobilization .
Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane .
As a likely consequence of these events , thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF-kB .
Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin , whereas others such as THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL2 , a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation .
The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor mRNA .
We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response .
Finally , we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross-linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .
These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation .
CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T- and B- lymphocytes .
In myeloid cells , CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation .
Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38 .
Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells .
Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor ( RAR alpha ) .
ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line ( designated HL-60R ) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation .
Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor ( RAR alpha ) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38 .
In contrast , CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells , transfected with a functional RAR beta , RAR gamma , or RXR alpha receptor .
Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation .
Following culture with ATRA , increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells , but not on normal circulating granulocytes .
From these results , we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells .
This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells , suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells .
Lesions resulting from recurrent genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection are characterized by infiltration of CD4+ lymphocytes .
We have investigated the antigenic specificity of 47 HSV-specific CD4+ T-cell clones recovered from the HSV-2 buttock and thigh lesions of five patients .
Clones with proliferative responses to recombinant truncated glycoprotein B ( gB ) or gD of HSV-2 or purified natural gC of HSV-2 comprised a minority of the total number of HSV-specific clones isolated from lesions .
The gC2- and gD2-specific CD4+ clones had cytotoxic activity .
The approximate locations of the HSV-2 genes encoding HSV-2 type-specific CD4+ antigens have been determined by using HSV-1 x HSV-2 intertypic recombinant virus and include the approximate map regions 0.30 to 0.46 , 0.59 to 0.67 , 0.67 to 0.73 , and 0.82 to 1.0 units .
The antigenic specificity of an HLA DQ2-restricted , HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clone was mapped to amino acids 425 to 444 of VP16 of HSV-2 by sequential use of an intertypic recombinant virus containing VP16 of HSV-2 in an HSV-1 background , recombinant VP16 fusion proteins , and synthetic peptides .
Each of the remaining four patients also yielded at least one type-specific T-cell clone reactive with an HSV-2 epitope mapping to approximately 0.67 to 0.73 map units .
The antigenic specificities of lesion-derived CD4+ T-cell clones are quite diverse and include at least 10 epitopes .
Human T-cell clones reactive with gC and VP16 are reported here for the first time .
CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed specifically on monocytes and macrophages , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of monocyte differentiation .
In order to study CD14 gene regulation , the human CD14 gene was cloned from a partial EcoRI digested chromosome 5 library .
A 5.5-kilobase genomic clone contained the full-length CD14 coding sequence and 4.2 kilobases of 5'-upstream sequence .
One major and one minor transcription start site were identified 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream , respectively , from the protein translation start ATG .
A DNA fragment containing 128 bp of upstream sequence had strong , monocyte-specific promoter activity in the CD14 positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as compared to the nonmonocytic cell lines HeLa and REX .
Four regions in this DNA fragment interact with nuclear proteins isolated from monocytic cells .
The Sp1 transcription factor bound to three different regions in the CD14 promoter .
Mutation of the major Sp1 binding site ( -110 bp ) decreased tissue-specific promoter activity , and these results , together with transactivation experiments , demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells .
CD14 Sp1 site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105-kDa Sp1 species , which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non-monocytic cells , suggesting that modification of Sp1 , such as phosphorylation , may explain how the Sp1 site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity .
We have investigated the effect of redox changes in vivo on the differentiation of two human myeloid cell lines , HL-60 and KG-1 .
The glutathione-depleting agent diethyl maleate ( DEM ) prevented the development of differentiated features in response to phorbol esters , including adherence of the cells to plastic surfaces and repression of the myeloperoxidase and CD34 genes .
Moreover , DEM abolished phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and Egr-1 , suggesting that inhibition of differentiation may be due , at least in part , to redox modifications of these proteins .
During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is believed to interact with macrophage receptors , resulting in the generation of inflammatory mediators and systemic symptoms including hemodynamic instability and shock .
CD14 , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked antigen , functions as an LPS signaling receptor .
A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which CD14 , which has no transmembrane domain , transduces its signal following LPS binding .
Recently , investigators have hypothesized that CD14-mediated signaling is effected through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase ( TK ) , suggesting a multicomponent receptor model of LPS signaling .
Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -K1 cells can be activated by endotoxin to release arachidonate following transfection with human CD14 ( CHO/CD14 ) .
Nuclear translocation of cytosolic NF-kappa B is correlated with a number of LPS-inducible responses .
We sought to determine if this pathway were present in CHO/CD14 cells and to elucidate the relationship of NF-kappa B activation to the CD14 receptor system .
LPS-stimulated translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 cells resembled the same response in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 .
Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids , which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines , had no effect on translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , demonstrating that NF-kappa B translocation is an early event .
Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264.7 cells , LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated CHO/CD14 cells .
Furthermore , the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of NF-kappa B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in RAW 264.7 cells .
These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for CD14-mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS .
The cognate interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) , mediated by major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules , results in the delivery of activation signals to the APC .
These signals contribute to the expression of co-stimulatory activity by APCs and have important consequences for cell effector function .
MHC class II molecules also serve as receptors for B-cell stimulation by microbial superantigens .
In this review , Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of MHC class II signaling and analyse their role in human B-cell activation .
Studies presented here show that overall NF-kappa B signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) individually initiate signaling .
These initial pathways culminate in a common pathway through which all of the stimulating agents ultimately signal NF-kappa B activation .
We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF-kappa B activation in only one of two human T-cell lines ( Wurzburg but not Jurkat ) , whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines .
We propose the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway .
We include a redox-regulatory mechanism ( s ) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do n't activate NF-kappa B ) ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF-kappa B activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines .
Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-kappa B , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF-kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event ( s ) within the common step of the NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway .
An early biochemical event associated with T cell activation through the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) is tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates .
The exact mechanism by which IL-2 regulates transcription of different genes is presently unknown .
Here , we report that stimulation through the IL-2R induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of stat3 , a newly identified member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family of proteins .
In contrast , stat1 proteins were not tyrosine phosphorylated after IL-2 ligation , whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1 proteins ( 91 and 84 kDa proteins ) were translocated to the nucleus following interferon-gamma treatment of HeLa cells .
Apart from stat3 , another cytoplasmic protein was tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently translocated to the nucleus in response to IL-2 .
This protein had an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa and was not recognized by stat3 or stat1 mAb or antisera .
Since IL-2 induced nuclear translocation of the 84 kDa protein and stat3 followed identical kinetics , p84 is a candidate for a new , yet undefined , member of the STAT family .
Taken together , we report that IL-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of stat3 and an as yet undefined 84-kDa protein in antigen-specific human T cell lines .
We identified I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 as an immediate-early gene in human monocytes that is expressed in response to a variety of signals , including adhesion , lipopolysaccharide , and phorbol myristate acetate .
Within 5 min of monocyte adhesion , the level of the I kappa B alpha protein is markedly diminished but is rapidly replaced in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner within 20 min .
Accompanying the rapid turnover of the I kappa B alpha protein is simultaneous translocation of NF-kappa B-related transcription factors to nuclei of adhered monocytes .
The demonstration that NF-kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady-state I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF-kappa B-dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene .
Nuclear run-on analyses indicated that , instead , while several immediate-early cytokine genes , such as the interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) gene , were transcriptionally activated during monocyte adhesion , the rate of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription remained constant .
The adherence-dependent increase in I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels was also not a consequence of mRNA stabilization events .
Interestingly , while increases in both IL-1 beta and I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes , cytoplasmic levels of IL-1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA did not .
Taken together , our data suggest that two interactive mechanisms regulate monocytic I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels .
We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing ( or decay ) of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA , thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription .
Moreover , since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription , we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA are maintained by a translation-dependent degradation mechanism .
BACKGROUND : The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L .
Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) was hardly affected .
Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription , since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF .
As a functional consequence , adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation .
These effects of aspirin were not related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity , since indomethacin was ineffective .
CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization , induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin .
1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20 % , respectively in monocytes .
2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes .
3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of ER gene to approximately 50 % in monocytes in a run-on assay .
4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene , which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes .
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism .
This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the CD19 gene in a human B lymphocyte cell line .
Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of CD19 mRNA by 67 % in the IM-9 cell line .
Using a gel mobility shift assay , we identified a DNA-binding complex in IM-9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the Ah receptor .
In addition , the Ah receptor complex recognized a DNA binding site for B cell lineage-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) in the promoter region of the human CD19 gene which is similar to the consensus Ah receptor DNA binding site .
These results suggest that the AhR could interfere with BSAP-stimulated CD19 gene transcription by competition for a common DNA binding site .
The CD4 coreceptor interacts with non-polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and contributes to T cell activation .
We have investigated the effect of CD4 triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) which recognize different CD4 epitopes .
We demonstrate that CD4 triggering delivers signals capable of activating the NF-AT transcription factor which is required for interleukin-2 gene expression .
Whereas different anti-CD4 mAb or HIV-1 gp120 could all trigger activation of the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein , which mediates signals to Ras , they differed significantly in their ability to activate NF-AT .
Lack of full activation of NF-AT could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore .
The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the Ras/protein kinase C and calcium pathways .
Endothelial cells stimulated by LPS express E-selectin , which plays an important role in mediating neutrophil adhesion during inflammation .
E-selectin is induced within 1-2 h , peaks at 4-6 h , and gradually returns to basal level by 24 h .
rBPI21 , a recombinant N-terminal fragment of human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein ( BPI ) , inhibited LPS-induced E-selectin expression when added at the same time as , and up to 6 h after , LPS .
Delayed administration of rBPI21 also affected LPS-mediated activation of the nuclear factor , NF-kappa B .
Two to 4 h following LPS addition to endothelial cells , when NF-kappa B was already activated , addition of rBPI21 resulted in marked reduction of NF-kappa B detectable at 4 or 6 h .
These results indicate that endothelial activation requires continuous presence of LPS , and rBPI21 acts to reverse LPS-mediated endothelial activation by interrupting the on-going LPS signal .
IL-10 affects monocytes and T cells by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte-mediated effects predominate .
In this report , we show that in monocytes and T cells IL-10 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription , STAT1 alpha and STAT3 , in a differential manner such that the relative formation of homo- and heterodimers varies between the two cell types .
Moreover , monocytes express a novel IL-10-stimulated STAT protein with an M(r) of 70 kDa that is recognized by the anti-STAT3 Ab but is not observed in T cells .
IL-10 treatment of both T cells and monocytes results in the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 , but not Jak2 or Jak3 .
Selective modulation of immune responsiveness by IL-10 in cells such as monocytes and T cells may result in part from the differential activation of STAT protein pairs .
We have earlier shown that stimulation of human CD4+ T cells with SEA presented on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -DR transfectants coexpressing either B7 or LFA-3 resulted in distinct cytokine profiles .
We now demonstrate that B7 , but not LFA-3 , strongly costimulated IL-2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells .
Maximal increase in IL-2 transcription was recorded with CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 , suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA-3 at the transcriptional level .
Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of CD4+ T cells with CHO-DR and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of NF-kappa B binding proteins , whereas induction of AP-1 binding proteins required costimulation .
LFA-3 induced moderate levels of AP-1 , but did not influence the levels of NF-kappa B , while B7 costimulation strongly induced both AP-1 and substantially enhanced NF-kappa B binding proteins .
The CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 triple transfectant induced a further increase in AP-1 and NF-kappa B binding proteins compared with the double transfectants .
The level of Oct-1 binding proteins remained similar in all samples .
Super-shift analysis revealed that the NF-kappa B complex of costimulated CD4+ T cells contained large amounts of p50 , substantial amounts of p65 , and marginal levels of c-Rel proteins .
The AP-1 binding proteins contained c-Jun , Jun-D , and Fra-1 , but marginal amounts of Jun-B and c-Fos .
Our results indicate distinct effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on the activity of AP-1 and NF-kappa B .
These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on IL-2 expression .
One of the most important cytokines involved in immune response regulation is interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , a potent activator of the proliferation and function of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells .
The mechanisms by which the effects of IL-2 are propagated within cells are not understood .
While the binding of IL-2 to its receptor was recently shown to lead to the activation of two kinases , Jak-1 and Jak-3 , subsequent steps in the signaling pathway to the nucleus that lead to the activation of specific genes had not been characterized .
Since many cytokines that activate Jak kinases also lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of members of the Stat family of transcription factors , the ability of IL-2 to trigger Stat phosphorylation was examined .
Exposure of activated human T lymphocytes or of a natural killer cell line ( NKL ) to IL-2 leads to the phosphorylation of Stat1 alpha , Stat1 beta , and Stat3 , as well as of two Stat-related proteins , p94 and p95 .
p94 and p95 share homology with Stat1 at the phosphorylation site and in the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain , but otherwise are immunologically distinct from Stat1 .
These Stat proteins were found to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to a specific DNA sequence .
These findings suggest a mechanism by which IL-2 binding to its receptor may activate specific genes involved in immune cell function .
OBJECTIVE : Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is of vital importance during critical illness .
We have studied the adaptive mechanisms which occur at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor in glucocorticoid target tissues in patients with sepsis or septic shock .
DESIGN : The effects of hypercortisolaemia , hyperthermia and cellular composition on number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell and their affinity were evaluated , both in vitro and in vivo , in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes of control subjects and in patients with sepsis or septic shock .
SUBJECTS : Fifteen patients ( age 25-79 ) with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an intensive care unit were studied .
The control group consisted of 24 healthy laboratory employees .
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured and compared to clinical data and the plasma cortisol concentrations .
RESULTS : Hypercortisolaemia , in vitro , resulted in a decreased affinity and a decreased binding capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor .
In vitro , hyperthermia as well as variations in the cellular composition did not influence the glucocorticoid receptor .
In vivo , there was no change in the number of receptors per cell in patients with sepsis or septic shock as compared to healthy controls .
However , a decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor was observed .
There was a weak but significant negative correlation between body temperature and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the patient group .
There was no relation between circulating cortisol concentrations and glucocorticoid receptor affinity and number .
CONCLUSIONS : There is no obvious regulation of the number of glucocorticoid receptors by plasma cortisol concentrations in vivo .
The decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor together with the negative correlation between hyperthermia and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with sepsis or septic shock suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation during critical illness is accompanied by peripheral adaptation in glucocorticoid receptor number and affinity .
Although evidence indicates that dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) exerts direct physiological effects , its mechanism of action remains unknown .
DHEA binding sites were examined using a whole-cell binding assay in a human T lymphoid cell line , PEER , revealing that a single class of high-affinity binding sites for DHEA ( dissociation constant = 7.4 +/- 0.53 nmol/L , mean +/- SE , n = 4 ) was greatly increased when treated with DHEA , phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate , and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 .
Bound [3H]DHEA was displaced sensitively by DHEA and secondarily by dihydrotestosterone , but not effectively by other steroids , including DHEA sulfate .
These results not only indicate the existence of a DHEA receptor , but also suggest that T cells become susceptible to regulation by DHEA during the process of signal-induced activation .
Avian cells express three heat shock transcription factor ( HSF ) genes corresponding to a novel factor , HSF3 , and homologs of mouse and human HSF1 and HSF2 .
Analysis of the biochemical and cell biological properties of these HSFs reveals that HSF3 has properties in common with both HSF1 and HSF2 and yet has features which are distinct from both .
HSF3 is constitutively expressed in the erythroblast cell line HD6 , the lymphoblast cell line MSB , and embryo fibroblasts , and yet its DNA-binding activity is induced only upon exposure of HD6 cells to heat shock .
Acquisition of HSF3 DNA-binding activity in HD6 cells is accompanied by oligomerization from a non-DNA-binding dimer to a DNA-binding trimer , whereas the effect of heat shock on HSF1 is oligomerization of an inert monomer to a DNA-binding trimer .
Induction of HSF3 DNA-binding activity is delayed compared with that of HSF1 .
As occurs for HSF1 , heat shock leads to the translocation of HSF3 to the nucleus .
HSF exhibits the properties of a transcriptional activator , as judged from the stimulatory activity of transiently overexpressed HSF3 measured by using a heat shock element-containing reporter construct and as independently assayed by the activity of a chimeric GAL4-HSF3 protein on a GAL4 reporter construct .
These results reveal that HSF3 is negatively regulated in avian cells and acquires DNA-binding activity in certain cells upon heat shock .
Locus control regions ( LCRs ) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors .
A 2.3-kb LCR in the human adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) gene first intron , which controls expression in thymocytes , is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin .
Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements .
We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site .
In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells , c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences .
c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures .
Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression .
Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes .
Within the context of a complex enhancer and LCR , c-Myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site .
T-lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25(OH)2D3 ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA levels .
We report here that 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant , suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D3 receptor ( VDR ) .
We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter /reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding .
We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in vivo to a short 40-bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , NF-AT-1 , which is bound by a T-cell-specific transcription factor , NFATp , as well as by AP-1 .
VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress IL-2 expression .
These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression .
By combining partially purified proteins in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound NFATp /AP-1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor .
Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp /AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element .
This direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of transcriptional activators of the IL-2 gene may provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents .
Growth factor receptors play an important role in hematopoiesis .
In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis , we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) receptor alpha gene .
Here , we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells , which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR .
The GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs .
We show that the myeloid and B cell transcription factor PU.1 binds specifically to this site .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that a CCAAT site located upstream of the PU.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity .
C/EBP alpha is the major CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of U937 cells .
Point mutations of either the PU.1 site or the C/EBP site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts , PU.1 forms a novel , specific , more slowly migrating complex ( PU-SF ) when binding the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter PU.1 site .
This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with PU.1 on a myeloid PU.1 binding site .
The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of PU.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do not express PU.1 , including T cells and epithelial cells , but not from erythroid cells .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that the PU-SF complex binds to PU.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters , and its formation requires an intact PU.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region .
Expression of PU.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter .
Deletion of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 results in a failure to form the PU-SF complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation , suggesting that formation of the PU-SF complex is of functional importance for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter .
Finally , we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha can also active the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter in nonmyeloid cells .

Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I ( Fc gamma RI ) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma .
Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression .
Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma .
Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis , which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site without a TATA box .
Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site ( -7 to +13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element ( GIRE ) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site .
A 17-bp sequence between positions -51 and -35 conferred IFN-gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .
Double-stranded GIRE sequence , but not a scrambled sequence , was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma treated U937 cells .
Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells .
The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes .
Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter .
Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .
They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear .
Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in mice and cultured cells .
This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .
Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids .
The earliest lesion in the development of an atherosclerotic plaque is the fatty streak .
This chronic inflammatory reaction results from a sequence of events that begins with the trapping of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) in the subendothelial space of the artery wall .
The trapped LDL is seeded with oxidative species released by the overlying endothelium , and lipid oxidation is initiated within the LDL particle .
Some of the lipids that result lead to the activation of NFkB-like transcription factors that cause the expression of genes whose protein products mediate monocyte binding , monocyte chemotaxis into the subendothelial space , and conversion into macrophages .
At least 1 major gene modulates the oxidation of LDL lipids and/or the biologic response to these lipids .
The inverse relation between high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and atherosclerotic events may in part be due to enzymes associated with HDL that destroy the biologically active lipids generated in LDL .
Expression of nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase , which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential .
However , the relationship remains controversial according to the tumor cell types and experimental system , with conflicting results from different research groups .
In order to determine whether NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer , we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunohistochemistry .
The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC .
However , the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant .
And there was no statistically significant difference in NDP kinase expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC without metastasis .
Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer .
The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined .
The induction of cytokine expression in monocytes/macrophages by bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a critical , highly regulated host defence response .
The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , referred to as priming , is well established .
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which priming occurs is poorly defined .
Using tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes .
Priming by IFN-gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation .
IFN-gamma pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response .
Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF , but not M-CSF .
Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS .
The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in nuclear factor-kappa B activity in these cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a consensus NF-kappa B oligonucleotide .
An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells ( T1/2 increased 6-8-fold ) .
Consistent with the increased mRNA stability , the duration of mRNA accumulation was longer following LPS stimulation in primed monocytes , in addition to being of greater magnitude .
Finally , primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89 .
H-89 substantially suppressed LPS-induced TNF mRNA accumulation in unprimed cells , but had no effect on primed monocytes following LPS stimulation .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
MZF-1 is a C2H2 zinc finger gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of myeloid differentiation .
The MZF-1 protein contains 13 C2H2 zinc fingers arranged in bipartite DNA binding domains containing zinc fingers through 4 and , in the carboxy-terminus , 5 through 13 .
We previously identified the DNA consensus binding site recognized by the two DNA binding domains .
To assess the transcription regulatory function of MZF-1 , the full-length MZF-1 coding region was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator GAL4 .
The expression vector was cotransfected with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene regulated by the thymidine kinase promoter containing GAL4 DNA binding sites into NIH 3T3 , 293 , K562 , and Jurkat cell lines .
MZF-1 represses CAT reporter gene expression via GAL4 binding sites in the nonhematopoietic cell lines NIH 3T3 and 293 .
In contrast , MZF-1 activates CAT reporter gene expression in the hematopoietic cell lines K562 and Jurkat .
The MZF-1 binding sites are present in the promoters of several genes expressed during myeloid differentiation , including the CD34 promoter .
MZF-1 transcriptional regulation of this physiologically relevant promoter was assessed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines .
Recombinant MZF-1 protein specifically binds to the consensus binding sites in the CD34 promoter in mobility shift assays .
MZF-1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids regulated by the CD34 promoter into both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines .
As with the heterologous DNA binding domain , MZF-1 represses reporter gene expression in nonhematopoietic cell lines and activates expression in hematopoietic cell lines .
Activation of CD34 expression in hematopoietic cell lines is dependent on the presence of intact MZF-1 binding sites .
The cell type-specific regulation of the CD34 promoter by MZF-1 suggests the presence of tissue-specific regulators/adapters or differential MZF-1 modifications that determine MZF-1 transcriptional regulatory function .
The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor could account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy .
The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the receptor-cDNA .
The receptor concentration , as measured by staining and steroid binding test , varied considerably but showed no clear correlation to clinical response .
Using a highly sensitive mutation screening assay of the DNA- and the steroid-binding region , none of the treated patients revealed any mutation , suggesting that the glucocorticoid receptor in the CLL patients tested is not altered in these domains .
In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele .
The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy .
This conclusion is discussed in relation to the mechanism of corticoid resistance in mouse and human lymphoma cells in culture .
The cell surface receptors for PRL and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) are structurally distinct , but share regulatory tasks in T lymphocytes .
They can stimulate proliferation and activate transcription of over-lapping sets of genes of T cells .
PRL and IL-2 receptor activation are both linked to the Jak/Stat ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway .
We investigated the ability of PRL and IL-2 to activate Stat proteins in different T cell lines .
The DNA binding specificities , the reactivities toward Stat-specific antisera , and the mol wt of IL-2- and PRL-induced DNA-binding proteins in Nb2 and C196 T cell lines were investigated .
A comparison with the Stat proteins induced by interferon-gamma , PRL , and IL-6 in T47D mammary tumor cells was made .
We found that these parameters were indistinguishable for one of the PRL- and IL-2-induced factors .
A transcription factor closely related to mammary gland factor-Stat5 is rapidly activated upon interaction of IL-2 and PRL with their respective receptors .
Activation of a second protein related to Stat1 was also observed .
Our results emphasize the role of PRL as a regulator of the immune response and indicate that the Stat factors mammary gland factor-Stat5 and Stat1 play a role in the regulation of gene expression during T cell development .
CD30 is a recently described member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily .
In this report , we show that following incubation of L540 cells ( Hodgkin 's disease-derived , T cell-like , CD30+ cells ) with the agonistic anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) M44 and M67 , two nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B DNA binding activities were induced in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel retardation assays .
The effect of the mAb towards NF-kappa B activation was rapid , as it occurred within 20 min , and was sustained for up to 6 h .
By comparison , an isotype-matched antibody had no effect on NF-kappa B activation .
Moreover , in human T helper ( Th ) clones functionally characterized as being of the type 0 , type 1 and type 2 ( 28 % , < 1 % und 93 % CD30+ , respectively ) , the extent of CD30-mediated NF-kappa B activation correlated with the proportion of CD30+ cells .
In all cell lines investigated , the NF-kappa B complexes induced following CD30 engagement were shown to contain p50 NF-kappa B1 , p65 RelA , and possibly other transcription factors .
Collectively , our results demonstrate that nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappa B rank among the short-term cellular responses elicited following CD30 ligation .
Whereas the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been described , the bacterial ligands required are poorly understood .
To identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK lacking pili , flagella , and the RpoN sigma factor were undertaken .
The RpoN mutant , lacking pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both macrophages and neutrophils .
Pili were not absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa .
The presence of a flagellum was not required for binding of P. aeruginosa to macrophages but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , suggesting that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis .
The immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) intronic enhancer stimulates transcription from functional promoters in B lymphocytes but not other cell types .
The observation that binding sites for the nuclear factor-mu negative regulator ( NF-muNR ) enhancer repressor overlap nuclear matrix attachment regions ( MARs ) in this enhancer has lead to the hypothesis that the cell type specificity of the enhancer might be controlled by regulating nuclear matrix attachment ( Scheuermann , R. H. , and Chen , U. ( 1989 ) Genes & Dev. 3 , 1255-1266 ) .
To understand the role of MARs in IgH enhancer regulation , we have identified a novel MAR-binding protein , MAR-BP1 , from soluble nuclear matrix preparations based on its ability to bind to the MARs associated with the IgH enhancer .
Purified MAR-BP1 migrates as a 33-kDa protein , and it can be found in nuclear matrix preparations from a number of different types of lymphoid cell lines .
Although specific binding sites have been difficult to localize by chemical or enzymatic footprinting procedures , NF-muNR binding sites are critical for efficient MAR-BP1 binding .
Indeed , binding of the IgH enhancer to either intact nuclear matrix preparations or to MAR-BP1 is mutually exclusive to NF-muNR binding .
These results are consistent with a model for cell-type specific regulation in which binding of the NF-muNR repressor to the IgH enhancer prevents nuclear matrix attachment in inappropriate cells by interfering with MAR-BP1/enhancer interaction .
The T cell activation is initiated by interaction of specific Ags with TCR , followed by activation of intracellular biochemical events leading to activation of several genes .
The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins in a primary TCR-mediated activation of T cells have been explored .
In purified human peripheral blood T cells , nuclear STAT proteins were activated approximately 3 h after activation by cross-linked anti-CD3 Abs .
These STAT proteins were detected by using the IFN-gamma-activated sequence ( GAS ) and related oligonucleotides as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Analysis of the nuclear extracts with anti-STAT Abs indicated that they contained STAT-3 and additional proteins crossreactive with the STAT family .
The induction of STAT activity was inhibited completely by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or cyclosporin A , thus indicating that the induction was due to a secondary factor produced by the activated T cells .
As neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs effectively down-regulated the early induction of STAT proteins and as exogenously added IL-6 rapidly activated DNA binding similar to TCR-mediated bindings , it can be concluded that IL-6 is the factor responsible for the activation of STAT proteins in a primary T cell response .
Positive regulatory element I ( PRE-I ) is a strong enhancer element essential for expression of the human IL-4 gene .
To identify transcription factors binding to PRE-I , we screened a cDNA expression library from Jurkat T cells and isolated a cDNA encoding nuclear factor ( NF ) -IL6 ( also known as C/EBP beta ) .
NF-IL6 mRNA was found in human Jurkat T cells and in the mouse Th2 clone D10 , but not in Th1 clone 29 .
rNF-IL6 expressed in bacteria was shown to specifically bind to PRE-I .
PRE-I forms multiple DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells .
Some of these complexes were demonstrated to contain NF-IL6 by using anti-C/EBP beta Abs .
Overexpression of NF-IL6 enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene linked to the PRE-I-thymidine kinase or the human IL-4 promoter more than 10-fold in Jurkat cells .
Promoter deletion studies revealed two additional NF-IL6 binding sites located at positions -44 to -36 ( C/EBP proximal ) and -87 to -79 ( C/EBP medial ) , respectively .
Our results demonstrate that NF-IL6 is involved in transcriptional activation of the human IL-4 promoter in T cells .
Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ) .
HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent growth ; over time , by an unknown mechanism , the cells become IL-2-independent .
Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL-2 , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells .
In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes , the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated Jak-STAT pathway , which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -infected cells may sustain three distinct forms of virus latency .
In lymphoblastoid cell lines , six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , -LP ) , three latent membrane proteins ( LMP1 , 2A , 2B ) , and two nuclear RNAs ( EBERs ) are expressed .
This form of latency , termed latency III , is also encountered in some posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders .
In EBV-positive cases of Hodgkin 's disease , the EBERs , EBNA1 , and the LMPs are expressed ( latency II ) , whereas in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) only the EBERs and EBNA1 have been detected ( latency I ) .
We have studied the expression of EBV proteins in 17 cases of EBV-positive endemic BL by immunohistology .
Expression of LMP1 was seen in variable proportions of tumor cells in two cases and EBNA2 was detected in some tumor cells in three other cases .
Also , the BZLF1 trans-activator protein was expressed in a few tumor cells in 6 cases , indicating entry into the lytic cycle .
A phenotypic drift from latency I to latency III has been observed previously in some BL cell lines .
Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in BL in vivo and indicate that the operational definition of EBV latencies is not easily applied to human tumors .
Almost 25 % of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene .
Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele .
Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T-ALL .
In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do not display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration .
A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T-ALL cells .
Monoallelic expression of TAL1 was observed in the leukemic cells of all patients ( 8 of 8 ) bearing a TAL1 gene rearrangement .
In the leukemic cells of patients without detectable TAL1 rearrangements , TAL1 transcription occurred in either a monoallelic ( 3 of 7 patients ) or a biallelic ( 4 of 7 patients ) fashion .
Thus , TAL1 activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis-acting regulatory sequences ( affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele ) or changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles ) .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa .
HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .
Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 .
Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine-rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .
We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri-kappa B .
This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T-cell lines .
This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity , and no comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1 .
While a nuclear factor ( s ) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site , electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells , thus supporting the transfection data .
Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .
Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri-kappa B factor may ultimately provide insight into the different role monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis .
We recently identified a differentiation inhibitory factor ( I-factor ) in mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells as a murine homolog of the human nm23-H2 gene product .
nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes , although their mechanisms of action are still unknown .
Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase activity , it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins .
In the present experiment , we examined the effect of nm23 proteins on various differentiation induction systems of human leukemic cells including HL-60 , U937 , HEL/S , KU812F , K562 , and HEL cells .
Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL , KU812 and K562 cells , but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 , U937 and HEL/S cells .
The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23-H1 , -H2 , mouse nm23-M1 , and -M2 proteins .
Moreover , both the mutant nm23-H2His protein and truncated nm23-H2 protein containing N-terminal ( 1-60 ) peptide , which do not have NDP kinase activity , also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells .
These results suggest that ( 1 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I-factor/nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells , ( 2 ) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity , and ( 3 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23/NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides .
We have shown that the interaction of interleukin ( IL ) -5 with the receptor activates Lyn tyrosine kinase within 1 min and Jak2 tyrosine kinase within 1-3 min .
IL-5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21ras .
The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of Raf-1 , MEK , and MAP kinases as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ .
Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins .
The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a gamma activation site ( GAS ) probe .
We found that IL-5 induces two GAS-binding proteins in eosinophils , one of which is STAT1 .
We conclude that IL-5 induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways : ( 1 ) Lyn --> Ras --> Raf-1 --> MEK --> MAP kinase and ( 2 ) Jak2 --> STAT1 .
Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells .
Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad-infected targets .
The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells .
This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells suggests that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A-immortalized cells that may emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host .
Activation of NF-kappa B by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor , I kappa B alpha , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear .
In the present study , the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated .
Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( approximately 1-5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP-1 ) and type 2A ( PP-2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the absence of any cellular stimulus .
This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer , is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Furthermore , the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells , but not that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells , is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers .
However , induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha .
We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor .
Together , these results suggest that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha , mediated through both the TNF-alpha-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases , may serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome-mediated degradation .
The major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II genes encode cell surface proteins that bind antigenic peptide for presentation to T-cells .
The class II proteins are expressed constitutively on B-cells and EBV-transformed B-cells , and are inducible by IFN-gamma on a wide variety of cell types .
Retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) is a tumor suppressor and functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding and inactivating the transactivator E2F-I .
RB-defective tumor lines are non-inducible for MHC class II by IFN-gamma , or very weakly inducible , but transfection of 2 different lines with RB expression vectors re-establishes or substantially enhances class II inducibility .
Therefore , we examined the RB status of a series of B-cell mutants that are defective in class II expression , generated either in vitro or derived from Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome ( BLS ) patients .
Nuclear matrix-bound RB was detectable in all cases , indicating that loss of RB is not responsible for decreased class II expression in these lines .
A second E2F-I binding protein , most likely DP-I , was also apparently normal in both class II-positive and -negative B-cell lines .
We also examined the IFN-gamma induction of CIITA in RB-defective lines .
CIITA is a class II gene transactivator known to be defective in one form of BLS and to be required for the induction of MHC class II by IFN-gamma .
CIITA mRNA is normally inducible by IFN-gamma in class II non-inducible , RB-defective lines , and in one line , re-expression of RB has no effect on CIITA mRNA induction levels .
Thus , the block in MHC class II inducibility in RB-defective cells is not due to a block in CIITA inducibility .
The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules , such as the tumor-suppressor protein pRb , the G1 cyclins , the cyclin-dependent kinases , and their inhibitors .
These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals , such as that provided by TGF-beta .
Here , we show that the presence of either wild-type EBV or its transforming latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) results in the loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in human B cells .
Chemical cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF-beta receptor profile in EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the TGF-beta 1-mediated modulation of junB gene expression .
However , TGF-beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV ( or LMP-1 ) -positive cells as opposed to EBV -negative cells , suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses .
Furthermore , LMP-1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2 ; normal B cells or EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells do not express D-type cyclins .
Taken together , these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP-1 can lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation .
The human granulocyte-macrophage CSF ( GM-CSF ) gene is expressed in T cells in response to TCR activation that can be mimicked by treatment of the cells with PMA and Ca2+ ionophore .
The gene contains a proximal functional promoter region ( -620 to +34 ) , as well as a powerful enhancer located 3 kb upstream , both of which are involved in the response of the gene to TCR activation .
The proximal promoter contains a region termed CLEO ( -54 to -31 ) that consists of a purine-rich element abutting an activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) -like site , as well as an upstream nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) site ( -85 to -76 ) and a CK-1 element ( -101 to -92 ) .
We show in this work that mutations in either the purine-rich region of the CLEO element or the NF-kappa B site result in reduced PMA/Ca2+ activation of a 620-bp human GM-CSF promoter- luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat T cells by 65 % and 50 % , respectively .
The major inducible protein complex that binds to the human CLEO ( hCLEO ) element is an AP-1-like complex that is inducible by PMA alone , but shows increased binding in response to PMA together with Ca2+ ionophore .
Although the binding of this complex is not cyclosporin-sensitive , promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment .
A second weak inducible complex resembling nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) was also observed binding to the hCLEO region .
By using recombinant proteins , we confirmed that AP-1 , NF-ATp , and a higher order NF-ATp /AP-1 complex could all form with the hCLEO element , and we have also defined the sequence requirements for binding of each of these complexes .
We found that expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin could substitute for Ca2+ ionophore and synergize with PMA to activate the GM-CSF promoter , and conversely that mutant-activated Ras could substitute for PMA and cooperate with Ca2+ ionophore .
Co-expression of Ras and calcineurin , however , did not activate the GM-CSF promoter , but required the additional expression of NF-kappa B p65 .
These results imply that at least three signals are required to activate the GM-CSF proximal promoter , and that the signals impinge on distinct transcription factors that bind to the hCLEO and NF-kappa B regions of the promoter .
Three binding sites for C/EBP proteins are found in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( V.M. Tesmer , A.Rajadhyaksha , J.Babin , and M.Bina , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 90 : 7298-7302 , 1993 ) .
We have determined the functional role of C/EBP proteins and C/EBP sites in regulating transcription from the HIV- 1 LTR in monocytes/macrophages .
Inhibition of endogenous C/EBP proteins , using either an excess of C/EBP binding sites or a trans- dominant negative inhibitor , demonstrated that C/EBP proteins are required for basal and activated levels of HIV-1 LTR transcription in the promonocytic cell line U937 .
Northern ( RNA ) blots and binding assays showed that NF-IL6 is the only known C/EBP family member which is increased when U937 cells are activated .
Mutational analyses of the HIV-1 LTR showed that one C/EBP site is required for normal LTR transcription both before and after cellular activation and that the two 3' C/EBP sites are functionally equivalent .
However , transcription from crippled HIV-1 LTRs lacking C/EBP sites can still be induced following activation of U937 cells .
Several models are suggested for how elevated NF-IL6 may participate in an autostimulatory loop involving HIV infection , macrophage activation , cytokine expression , and HIV replication .
We previously have demonstrated a requirement for oxidative events during cell cycle entry in T lymphocytes and have hypothesised that reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular signalling agents during lymphocyte activation .
In the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .
Treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes with cysteamine in vitro was found to inhibit proliferation in a dose-dependent manner , with essentially complete inhibition occurring at a dose of 400 microM .
This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time-frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .
It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .
Taking the IL-2 gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappa B , NF-AT and Oct1 , whose functions are required for expression of the IL-2 mRNA .
Cysteamine treatment inhibited both expression of the IL-2 mRNA and secretion of IL-2 into the culture medium .
The inhibitory effect of cysteamine may be mediated at least in part by an effect on transcription factor function , as the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and NF-kappa B extracted from mitogen-stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment .
Interestingly , Oct1 and NF-AT DNA binding activity were not affected by cysteamine treatment , suggesting that oxidative signalling processes operate in a selective manner .
The identification of regulatory proteins , such as transcription factors , as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the G0 to G1 phase transition in T lymphocytes .
Hydroxyurea ( HU ) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation .
In addition , HU stimulates the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia patients .
To further understand its mechanism of action , we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of c-jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells .
HU induced a dose-dependent stimulation of c-jun synthesis .
The levels of c-jun mRNA was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by HU within 2 h .
This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h .
Both nuclear run-on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates c-jun mRNA expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c-jun mRNA .
In addition , the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in HU treated cells .
Furthermore , concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X AP-1/CAT activity .
These results strongly suggest that HU induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of c-jun during erythroid differentiation .
Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and cell proliferation .
In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression .
Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase .
Our data suggest that lipoxygenase metabolites activate ROI formation which then induce IL-2 expression via NF-kappa B activation .
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) in response to different extracellular signals .
In particular , two interleukins ( ILs ) , IL-2 and IL-12 , have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN-gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL .
Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN-gamma in response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation , there has as yet been no report of a natural killer ( NK ) cell line that responds in a similar manner .
In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3.3 derived from human NK cells , responds to both IL-2 and IL-12 , as measured by increases in IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression .
In addition , when used together IL-2 and IL-12 synergized in the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF and this synergy was attributed to an increased accumulation and stability of the IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNAs .
To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the gene induction , five inhibitors , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , transforming growth factor-beta , cycloheximide , genistein , and staurosporine A , were used in analyzing the effects of IL-2 and IL-12 on NK3.3 cells .
The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C , but not new protein synthesis , is required for IL-2 induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF cytoplasmic mRNA .
In contrast , IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma cytoplasmic mRNA appears to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C .
Furthermore , both transforming growth factor-beta and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress IL-2 and IL-12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive .
It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation .
In addition , IL-2 but not IL-12 induced nuclear factors NF-kappa B and AP1 , and regulation of the nuclear levels of these two DNA binding protein complexes is correlated with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression .
These data indicate that IL-2 and IL-12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression , and that the NK3.3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways .
Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells .
Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ; however , it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when Tat is absent .
It is possible that Tat is also needed for other functions during HIV replication .
To test these hypotheses , we studied several tat mutants , including two stop codon mutants and one deletion mutant using replication-competent HIV-1 constructs carrying wild-type or mutant LTRs with modifications in the NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites .
In this study , we show that Tat- HIV-1 with wild-type LTRs can replicate in HeLa cells , and the virus produced from HeLa cells can infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages .
It was found that the propagation of the Tat mutants containing wild-type LTRs was less efficient than that of the LTR-modified Tat mutants .
Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs .
However , this efficient propagation of the LTR-modified tat mutants was restricted to some lymphoid cell lines that have been transformed with other viruses .
Thus , despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block , Tat is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full-length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles .
Direct sequencing of the viral genomes and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild-type reversion even after prolonged infection with the Tat- virus .
The implications for in vivo HIV-1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative Tat function are discussed .
Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia ( M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .
To clarify properties of the blast cells in M7 and TMD cases , we examined erythroid markers expression in blasts from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study .
Erythroid-specific mRNAs encoding gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase were found to be expressed in blasts from most of these cases , indicating that majorities of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .
We also found that mRNAs encoding GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in all these cases .
These results suggest that M7 blasts and TMD blasts correspond to the erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells .
Although the interrelationship between the two messengers Ca2+ and cyclic AMP in platelet function is well documented , its mechanism of action still remains to be established .
We investigated here the question of the regulation of platelet Ca(2+)-ATPases by cyclic AMP through the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein using a pathological model .
We first found experimental conditions where Ca(2+)-transport by platelet membrane vesicles appeared to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein .
Then , we studied platelets of patients with congestive heart failure for their expression of the potential 97 kDa Ca(2+)-ATPase target of regulation through the Rap1 protein as well as the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein using the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase ( C. Sub. ) .
In the first patients studied , we found no significant modification in the expression of the 97 kDa Ca(2+)-ATPase by Western blotting using the PL/IM 430 monoclonal antibody which specifically recognized this isoform .
In contrast , the Rap1 protein was differentially phosphorylated when using 15 micrograms/ml of the C. Sub .
These results allowed us to use these pathological platelets to study the relationship between the expression of Rap1 protein and the regulation of Ca2+ transport by selecting a patient with severe heart failure .
We could show a decrease in the expression as well as in the phosphorylation of Rap1 protein and demonstrate a lower effect of C. Sub. on Ca2+ transport .
Finally , by studying a further series of patients , we could confirm that the decrease in Rap1 protein expression in heart failure , whatever its extent , was variable , and could strictly correlate the expression of Rap1 protein with the stimulatory effect of C. Sub. on Ca2+ transport .
Besides the evidence for regulation of the expression of the Rap1 protein in platelets from patients with heart failure , these findings constitute a new approach in favour of the regulation of platelet Ca2+ transport through the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein .
Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 ( LEF-1 ) is a regulatory high mobility group ( HMG ) protein that activates the T cell receptor alpha ( TCR alpha ) enhancer in a context-restricted manner in T cells .
In this paper we demonstrate that the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer , which contains DNA-binding sites for LEF-1 and Ets-1 , also provides a functional context for activation by LEF-1 .
First , we show that mutations in the LEF-1-binding site inhibit the activity of multimerized copies of the HIV-1 enhancer in Jurkat T cells , and that LEF-1/GAL4 can activate a GAL4-substituted HIV-1 enhancer 80- to 100-fold in vivo .
Second , recombinant LEF-1 is shown to activate HIV-1 transcription on chromatin-assembled DNA in vitro .
By using a nucleosome-assembly system derived from Drosophila embryos , we find that the packaging of DNA into chromatin in vitro strongly represses HIV-1 transcription and that repression can be counteracted efficiently by preincubation of the DNA with LEF-1 ( or LEF-1 and Ets-1 ) supplemented with fractions containing the promoter-binding protein , Sp1 .
Addition of TFE-3 , which binds to an E-box motif upstream of the LEF-1 and Ets-1 sites , further augments transcription in this system .
Individually or collectively , none of the three enhancer-binding proteins ( LEF-1 , Ets-1 , and TFE-3 ) could activate transcription in the absence of Sp1 .
A truncation mutant of LEF-1 ( HMG-88 ) , which contains the HMG box but lacks the trans-activation domain , did not activate transcription from nucleosomal DNA , indicating that bending of DNA by the HMG domain is not sufficient to activate transcription in vitro .
We conclude that transcription activation by LEF-1 in vitro is a chromatin-dependent process that requires a functional trans-activation domain in addition to the HMG domain .
HTLV-1 infection causes an adult T cell leukemia in humans .
The viral encoded protein tax , is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis .
Our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but not thymocytes , despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues .
Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kD protein ( s ) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast B line and in HTLV-1 transformed human lymphoid lines , but not in thymocytes from Thy-tax transgenic mice .
Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with a set of Jak kinase specific antibodies , identified p130 as Jak2 in the tax transformed mouse fibroblastic cell line and Jak3 in HTLV-1 transformed human T cell lines .
Phosphorylation of Jak2 in tax transformed cells resulted from high expression of IL-6 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could also be induced in Balb/c3T3 cells using a supernatant from the B line , which was associated with induction of cell proliferation .
Both phosphorylation and proliferation were inhibited by IL-6 neutralizing antibodies .
Constitutive phosphorylation of Jak kinases may facilitate tumor growth in both HTLV-1 infected human T cells and the transgenic mouse model .
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) , the primary regulator of the production of erythroid cells , acts by binding to a cell surface receptor ( EpoR ) on erythroid progenitors .
We used deletion analysis and transfection assays with reporter gene constructs to examine the transcription control elements in the 5' flanking region of the human EpoR gene .
In erythroid cells most of the transcription activity was contained in a 150 bp promoter fragment with binding sites for transcription factors AP2 , Sp1 and the erythroid-specific GATA-1 .
The 150 bp hEpoR promoter exhibited high and low activity in erythroid OCIM1 and K562 cells , respectively , reflecting the high and low levels of constitutive hEpoR expression .
The GATA-1 and Sp1 binding sites in this promoter lacking a TATA sequence were necessary for a high level of transcription activation .
Protein-DNA binding studies suggested that Sp1 and two other CCGCCC binding proteins from erythroid and non-erythroid cells could bind to the Sp1 binding motif .
By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection , we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells , but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells , although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562 .
Interestingly , when we mutated the Sp1 site , resulting in a marked decrease in hEpoR promoter activity , we could restore transactivation by increasing GATA-1 levels in OCIM1 cells .
These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter , the level of hEpoR gene expression does not depend on GATA-1 alone .
Rather , hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA-1 with other cell-specific factors , including possibly other Sp1-like binding proteins , to provide high level , tissue-specific expression .
The mRNA for the Duffy blood group antigen , the erythrocyte receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed chemokine receptor .
Here , we show that the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene ( DARC ) is composed of a single exon and that most Duffy-negative blacks carry a silent FY*B allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -46 .
This mutation impairs the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor .
With the recent characterization of the FY*A and FY*B alleles , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid-specific repression of the DARC gene in Duffy-negative individuals .
The regulation of interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene expression has been investigated mainly in T lymphocytes , the predominant producers of IL-2 .
However , B cells can also synthesize IL-2 .
In the present study we analyzed the control of IL-2 promoter activity in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed B cell clones which are capable of secreting IL-2 at a low level after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin .
Transient transfections using reporter constructs with multiples of transcription factor binding sites from the IL-2 promoter [ distal nuclear factor ( NF ) -AT , proximal NF-AT , AP-1/Octamer ( UPS ) or NF-chi B ( TCEd ) sites ] were performed .
In EBV-transformed B clones , the chi B site exerted the strongest inducible activity ; the NF-AT binding sites showed either no or only weak activity compared to Jurkat T cells .
An IL-2 promoter bearing a defective NF-chi B site was completely inactive in EBV-transformed B cells , while it still had activity in Jurkat T cells .
In seven EBV-B cell clones or lines differing in their capacity to secrete IL-2 , the activity of the IL-2 promoter correlated well with the status of IL-2 secretion .
Similarly , a human immunodeficiency virus promoter , whose activity is controlled through chi B factors , was found to be active in the IL-2 producing EBV-B cells , but inactive in the non-IL-2-producing cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from EBV-B cells and the IL-2 NF-chi B probe revealed the constitutive generation of chi B complexes in IL-2-secreting cells consisting mainly of heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes .
A weaker chi B complex formation and faster-migrating complexes were detected in non-IL-2-secreting cells .
These results demonstrate that the IL-2 NF-chi B site is indispensable for the activity of the IL-2 promoter in EBV-transformed B cells , whereas other transcription factors appear to be less important for IL-2 expression in these cells .
The genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol-VDR complex , the role of microtubules in the response to 1,25(OH)2D3 has not been studied in viable cells .
Our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .
Monocytes convert 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25(OH)2D3 .
Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity , without affecting either total 1,25(OH)2D3 uptake or maximal 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR binding .
Thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent modulation of gene transcription .
Interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis , not by decreasing the Vmax of monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase but through an increase in the Km for 25(OH)2D3 .
We examined 25(OH)D3 transport .
Microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25(OH)D3 uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .
Thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25(OH)D3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis .
We have isolated cDNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response ( MyD ) genes , activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis following induction for differentiation along either the macrophage or granulocyte lineage in human myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells .
One cDNA clone of a primary response gene , expressed upon macrophage differentiation , encoded for Egr-1 , a zinc finger transcription factor .
The Egr-1 gene was observed to be transcriptionally silent in HL-60 cells , but active in U-937 and M1 cells , the latter two being predetermined for macrophage differentiation .
Egr-1 antisense oligomers in the culture media blocked macrophage differentiation in both myeloid leukemia cell lines and normal myeloblasts .
HL-60 cells constitutively expressing an Egr-1 transgene ( HL-60Egr-1 ) could be induced for macrophage , but not granulocyte , differentiation .
These observations indicate that expression of Egr-1 is essential for and restricts differentiation of myeloblasts along the macrophage lineage .
Tal-1 rearrangements are associated with nearly 30 % of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
Tal-1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix domain and is known to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells .
We investigated the pattern of tal-1 expression in purified human hematopoietic cells by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis .
Both methods demonstrated that the tal-1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in basophilic granulocytes .
In addition , our results indicate that the tal-1 1A promoter , which contains two consensus GATA-binding sites , is active mainly in these lineages .
Because the GATA-1 gene is known to transactivate several genes specific for the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic/basophilic lineages , we studied GATA-1 expression in these purified hematopoietic cells .
We found that GATA-1 and tal-1 genes are coexpressed in these three lineages .
Remarkably , the expression of both genes is downmodulated during erythroid and megakaryocytic terminal maturation .
In immature hematopoietic cells , tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells ( CD34+/CD38(2+) ) , whereas they are not detectable in the most primitive cells ( CD34(2+)/CD38- ) .
In contrast , GATA-2 is strongly expressed in both most primitive and committed progenitors cells , whereas GATA-3 is mostly detected in most primitive ones .
Altogether our results strongly suggest that GATA-1 modulates the transcription of tal-1 during the differentiation of the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and basosophilic lineages .
The CD20 ( B1 ) gene encodes a B cell-specific protein involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation .
Studies with 5' deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs have previously revealed two regions of the promoter between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained positive regulatory elements .
In this study we identified a sequence element present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201 , TTCTTCTAATTAA , which is important in the high constitutive expression of CD20 in mature B cells and the induction of CD20 in pre-B cells .
This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells .
Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site .
Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter , the BAT box , and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter revealed that all three sequences bound the same nuclear proteins suggesting that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25-fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10-fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence .
Despite this lower affinity , a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct-2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells .
The BAT box and Oct-2 were also implicated in the induction of CD20 in the pre-B cell line , PB-697 , via phorbol esters .
The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct-2 mRNA and a BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT construct , in contrast to the wild type , was poorly induced by phorbol esters .
Together these results suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21 .
Infection of target cells with cytopathic viruses inhibits IFN induction of cytolytic resistance to NK cell-mediated cytolysis [ IFN-mediated cytoprotection ( IFN-MCP ) ] .
It has been thought that the virally induced inhibition of IFN-MCP is secondary to the shutdown of cellular macromolecular synthesis that accompanies cytopathic virus infections .
Group C , adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) infection inhibits both IFN-MCP and cellular protein synthesis .
This study determined if the Ad5-induced inhibition of IFN-MCP was independent of adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and secondary only to the expression of the Ad early region 1A gene ( E1A ) .
To test this hypothesis , 4-h NK cytolysis assays were performed on IFN-gamma-treated human cells infected with an Ad5 E1A deletion mutant , dl343 , or transfected with the Ad5 E1A gene .
IFN-MCP was not inhibited by infection with dl343 , despite the production of large amounts of both early ( E1B , p55 ) and late ( hexon ) Ad proteins .
In contrast to E1A-negative , parental cell lines , IFN-MCP was blocked in Ad5 E1A-transfected epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines .
Genetic mapping studies within the E1A gene demonstrated that expression of only the first exon of E1A was sufficient to inhibit IFN-MCP .
DNA sequence homology of E1A genes between different Ad groups ( group A , Ad12 ; group C , Ad5 ) is limited almost entirely to three conserved regions located within the first exon of E1A .
Because IFN-MCP was also blocked in Ad12 E1A-transfected cell lines , expression of one or more of the E1A-conserved regions may be necessary to inhibit IFN-MCP .
In summary , the expression of E1A gene products inhibited IFN-MCP independently of virus infection .
E1A 's inhibition of IFN-MCP has the net effect of promoting the selective NK cell-mediated clearance of Ad-infected or Ad-transformed human cells .
Cytokines , the peptide hormones which control the homeostasis of the immune system and also play a fundamental role in inflammatory and immune mediated reactions , have been involved at multiple levels in the pathogenesis of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) has been shown to induce production of several cytokines both in vitro and in vivo .
Conversely , several cytokines modulate the levels of HIV expression in infected cells of both T lymphocytic and mononuclear phagocytic lineage .
Activated mononuclear cells , particularly B cells which are in a state of chronic activation in HIV infected individuals , release HIV-inductive cytokines and thus play a potentially important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection .
The protooncogene p21ras , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events .
Here , we report that nitric oxide ( NO ) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras .
In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible .
Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange .
The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as NF-kappa B activation , and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell .
These studies identify p21ras as a target of the same cell .
These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors .
Monocyte-macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) .
We examined mRNA levels of various V-ATPase subunits during differentiation of both native monocytes and the cell line THP-1 , and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell V-ATPase content .
From nuclear runoff experiments , we found that one subunit in particular , the B2 isoform ( Mr = 56,000 ) , was amplified primarily by transcriptional means .
We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region .
Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5'-flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA-less promoter with a high G + C content .
Primer extension and ribonuclease protection analyses indicate a single major transcriptional start site .
We transfected promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into THP-1 cells to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation .
We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP-1 differentiation .
DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple AP2 and Sp1 binding sites in the 5'-untranslated and proximal coding regions .
A human T lymphoid cell line , PEER , dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore .
A new gene , TINUR , was cloned from apoptotic PEER cells .
The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross-linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex .
TINUR belongs to the NGFI-B/nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor .
TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI-B/nur77 .
We also propose that the NGFI-B/nur77 family can be classified into two subtypes .
Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells .
This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand , starting at 30 min after stimulation .
The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in kappa B binding activity .
These functions of PAF appeared to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors , as two PAF receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659 , 989 , blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity induced by PAF .
The antagonists , however , had no effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity .
Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF , whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect .
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor for NF-kappa B activation , markedly reduced PAF-stimulated kappa B binding activity as well as up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA .
These results suggest a potential role of PAF in HB-EGF expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased kappa B binding activity .
Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) - and TCR-initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes .
In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL-1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF-kappa B .
The synergistic antigen receptor initiated signals are mediated through protein kinase C because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , but not with calcium ionophores ; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant .
Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF-kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL-1 rather than by antigen receptor signals .
Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF-kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) -NF-kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation .
The IL-1-induced NF-kappa B DNA nuclear localization is transient and can be prolonged either by an antigen receptor-initiated signal or by inhibiting protein synthesis .
These results suggest that IL-1 induces both NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for terminating NF-kappa B-DNA interaction in the nucleus .
Antigen receptor signals prolong NF-kappa B-DNA interaction , probably by functionally antagonizing the IL-1-induced synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for the transient NF-kappa B-DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance IL-1-induced NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcription .
A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL-2 .
Following T cell activation , the genes encoding IL-2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced .
In turn , secreted IL-2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes .
Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by IL-2 .
Following this lead , we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL-2 .
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL-2-inducible DNA binding activities .
Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line , termed YT .
We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL-2-inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin-induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue .
We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated hStat5 , helps govern the biological effects of IL-2 during the immune response .
To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy , we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL , and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL .
IL-7 and IL-15 induced the same complexes as IL-2 , a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins .
IL-13 Induced the same complexes as IL-4 , a finding explained by our studies implicating IL-4R as a shared component of the receptors .
These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions , and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein .
Aspirin-like drugs ( ALD ) induce calcium mobilization , an essential component of T cell activation , but do not induce the biosynthesis of IL-2 .
To understand the extent to which ALD may mimic mitogenic stimulation , we studied cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling steps in ALD-treated T cells .
We found that ALD induce a transient activation of protein kinase ( PKC ) but have no effect ( in comparison to anti-CD3 antibodies ) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation .
ALD-induced calcium mobilization and PKC activation are independent of tyrosine protein kinase activity as shown by the lack of effect of herbimycin , a tyrosine-protein kinase-specific inhibitor .
Although we detected no IL-2 mRNA in ALD-treated cells , the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three regulatory sequences in the IL-2 promoter region : NFAT , NF kappa B , and AP-1 .
These binding activities are expressed only in activated T cells .
The expression of AP-1 depended on calcium mobilization and PKC activation .
These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD .
The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA-binding activity by several transcription factors .
However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation .
Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha-like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS-40 .
Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that HS-40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner .
We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS-40 by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures .
Three of these HS-40 enhancer motifs , 5'NF-E2/AP1 , GT II , and GATA-1(c) , positively regulate the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha-globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells .
On the other hand , the 3'NF-E2/AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor .
Mutation in the GATA-1(d) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS-40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells .
These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS-40 motifs .
The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of human alpha-like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo .
Our previous studies in human monocytes have demonstrated that interleukin ( IL ) -10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines , IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha by blocking gene transcription .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , we now show that , in monocytes stimulated with LPS or TNF alpha , IL-10 inhibits nuclear stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , a transcription factor involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes .
Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , GR , CREB , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10 .
This selective inhibition by IL-10 of NF kappa B activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with IL-10 's cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness .
Furthermore , compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit NF kappa B activation block cytokine gene transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes .
Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of NF kappa B activation may be an important mechanism for IL-10 suppression of cytokine gene transcription in human monocytes .
IL-4 , another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF kappa B activation .
Further examination reveals that , unlike IL-10 , IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription .
These data indicate that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms .
T cells express multiple isotypes of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and although it is well accepted that PKCs have an important role in T cell activation , little is known about the function of individual PKC isotypes .
To address this issue , mutationally active PKC-alpha , -epsilon , or -zeta have been transfected into T cells and the consequences for T cell activation determined .
p21ras plays an essential role in T cell activation .
Accordingly , the effects of the constitutively active PKCs were compared to the effects of mutationally activated p21ras .
The data indicate that PKC-epsilon and , to a lesser extent PKC-alpha but not -zeta , can regulate the transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT-1 ) .
The ability of PKC-epsilon to induce transactivation of NF-AT-1 and AP-1 was similar to the stimulatory effect of a constitutively activated p21ras .
PKC-epsilon , but not PKC-alpha nor activated p21ras , was able to induce NF-KB activity .
Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect .
Activated Src and p21ras were able to induce CD69 expression .
These results indicate selective functions for different PKC isotypes in T cells .
Moreover , the data comparing the effects of activated Ras and PKC mutants suggest that PKC-alpha , p21ras , and PKC-epsilon are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway .
A previously unrecognized element , located downstream of the start site of transcription in the first exon of the DR alpha gene , has been defined that enhances promoter activity up to eightfold in a position-dependent manner .
Mutations in this DNA-binding site abolished binding of a nuclear factor in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the DR alpha promoter to a basal level .
Significant sequence homology of this element was found in the DNA of the DR beta , DP alpha and -beta , and DQ alpha genes , always located downstream of the transcriptional start site .
The nuclear factor binds to the DR alpha and DP alpha element but not to the element in the DQ alpha gene .
It was identified as NF-E1 ( YY1 ) .
This protein , previously identified by its binding to the Ig kappa 3' enhancer and the Ig heavy chain mu E1 site , thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression .
The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth .
The nuclear activity of NF-kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha .
This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF-kappa B-inducing agents , including T-cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .
To explore these I kappa B alpha-dependent mechanisms for NF-kappa B induction , we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes .
Specifically , removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm .
However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells .
Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction , including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors .
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect , a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Together , these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in I kappa B alpha that coordinately controls the biologic activities of I kappa B alpha and NF-kappa B in response to viral and immune stimuli .
Stimulation of human CD4+ T-cell clones through the T-cell receptor ( TcR ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long-lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy .
During the induction of anergy , T cells are phenotypically similar to cells responding to an immunogenic stimulus .
The amount of TcR at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the CD2 and CD25 receptors are increased .
When restimulated , however , anergic T cells fail to up-regulate transcription of the IL-2 gene and in consequence do not produce IL-2 .
In this study , we have compared the ability of various transcription factors to bind to their appropriate site on DNA .
Factors were isolated from the nuclei of T cells that were in the induction phase of anergy or were undergoing activation .
The pattern of binding activity in restimulated T cells is consistent with the pattern that has previously been shown to regulate T-cell-specific expression of the IL-2 and the beta chain of the TcR genes .
The measured binding to a TCF-1 site is the same in the nuclei of resting , activated , and anergized cells .
The inducible factors NK-kappa B , beta E2 , CD28RC , and AP-1 are not expressed in resting cells and are twofold lower in anergized as compared with activated cells .
In contrast , anergic T cells express approximately eightfold lower amounts of NF-AT , a member of the class of inducible factors that regulates IL-2 gene transcription .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
The IE2 gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few viral regulatory proteins expressed immediately upon infection of the host cell .
It is a potent transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters .
We found that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product ( Rb ) dramatically suppressed this IE2 transactivation of various promoters .
However , unlike another tumor suppressor protein , p53 , Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , suggesting that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 rather than other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery .
We found by protein-affinity chromatography that Rb in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to IE2 .
Our results suggest that Rb may regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population .
Furthermore , these data may provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the possible involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis .
Type II major histocompatibility complex combined immune deficiency ( type II MHC CID or bare lymphocyte syndrome ) is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by absent MHC class II expression .
Four distinct complementation groups have been identified .
Recently , the defective gene in group II type II MHC CID has been isolated and termed CIITA .
Here , we demonstrate that CIITA is an MHC class II gene-specific transcription activator .
The transcription activation function is provided by the N-terminal acidic domain ( amino acids 26-137 ) , which is experimentally exchangeable with a heterologous viral transcription-activating domain .
The specificity of CIITA for three major MHC class II genes , DR , DQ and DP , is mediated by its remaining C-terminal residues ( amino acids 317-1130 ) .
The transactivation of multiple cis elements , especially S and X2 , of the DR alpha proximal promoter in group II CID cells is CIITA dependent .
Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did not increase class II expression , we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on-off switch , while availability of downstream interactor ( s ) limits transcription .
Transcriptional control of steroid-regulated gene networks by nuclear receptor proteins results in the coordinate expression of a limited number of target genes .
Although much is known about the structure and function of steroid receptors , relatively few cell-specific steroid-regulated genes have been isolated and characterized .
In this paper we describe results using mRNA differential display reverse transcriptase PCR ( DDPCR ) to identify and isolate short cDNA sequence tags from thymocyte and prostate cells under various hormone conditions .
Using this technique we have isolated several differentially expressed sequence tags ( DESTs ) from the mouse thymocyte cell line WEHI 7.2 .
Two of these DESTs , GIG10 and GIG18 , are rapidly induced by dexamethasone within 2 h of treatment .
GIG10 is a novel sequence and GIG18 is the mouse homologue of a human expressed sequence tag isolated from activated B lymphocytes .
We also used DDPCR to isolate DESTs from androgen-modulated rat ventral prostate tissue , one of which we characterized and found to correspond to the 3' end of prostatic spermine binding protein mRNA , a known androgen-regulated gene .
Modifications of the original DDPCR protocol , which we found can potentially decrease the frequency of isolating false-positive DESTs , are described and the merits of DDPCR , relative to other differential cDNA cloning strategies , are discussed .
The inert quality of MRL-Ipr/Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4-CD8- ( CD4-8- ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL-2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation .
Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR-mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium .
They also display constitutively high levels of p59fyn and CD3 zeta tyrosine phosphorylation .
The generation of second messengers in T cells normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene .
We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL-2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4-8- T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes .
Levels of the octamer , NF-kappa B ( p50-p65 heterodimer ) , and AP-1 transcriptional factors are constitutively elevated in freshly isolated Ipr CD4-8- T cells , consistent with the activated phenotype of these cells .
Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
Yet , the levels of the activating NF-AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells .
Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4-8- T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF-AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes .
Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF-AT-binding factor is rapidly down-regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
These two abnormalities at the NF-AT site provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in IL-2 production from Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
Antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complex class I or II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells interacts with the T cell receptor ( TCR ) on the surface of T cells and initiates an activation cascade .
So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells , are also required for complete T cell activation .
High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals .
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR-like signals .
These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 gene transcription in T cells .
Costimulatory signals , such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells , lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) promoter .
This region is termed the CK-1 or CD28RE and appears to bind specific members of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors .
Human T leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infects T cells and can lead to increase GM-CSF expression .
We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein , tax , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression .
Tax activates the GM-CSF promoter through the CK-1/CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor-kappa B binding to this region .
However , other transcription factors or coactivators of NF-kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified .
The CK-1/CD28RE of GM-CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-3 gene also contains a related region .
This observation , together with the fact that both GM-CSF and IL-2 respond to TCR signals via NFAT , implies a high degree of conservation in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells .
Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 alpha ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 , LD78 , or AT464 ) are members of the -C-C family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .
Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow-derived MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation .
It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in mature cell types .
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 .
Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK-1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter .
One member , ICK-1A , behaves as a strong negative regulator .
In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , we show that the ICK-1 binding site does not confer negative regulation in U937 cells .
We provide evidence for an additional binding site , the MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) site , which overlaps the ICK-1 site .
Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .
A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .
We propose that the MNP protein ( s ) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor ( s ) expressed in hematopoietic cells .
We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
The PuF site on the silent normal c-myc allele was unoccupied .
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site .
Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site .
Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele ; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
Immunosuppression has been often associated with the course of malignant diseases .
In the present study , the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I-III breast cancer .
Whereas PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer preoperatively was significantly decreased when compared with data obtained in healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) , the degree of the defect in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs depended upon the tumour burden as manifested by tumour size and axillary lymph node involvement ( P < 0.003 in each case ) .
PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs dropped significantly in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) after an observation period of 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) , but not in patients under adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen only .
After an additional 6 months ( i.e. 12 months after surgery ) , PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0.1 ) , but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001 ) .
When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared , it was found that out of 23 patients whose PBMCs had experienced a drop in their PHA-induced proliferation , 14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( i.e. 36 months after surgery ) .
In contrast , out of 59 patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in their PHA-induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery , only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression .
We thus conclude that PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer depends upon the tumour load and is a good clinical predictor for the further course of the disease .
HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , decreased plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations and decreased intracellular glutathione levels .
We now show that a depletion of intracellular glutathione in a human T cell line ( Molt-4 ) inhibits the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas incubation with increasing extracellular concentrations of cysteine inhibits the DNA-binding and transactivating activity of NF kappa B .
Because inhibition of DNA-binding activity is associated with increasing intracellular glutathione disulfide levels and GSSG can be shown to inhibit the DNA-binding activity directly in cell-free systems , our studies suggest that GSSG is a physiologically relevant inhibitor in intact cells also .
NF kappa B controls many immunologically important genes , so our studies suggest that the immune system may be sensitive not only against a cysteine and glutathione deficiency but also against an excess of cysteine .
Estrogen exhibits a variety of actions , including immuno-modulatory effects , in vivo and in vitro .
The mechanism by which estrogen exerts its anti-inflammatory effect is not yet understood .
We investigated the possible mechanisms of estradiol acting via the polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , which are important in the immune response .
The agent , 17 beta-estradiol , but not 17 alpha-estradiol , significantly reduced PMNs chemotaxis to FMLP in a dose-dependent manner ( control vs estrogen 10(-10)-(-6) M , P < 0.05 ) .
Physiological concentrations of estradiol significantly reduced the chemotaxis of PMNs ( 10(-10) mol ) .
Pre-incubation with clomiphene or tamoxifen which are estrogen receptor antagonists , eliminated the inhibitory effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the chemotaxis of PMNs , restoring it to the control level .
These observations suggest that 17 beta-estradiol suppressed the chemotaxis of PMNs by a receptor-dependent mechanism .
In addition , the level of estradiol in human plasma , which PMNs were drawn , showed a close , inverse correlation with the PMNs chemotaxis to FMLP ( r = -0.821 p < 0.001 ) .
Estrogen may modify the activity of neutrophils during the normal menstrual cycle , not only during pregnancy , and influence inflammation .
The human platelet-activating factor receptor ( PAFR ) gene is transcribed by two distinct promoters ( promoter 1 and promoter 2 ) to generate two transcripts ( designated as PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 ) , though their open reading frames are identical .
By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts , we found that the levels of PAFR transcript 1 ( leukocyte-type ) , but not PAFR transcript 2 ( tissue-type ) , are upregulated by PAF as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) in the human stomach cancer cell line ( JR-St cells ) which expresses both functional PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 endogenously .
Functional analysis of the promoter 1 with a transient expression assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene as a reporter showed that both PAF and TPA activated the promoter 1 but not the deleted promoter lacking the three consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B located from -571 bp to -459 bp .
These findings suggest a molecular mechanism of positive regulation of PAFR gene expression by PAF through NF-kappa B , possibly by a phosphorylation reaction involving protein kinase C by PAF .
The number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) in peripheral leukocytes was determined by radioligand-binding assay in extrinsic and intrinsic asthmatics .
Their corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed .
The results showed that the average number of GCR in asthmatics was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0.01 ) , and there was a linear correlation between the number of GCR and the course of asthma .
Besides , there was also a linear correlation between the number of GCR and the age of the initial attack of asthma .
No difference in plasma cortisol level was found between asthmatics and healthy subjects .
These findings suggest that there is no primary and general impairment of glucocorticoid metabolism in the asthmatics , but the number of GCR in the asthmatics is lower than that in healthy controls .
The decrease of the number of GCR in asthmatics , we think , is related to heredity and repeated attacks of asthma .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of mature , resting B cells drives them to become lymphoblasts expressing high levels of cell surface molecules , such as CD48 , characteristically expressed on normal activated B cells .
Here , we report on the identification of an enhancer element in the CD48 gene which reproducibly confers strong transcriptional activity only in EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines .
The element is not activated upon infection of established EBV-negative B-cell lines , indicating that EBV fails to drive these cells to a fully lymphoblastoid phenotype .
An NF-kappa B binding site is an essential component of the element but alone is not sufficient to account for the activity or the specificity of the element .
We have detected a specific nuclear protein complex that binds to the element and show that NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) is a part of this complex .
The EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 is capable of transactivating the isolated CD48 NF-kappa B site but not the intact element , suggesting that the latent membrane protein 1-driven activation of NF-kappa B/Rel must interact with other regulatory pathways to control expression of cellular genes as EBV drives resting B cells into the cell cycle .
The intracellular dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin and functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor .
It contains a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) motif contiguous with a Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS ) homology region .
In extracts from nonstimulated cells the receptor is recovered in an inducible cytoplasmic form associated with the 90-kDa heat shock protein ( hsp90 ) , a molecular chaperone .
We have reconstituted ligand-dependent activation of the receptor to a DNA-binding form by using the dioxin receptor and its bHLH-PAS partner factor Arnt expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate .
Deletion of the PAS domain of the receptor resulted in constitutive dimerization with Arnt .
In contrast , this receptor mutant showed low levels of xenobiotic response element-binding activity , indicating that the PAS domain may be important for DNA-binding affinity and/or specificity of the receptor .
It was not possible to reconstitute dioxin receptor function with proteins expressed in wheat germ lysate .
In line with these observations , reticulocyte lysate but not wheat germ lysate promoted the association of de novo synthesized dioxin receptor with hsp90 .
At least two distinct domains of the receptor mediated interaction with hsp90 : the ligand-binding domain located within the PAS region and , surprisingly , the bHLH domain .
Whereas ligand-binding activity correlated with association with hsp90 , bHLH-hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA-binding activity but not for dimerization of the receptor .
Several distinct roles for hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function are therefore likely : correct folding of the ligand-binding domain , interference with Arnt heterodimerization , and folding of a DNA-binding conformation of the bHLH domain .
Thus , the dioxin receptor system provides a complex and interesting model of the regulation of transcription factors by hsp90 .
The human interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells .
Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level .
We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytohemaglutinin ( PHA ) and the phorbol ester , PMA , activated transcription initiation from the IL-3 gene .
To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation , we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL-3 gene 5' and 3' flanking sequences .
Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene .
The promoter region between -173 and -60 contained the strongest activating elements .
The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter .
We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA/PHA .
We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) can be mediated , at least in part , by damage to extrathymic T-cell precursors in bone marrow and fetal liver .
This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene .
TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor ( the AhR ) and not through effects on the estrogen receptor .
Both TCDD and estradiol induce extrathymic T-cell differentiation in the liver .
These extrathymic T-cell populations include cells expressing elevated levels of V beta T-cell receptors that are normally deleted in thymic development .
Lung disease associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) may be amenable to somatic gene therapy in which there is delivery of the normal gene directly to the respiratory epithelium using E1a- adenovirus ( Ad ) type 2- or 5-based vectors .
For safety reasons , the Ad vectors are rendered replication deficient by deletion of the E1a region .
Because there is the theoretical possibility of an E1a- replication-deficient vector replicating as a result of recombination or complementation with Ad 2/5 E1a sequences present in the target cell , this study is directed toward evaluating respiratory epithelium of normals and individuals with CF for the presence of E1a sequences .
Using Ad 2/5 E1a-specific primers and the polymerase chain reaction to evaluate DNA recovered from freshly isolated nasal and bronchial epithelium recovered by brushing , E1a sequences were detected in respiratory epithelium of 19 of 91 normals ( 21 % ) .
In the E1a-positive samples , the average of E1a copy number was 55 +/- 18/10(3) recovered cells .
In CF individuals , 7 of 52 ( 13 % ) had detectable E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium , with E1a copy number in the positive samples of 80 +/- 21/10(3) recovered cells .
These results demonstrate that there are detectable Ad 2/5 E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium of a small percentage of normals and individuals with CF .
Because of the theoretical potential of such sequences supporting replication of E1a- Ad vectors , human gene therapy protocols for CF utilizing such vectors should consider evaluating study individuals for the presence of Ad 2/5 E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium .
The regulation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activation by the T cell receptor ( TcR ) /CD3 complex in primary human T cells has been studied at various times after activation .
Only p50 NF-kappa B protein bound the kappa B element of interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain promoter on resting T cells .
However , immediately after TcR/CD3 cross-linking ( after approximately 1 h ; immediate ) binding of p50.p65 heterodimers was observed .
p50.c-rel heterodimers were also detected bound to this sequence at early time points ( 7-16 h ; early ) , and both remained active at later time points ( 40 h ; late ) after activation .
This regulation takes place mainly at the level of nuclear translocation of p65 and c-rel , at immediate and early time points .
Activation also induced c-rel and p105/p50 mRNA synthesis , but not p65 mRNA whose expression was constitutive .
Interestingly , all those early and late events , but not the immediate ones , were inhibited by a neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) monoclonal antibody .
Similarly , cycloheximide prevented the p65 and c-rel translocation and consequent formation of active binding heterodimers , at early and late times .
Cyclosporin A impaired not only early and late , but also immediate events ; however , addition of TNF-alpha prevented all inhibition .
These results indicate that the regulation of NF-kappa B activation during T cell activation by TcR/CD3 signals is biphasic : TcR/CD3 triggers its immediate translocation , which is transient if no TNF-alpha is present .
TNF-alpha , therefore , emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of NF-kappa B regulation , controlling both translocation of p65 and c-rel , and new mRNA synthesis for c-rel and p105/p50 .
The aim of this present study was to investigate the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , downstream of p21ras , in activating interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene expression .
It has been reported that PKC is an effector of p21ras in T cells .
Data is presented , using the potent and selective PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8425 and transient expression of a constitutively active ras mutant , which clearly shows that PKC is not downstream of p21ras in the induction of NF-AT and AP-1 transcriptional activity and in the expression of IL-2 in human Jurkat T cells .
Reporter gene experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B transcriptional activity is not affected by expression of activated p21ras .
The signaling pathways involving PKC activation , calcium mobilization and ras activation combine to provide the necessary components for production of IL-2 during T cell activation .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is controlled by a complex array of virally encoded and cellular proteins .
A wide spectrum of levels of HIV-1 expression have been demonstrated in various cells , both in cell culture and in vivo .
Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV-1 replication may differ between certain cell types .
It is now demonstrated that HIV-1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV-1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross-linking studies .
A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , rather than the p50-p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .
This pattern of NF-kappa B-related moieties differs from the latently infected T lymphocytic cell line ACH-2 , and from the U937 monocytic line , the parental cell line of the U1 cellular clone .
As such , these data suggest that different proximal mechanisms may lead to restricted HIV-1 replication in various cell types .
A function for protein kinase C-zeta ( PKC-zeta ) , a member of the phorbol ester nonresponsive atypical protein kinase C subfamily , in modulating differentiation was examined in the leukemic U937 cell .
Transfected U937 cells stably overexpressing PKC-zeta displayed a longer doubling time , lower saturation density at confluency , and an increase in adherence to plastic as compared to control cells .
PKC-zeta cells expressed a more differentiated phenotype as assessed by changes in morphology , surface antigen expression , and lysosomal enzyme activities and were distinct from parental U937 cells stimulated to differentiate by exposure to phorbol esters .
In contrast to parental U937 cells , PKC-zeta cells constitutively expressed mRNA transcripts for c-jun and a low mobility AP-1 binding activity .
Thus , PKC-zeta overexpression stimulates a type of phenotypic differentiation that differs significantly from maturation occurring upon activation of other PKC subfamilies induced by phorbol ester treatment .
Increased expression of the c-jun protooncogene and an increase in AP-1 binding activity in PKC-zeta cells provides a potential mechanism for explaining the altered differentiation status of this cell .
Karyotypic detection of chromosomal 16 abnormalities classically associated with AML M4Eo can be difficult .
Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv(16)(p13q22) , CBF beta and MYH11 , has allowed the detection of fusion transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
We have analyzed CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts by RT-PCR in myelomonocytic leukemias , with or without eosinophilia , to determine whether their presence correlates with morphology .
Fifty-three cases ( 11 AML M4Eo ; 1 AML M4 with atypical abnormal eosinophils ( AML M4 " Eo " ) ; 29 AML M4 ; 8 AML M5 ; 3 CMML ; and 1 AML M2 with eosinophilia ) were analyzed .
All 11 typical AML M4Eo were CBF beta-MYH11 positive .
The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype , RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
Three of 29 ( 10 % ) AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils were CBF beta-MYH11 positive , 1 of which did not show any apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis ( 2 not tested ) .
Both cases tested also showed MYH11 genomic rearrangement .
None of the other leukemias were RT-PCR positive .
Follow-up of three patient showed residual positivity in apparent complete remission .
These data show that CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo , but also in approximately 10 % of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities , a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest .
Taken together with the detection of CBF beta-MYH11 transcripts in the absence of apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical banding techniques , these data show that additional screening by either RT-PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4 , regardless of morphologic features , to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this fusion transcript .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) in advanced stage were enriched for blasts and tested for ( 1 ) karyotype , ( 2 ) genomic configuration and ( 3 ) expression of IL-3 , GM-CSF , FMS and EGR-1 genes which are all located on the long arm of chromosome 5 .
The expression of the M-CSF gene , that has been recently reassigned to the short arm of chromosome 1 ( lp ) , was also investigated .
Aims of the study were to ( 1 ) assess the potential role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clones and ( 2 ) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one allele followed by a deletion of the second allele of the same genes in the leukemic cells .
The latter issue was investigated by comparing , in 8 cases , constitutive DNA from skin fibroblasts with leukemic DNA .
Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes .
The M-CSF gene was expressed in 6 cases and the FMS and the EGR-1 genes were expressed in 2 of the latter cases .
An autocrine mechanism of growth could be hypothesized only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the M-CSF and FMS genes .
No germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied .
Thus , deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does not seem to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression .
Recent biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in addition to the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2 , other B cell components are required for lymphoid-restricted , octamer site-mediated immunoglobulin gene promoter activity .
Using a genetic screen in yeast , we have isolated B cell-derived cDNAs encoding Oct-binding factor 1 ( OBF-1 ) , a novel protein that specifically associates with Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 , but not those of Oct-4 and Oct-6 .
The OBF-1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner , being most abundant in B cells and essentially absent in most of the other cells or tissues tested .
Furthermore , expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site-dependent manner .
Thus , OBF-1 has all the properties expected for a B cell-specific transcriptional coactivator protein .
Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor .
However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood .
A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so-called ' lysis genes ' by the activated receptor .
In this study , we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity , inhibition of interleukin-2 production , inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis .
Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but not target site specificity , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival .
The interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( IL-2R alpha ) gene is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli .
Previously , an inducible enhancer between nucleotides -299 and -228 that contains NF-kappa B and CArG motifs was identified .
We now report the characterization of a second essential positive regulatory element located between nucleotides -137 and -64 that binds Elf-1 and HMG-I(Y) .
This element had maximal activity in lymphoid cells , paralleling the cell type specificity of Elf-1 expression .
Transcription from the IL-2R alpha promoter was inhibited when either the Elf-1 or the HMG-I(Y) binding site was mutated .
Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the -137 to -64 element in COS-7 cells .
Elf-1 physically associated with HMG-I and with NF-kappa B p50 and c-Rel in vitro , suggesting that protein-protein interactions might functionally coordinate the actions of the upstream and downstream positive regulatory elements .
This is the first report of a physical interaction between an Ets family member and NF-kappa B family proteins .
These findings provide significant new insights into the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that regulate cell-type-specific and inducible IL-2R alpha gene expression and also have implications for other genes regulated by Elf-1 and NF-kappa B family proteins .
Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this may be through the modulation of transcription factor binding to DNA .
The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .
TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased AP-1 and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased CREB binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course .
Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .
These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , not to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors .
This suggests that in these cells GR within the nucleus interacts with cytokine-stimulated transcription factors by the process of cross coupling .
This may be an important molecular site of steroid action .
I kappa B-alpha inhibits transcription factor NF-kappa B by retaining it in the cytoplasm .
Various stimuli , typically those associated with stress or pathogens , rapidly inactivate I kappa B-alpha .
This liberates NF-kappa B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes important for the defense of the organism .
Activation of NF-kappa B correlates with phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor .
When either serine-32 or serine-36 of I kappa B-alpha was mutated , the protein did not undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation , and NF-kappa B could not be activated .
These results suggest that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of NF-kappa B .
LMP-1 , an Epstein-Barr virus membrane protein expressed during latent infection , has oncogenic properties , as judged from its ability to transform B lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
LMP-1 induces the expression of bcl2 , an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis , as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control .
The mechanisms by which LMP-1 upregulates these proteins is unknown , but it is plausible that LMP-1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate transcription of oncogenic genes .
NF-kappa B , a transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in cell activation and growth control , has been shown to be activated by LMP-1 .
The mechanism ( s ) regulating this activation remains unknown .
Our data indicate that increased NF-kappa B DNA binding and functional activity are present in B-lymphoid cells stably or transiently expressing LMP-1 .
I kappa B alpha is selectively modified in LMP-1-expressing B cells .
A phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha and increased protein turnover-degradation correlate with increased NF-kappa B nuclear translocation .
This results in increased transcription of NF-kappa B-dependent-genes , including those encoding p105 and I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) .
These results indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-kappa B in B-cell lines by targeting I kappa B alpha .
Identification of the pathways activated by LMP-1 to result in posttranslational modifications of I kappa B alpha will aid in determining the role of this virus-host cell protein interaction in Epstein-Barr virus-mediated oncogenesis .
It is well documented that treatment of serum-grown HL60 cells with 10(-7) M all-trans retinoic acid ( all-trans RA ) induces neutrophil differentiation , whereas treatment with 10(-7) M 1 alpha , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induces differentiation towards monocytes .
In recent investigations , using serum-free grown HL60 cells , we observed that all-trans RA , at 10(-7) M , did not induce neutrophil differentiation and that all-trans RA , at 10(-8) M , reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation to 5 x 10(-9) M .
In this study , co-operative interactions between all-trans and 9-cis RA and D3 which promote neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells have been analysed in detail .
Treatment of serum-free grown HL60 cells with 5 x 10(-7) M all-trans RA or 9-cis RA resulted in sub-optimal neutrophil differentiation ( up to 25 % mature cells ) .
As shown for all-trans RA , 9-cis RA cooperated with D3 to promote monocyte differentiation .
Culture of HL60 cells in 5 x 10(-7) M 9-cis RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 resulted in promotion of neutrophil differentiation at 10(-15)-10(-12) D3 , a failure to differentiate and apoptosis at 10(-11)-10(-10) M D3 , followed by co-operativity between 9-cis RA and 5 x 10(-9) M D3 in inducing monocyte differentiation in the absence of neutrophil differentiation .
Similar results were obtained when HL60 cells were treated with 5 x 10(-7) all-trans RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 .
Cross titration analyses of the effects of 9-cis RA and D3 on HL60 cell differentiation were undertaken to determine the boundaries of the concentrations of each agent , alone and in combination , that give rise to optimal neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells .
The observed cooperativities between either 9-cis RA or all-trans RA and D3 have important implications for the use of combinations of these agents in differentiation therapy .
Present evidence indicates a pathway of signal transmission in T cells that is outlined in figure 1 .
The elevation in intracellular calcium that is induced by interactions at the antigen receptor leads to the activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin .
This in turn leads to the nuclear association of the cytosolic component of NF-ATc .
The activation of calcineurin and the nuclear import of NF-ATc can both be blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 in complex with their respective immunophilins .
Once in the nucleus , NF-ATc interacts with NF-ATn to form an active transcriptional complex .
NF-ATn is a ubiquitous protein , can be synthesized in response to PMA , and has many similarities to AP-1 .
The mechanism by which NF-ATc enters the nucleus is unknown , and although it appears to require calcineurin , NF-ATc has not yet been shown to be an in vivo substrate of calcineurin .
Alternative mechanisms include the possibility that NF-ATc operates on some cytoplasmic anchor or that other proteins that are controlled by calcineurin carry out the nuclear import of NF-ATc .
Although NF-ATp copurifies with NF-ATc , there is as yet no understanding of how NF-ATp is functioning in vivo .
Now that these proteins are purified and cloned , the major goals will be to understand their role and the roles of other family members in thymic development .
Signaling by a wide variety of cytokines , including interferons , interleukins , and growth factors , involves activation of JAK kinases and Stat ( Signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
At present , not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) exerts its diverse biologic effects .
Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL-5 and were used here to study IL-5 signaling in a primary human cell .
IL-5 induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 .
Moreover , IL-5 induced at least two DNA-binding complexes , using nuclear extracts from normal human eosinophils and the IL-6/interferon-gamma response element of the ICAM-1 promoter ( ICAM-1 pIRE ) in an electromobility shift assay .
From supershift experiments it was concluded that one DNA-binding complex contained Stat1 alpha , probably as a homodimer .
Both DNA-binding complexes were inhibited by a phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation .
IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced , similar to IL-5 , two DNA-binding complexes in human eosinophils , including Stat1 alpha .
These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of IL-5 signaling in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family .
The expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in our earlier reports .
The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia .
Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro , while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA .
Cells originating from cases of Burkitt 's lymphoma were negative .
By contrast , three lymphoblastoid cell lines ( immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus ) were weakly positive and MNDA was up-regulated by interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) treatment .
As we reported previously , MNDA mRNA level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN-alpha ; in this study , we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages .
Three additional agents ( endotoxin , phytohemagglutinin , and phorbol ester ) and other conditions that affect function , cytokine production , differentiation , and/or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression .
The results varied with the agent , cell type , and stage of differentiation .
Changes in MNDA expression occurred slowly ( hours to days ) , suggesting that MNDA could mediate changes realized over a long period .
The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and mRNA indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point .
Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages .
Although glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases , a small proportion of patients are resistant to their therapeutic effects .
The molecular mechanism for this steroid resistance is unclear .
Steroid resistance can not be explained by pharmacokinetic mechanisms , by a defect in the binding of steroids to glucocorticoid receptors , nor by defective nuclear translocation of this receptor , thereby suggesting that the molecular abnormality lies distal to nuclear translocation .
We examined the ability of nuclear translocated glucocorticoid receptors to bind to their DNA binding sites ( GRE ) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays in PBMC from patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant asthma .
The binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to DNA in these patients was also studied using Scatchard analysis .
Dexamethasone induced a significant rapid and sustained twofold increase in GRE binding in PBMCs from steroid-sensitive asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic individuals , but this was markedly reduced in steroid-resistant asthmatic patients .
Scatchard analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-GRE binding showed no change in binding affinity but did show a reduced number of receptors available for DNA binding in the steroid-resistant patients .
These results suggest that the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor to bind to GRE is impaired in steroid-resistant patients because of a reduced number of receptors available for binding to DNA .
BACKGROUND .
Increased expression of the HER-2/neu oncogene in breast cancer correlates with decreased estrogen receptor concentration and seems to be an important prognostic factor .
The authors investigated whether there is a correlation between HER-2/neu expression and immunologic parameters representing tumor defense in patients with breast cancer .
METHOD .
A Western blot analysis was used to investigate HER-2/neu expression , whereas a chromium-release assay using the K562 cell line as target was used to measure natural killer ( NK ) cell activity .
RESULTS .
In patients with breast cancer , NK cell activity was significantly higher compared with patients with benign tumors ( P = 0.006 ) or healthy control subjects ( P = 0.002 ) .
Moreover , 23.3 % of patients with breast cancer showed an overexpression of HER-2/neu protein .
Within this group of patients , NK cell activity was significantly lower ( 45.6 +/- 16.1 % ) compared with the group with no HER-2/neu overexpression ( 57.3 +/- 11.0 % ) .
NK cell activity did not increase in patients with HER-2/neu overexpression .
Thus , there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with HER-2/neu expression of the tumor ( P = 0.003 ) , and HER-2/neu overexpression correlated with a negative estrogen receptor status ( P = 0.005 ) .
CONCLUSION .
These data add further evidence to previous observations from the authors ' laboratory that certain tumor characteristics may be associated with reactions of the host with breast cancer .
The effects of interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) and interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on cellular functions were shown to be quite similar .
We provide evidence that in monocytes as well as in T lymphocytes both IL-4 and IL-13 activate the same recently identified transcription factor NF-IL4 which binds to the specific responsive element IL-4RE .
In addition , we show that a nuclear factor activated by interferon-gamma also interacts with the IL-4RE .
It differs from NF-IL4 in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex with DNA , in its DNA-binding specificity and in the proteins interacting with the DNA sequence .
Sensitivity against various enzyme inhibitors suggests that components of the signal transduction pathway are shared by all three cytokines .
Cytokine dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection has been documented in numerous studies and has been cited as an important component in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection .
Pharmacological modification of cytokine dysregulation , therefore , has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection .
Dr. Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital ( Boston ) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , a cytokine known to influence HIV-1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus .
Pentoxifylline , a trisubstituted xanthine derivative , has been used to decrease blood viscosity and is reasonably well tolerated by most recipients of the drug .
Results of preliminary studies , many of which were conducted by Dr. Dezube , suggest that use of this agent in combination with antiretroviral compounds may prove useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection .
J delta K cells were isolated as a chronically infected survivor cell line , following infection of Jurkat CD4+ T cells with dl-NF , a mutated strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) containing a deletion of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) NF-kappa B sites .
J delta K cells exhibited very low levels of constitutive HIV production .
HIV-1 expression was activated from J delta K cells by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , sodium butyrate ( NaB ) , or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) , but not tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , confirming the role of NF-kappa B in mediating TNF-alpha induction of HIV transcription .
The strong induction of HIV expression by NaB or HMBA in J delta K cells clearly demonstrates the existence of NF-kappa B-independent mechanisms of HIV activation in chronically infected cells .
J delta K cells may provide a useful model for characterizing NF-kappa B-independent transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR .
The POU DNA-binding motif defines a conserved family of eukaryotic transcription factors involved in regulation of gene expression .
This bipartite motif consists of an N-terminal POU-specific domain ( POUs ) , a flexible linker , and a C-terminal POU-specific homeodomain ( POUHD ) .
Here we describe the solution structure of a POU-specific homeodomain .
An NMR model is obtained from Oct-2 , a human B-cell specific transcription factor which participates in the regulation of immunoglobulin genes .
A fragment of Oct-2 containing POUHD and an adjoining linker was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized by three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ( 3D-NMR ) spectroscopy .
Complete 1H and 15N resonance assignment of the POUHD moiety is presented .
The POUHD solution structure , as calculated by distance geometry and simulated annealing ( DG/SA ) , is similar to that of canonical homeodomains .
A salient difference between solution and crystal structures is observed in the C-terminal segment of alpha-helix 3 ( the HTH recognition helix ) , which is not well ordered in solution .
Because this segment presumably folds upon specific DNA binding , its flexibility in solution may reduce the intrinsic DNA affinity of POUHD in the absence of POUs .
The role of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) Nef protein in T cell activation pathways was investigated using a Jurkat CD4+ cell line stably transfected with a Nef expression vector .
Secretion of IL-2 and TNF-alpha , surface expression of IL-2R , and DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 ( Fos/Jun ) complex in response to phorbol myristate acetate , TNF-alpha , or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored .
These parameters were not modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef+ Jurkat cells .
This inhibition was not mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition .
Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was not mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity but through the region containing the negative responding elements ( NREs ) .
These results suggest that Nef downmodulates LTR activation without significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations .
The NM23 gene has been proposed as a metastasis-suppressor gene , and its use has been suggested as prognostic factor .
NM23 was identified in a system of murine melanoma cell lines , in which an inverse relationship was found between NM23 expression and metastatic ability .
In a human malignant melanoma study NM23 expression was found to be significantly lower in metastases that developed less than 24 months after diagnosis of the primary tumours .
The present paper studies the expression of the NM23.H1 gene in cell lines which derive from primary or metastatic human malignant melanomas in relation to staging , infiltration degree , lymphocytic infiltration , cell morphology , cell pigmentation , karyotype , and disease-free survival .
The level of mRNA expression of the NM23 gene is significantly lower in cell lines that derive from more infiltrating primary melanomas than in cell lines obtained from less infiltrating tumours .
Moreover , cell lines derived from tumours of patients with a disease-free survival of more than 24 months ( 24-58 months ) express the NM23 gene at higher levels than cell lines obtained from melanomas of patients with a disease-free survival of less than 24 months ( 6-15 months ) .
Fast in vitro effects of aldosterone on the Na+/H(+)-exchanger , inositoltrisphosphate generation and corresponding specific binding to plasma membranes at Kd-values of approximately 0.1 nM have been found in human mononuclear leukocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells .
The novel aldosterone membrane receptor was analyzed on SDS-PAGE after labeling of microsomal membranes from human mononuclear leukocytes with a [125I]-aldosterone-derivative by use of BASED as a photoactivatable crosslinker .
Binding of 1 nM [125I]-aldosterone was found at a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa which was absent with 1 microM cold aldosterone , but not cortisol in the binding media .
This aldosterone-selectivity is typical and discriminatory for the new aldosterone membrane receptor .
Solubilization of the receptor protein from membranes by high salt concentrations ( 1 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) was not achieved .
It , thus , appears as an integral membrane protein .
Dithiothreitol , a sulfhydryl agent , does not reduce specific aldosterone binding indicating the absence of SH-groups in the binding domain or sensitive structures of the receptors .
The results are the first to characterize the novel membrane receptor for aldosterone with regard to molecular weight and basic properties .
These findings and other related results are reviewed here .
Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .
We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity .
The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .
On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B/Rel family proteins , the kappa B-binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit .
The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex , was not induced in the nucleus following activation .
Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells .
The altered kappa B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli .
RJ 2.2.5 is a human B cell mutant derived from the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function .
This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .
Here we show , by in vivo DNase I footprinting , that the AIR-1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy .
Interestingly , reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern .
DRA promoter occupancy in other class II-negative B cell lines , derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome , is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2.2.5 and Raji cells .
Moreover , the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients ' cell lines do not display a completely " bare promoter " as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent .
Thus , the use of DNase I allowed us , for the first time , to correlate the AIR-1 locus defect with class II promoter occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct MHC class II-negative cells .
Androgen receptor mRNA was translated in vitro , and androgen- and antiandrogen-bound receptor complexes were studied using limited proteolytic digestion by trypsin .
Partial proteolysis of androgen-bound receptor protein resulted in a 29-kDa proteolysis-resisting fragment , whereas antiandrogen binding stabilised a 35-kDa fragment .
Both fragments contain the entire ligand binding domain , and the 35-kDa fragment extended into the hinge region of the receptor .
Several antiandrogens show agonistic properties for a mutated androgen receptor ( LNCaP cell variant ) ; trypsin digestion of antiandrogen-bound mutated receptor also resulted in a 29-kDa fragment .
Our results point to an important difference between antiandrogens and antagonists of other steroid hormone receptors .
Antiandrogens result in protection of both the hinge region and C-terminus of the androgen receptor agonist proteolytic attack , whereas other studies showed that antiestrogens and antiprogestagens expose the C-terminal end of the ligand binding domain of their respective receptors to protease .
Differences in conformation of the hinge region distinguish androgen-bound from antiandrogen-bound receptor complexes , which represents an important feature of antiandrogen action .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) , a vitamin A derivative , exerts a wide range of biological effects related to cell proliferation and differentiation .
The pleiotropic effects of RA are thought to be mediated through specific nuclear RA receptors ( RARs ) .
RARs are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and exhibit a molecular structure that possess discrete DNA-binding and RA ( ligand ) -binding domains .
In hematopoietic system , RA and RARs , predominantly RAR alpha may play key roles for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors .
However , it is currently unknown how RA and RARs are involved in regulating normal hematopoietic differentiation .
To make clear the roles of RA and RAR alpha in the normal hematopoiesis , I have introduced the construct of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha ) into murine bone marrow cells with retroviral vector , and selected infected cells with drug resistant marker ( Neo(r) ) cultured on the stroma cell line ( PA6-neo ) , and analyzed the behavior of infected cells .
All of procedure were done in vitro .
Most cells infected with hRAR alpha exhibited promyelocytic morphology and were thought to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage in their myeloid differentiation .
Furthermore , these immature cells differentiated terminally into mature granulocytes by adding with RA ( 10(-6) M ) .
RAR alpha infected cells were also able to differentiate into mature macrophages in the both of long term culture and IL3 colony .
These observations suggest that an overexpression of RAR alpha alone is effective to suppress myeloid cell differentiation and RAR alpha plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of myeloid precursors .
The system described here may serve as a model for studying the the essential genes for differentiation of normal bone marrow cells .
cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation .
Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA , but it was induced in T-lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens .
In contrast , cdc2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants .
In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells , we isolated the 5'-flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides -124 to -117 .
The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel-retardation assay and DNaseI footprinting in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes , which was coincident with the expression of cdc2 mRNA .
E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes .
Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that the region containing E2F binding site had a strong promoter activity , and introduction of the mutation at the E2F binding site resulted in a significant loss of the activity .
E2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs were not detectable in granulocytes , monocytes and resting T-lymphocytes but were induced after the mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes .
The induction of E2F activity preceded the appearance of cdc2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression .
These results suggest that cdc2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that E2F plays some roles in the regulation of its expression .
The differentiating agent retinoic acid ( RA ) has been previously reported to interfere with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) /Ca(2+)-induced signals for the regulation of the -96 to -66-bp octamer motif found in the enhancer for the interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene , which encodes a major T lymphocyte growth factor .
The IL-2 octamer motif is a composite cis-element which binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 as well as a TPA/Ca(2+)-inducible nuclear factor , previously termed octamer-associated protein ( OAP40 ) .
We show here that Oct-2 , despite the presence of an active transcriptional activation domain , requires TPA/Ca(2+)-induced signals to strongly transactivate the IL-2 octamer motif in Jurkat T cells .
This Oct-2-dependent transactivation is inhibited by RA .
The presence of an intact COOH-terminal domain of Oct-2 contributes to both TPA/Ca(2+)-induced transactivation and the RA-mediated repression .
We also show that both Fos and Jun components of the AP-1 factors participate in the OAP40 complex .
Furthermore , transfected c-jun , jun-B , jun-D , c-fos , or Fos-B expression vectors partially substitute for TPA and Ca2+ and cooperate with Oct-2 for the transactivation of the combined OAP/octamer cis-element .
Mutations of the genuine octamer-binding site abrogate both the binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the TPA/Ca(2+)-induced transactivation of the OAP/octamer motif .
OAP confers to Oct-2 responsivity to both TPA/Ca2+ and RA , since specific mutations of the AP-1/OAP-binding site significantly reduce the transactivation by Oct-2 in response to TPA and Ca2+ and abolish the inhibition by RA .
Furthermore , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) alpha is able to inhibit in vitro the formation of the complex between the nuclear AP-1/OAP and its specific binding site , resulting in the interference with Oct-2-dependent cis-regulatory function of this AP-1 element .
Therefore , we propose that the TPA/calcium-activated AP-1/OAP element is the main target of positive or negative regulatory signals influencing the IL-2 octamer motif , through synergism with Oct-2 and antagonism by RAR .
The tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a potent transcriptional activator that both stimulates viral gene expression and activates an array of cellular genes involved in T-cell growth .
Tax acts indirectly by inducing or modifying the action of various host transcription factors , including members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of enhancer-binding proteins .
In resting T cells , many of these NF-kappa B/Rel factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm by various ankyrin-rich inhibitory proteins , including I kappa B alpha .
HTLV-I Tax expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active NF-kappa B and c-Rel complexes ; however , the biochemical mechanism ( s ) underlying this response remains poorly understood .
In this study , we demonstrate that Tax-stimulated nuclear expression of NF-kappa B in both HTLV-I-infected and Tax-transfected human T cells is associated with the phosphorylation and rapid proteolytic degradation of I kappa B alpha .
In contrast to prior in vitro studies , at least a fraction of the phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha remains physically associated with the NF-kappa B complex in vivo but is subject to rapid degradation , thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of the active NF-kappa B complex .
We further demonstrate that Tax induction of nuclear c-Rel expression is activated by the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of NF-kappa B , which activates transcription of the c-rel gene through an intrinsic kappa B enhancer element .
In normal cells , the subsequent accumulation of nuclear c-Rel acts to inhibit its own continued production , indicating the presence of an autoregulatory loop .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
The effect of a liposomal formulation of methylprednisolone ( MPL ) on the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in spleen cells was investigated following IV dosing in rats .
Liposomes do not alter the suppressive action of MPL when placed in lymphocyte culture .
Rat splenocytes were found to have greater sensitivity to MPL ( EC50 = 7.9 nM ) than do human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( EC50 = 28 nM ) .
In vivo studies in rats utilized 2 mg/kg IV bolus doses of liposomal MPL compared to drug in solution .
Animals were sacrificed at various times post-dosing until 120 h , spleen was excised and , after incubation of lymphocytes with PHA , splenocyte blastogenic responses were assessed by measuring cellular incorporation of 3H-thymidine .
The suppressive effect of liposomal MPL in comparison with free drug was significantly prolonged ( > 120 h vs < 18 h ) .
Inhibition effects versus time were described by a pharmacodynamic model using MPL concentrations in plasma as an input function .
A nonlinear relationship was found between suppression of splenocyte proliferation and the concentration of bound glucocorticoid receptors in spleen .
Only partial receptor occupancy accompanied complete lymphocyte suppression .
The suppression of endogenous corticosterone in plasma for both treatments was similar with values from L-MPL rats returning to baseline after 24 h .
These results demonstrate enhanced efficacy of local immunosuppression by targeting spleen with liposomal MPL .
The tal-1 gene , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis .
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or without tal-1 rearrangements .
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus .
Methylation studies indicated that the tal-15 ' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines .
Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal-1 locus .
HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .
HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line .
HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T-cell line that bears a t (1;14) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4 .
These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters .
T cell hybridomas respond to activation signals by undergoing apoptotic cell death , and this is likely to represent comparable events related to tolerance induction in immature and mature T cells in vivo .
Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the c-Myc protein in the phenomenon of activation-induced apoptosis .
This role for c-Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , Max , which we show here inhibits activation-induced apoptosis .
Further , coexpression of a reciprocally mutant Myc protein capable of forming functional heterodimers with the mutant Max can compensate for the dominant negative activity and restore activation-induced apoptosis .
These results imply that Myc promotes activation-induced apoptosis by obligatory heterodimerization with Max , and therefore , by regulating gene transcription .
Infection with a variant of simian immunodeficiency virus , SIVsmmPBj14 , leads to severe acute disease in macaques .
This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of previously described mutations in the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and to elucidate their contribution to the unique phenotype of SIVsmmPBj14 .
LTR-directed transcription was measured by using luciferase reporter constructs that were transiently transfected into cultured cells .
In a wide range of cell types , the basal transcriptional activity of the LTR from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to be 2- to 4.5-fold higher than that of an LTR from a non-acutely pathogenic strain .
These LTRs differ by five point mutations and a 22-bp duplication in SIVsmmPBj14 , which includes a nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) site .
Transcriptional differences between these LTRs were further enhanced by two- to threefold upon treatment of cells with phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha or by cotransfection with plasmids expressing NF kappa B subunits .
Mutagenesis studies , and the use of a reporter construct containing an enhancerless promoter , indicate that these transcriptional effects are due principally to the 22-bp sequence duplication and the NF kappa B site contained within it .
Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic except for the LTR were generated .
The LTR from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to confer an increase in the kinetics of virus replication in cultured cells .
Inclusion of this LTR in recombinant SIVs also resulted in a two- to threefold rise in the extent of cellular proliferation that was induced in quiescent simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that LTR mutations assist SIVsmmPBj14 in responding efficiently to cellular stimulation and allow it to replicate to high titers during the acute phase of viral infection .
The protein products of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) BMLF1 open reading frame have been characterized in the early productive cycle in B95-8 and Akata cells .
The SM protein derived from the spliced RNA joining BSLF2 to BMLF1 is much the most abundant protein .
SM is a phosphoprotein in EBV-infected cells and can be phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II ( CKII ) .
Computer analysis of the SM protein sequence showed a C terminal section of SM to be related to genome positional homologues of four other herpesviruses and revealed consensus CKII sites near the N termini of the EBV SM protein , the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) ICP27 protein and the herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) open reading frame 57 protein .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the consensus CKII site in EBV SM greatly reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of SM by CKII .
The mechanism of transactivation by BMLF1 proteins has been controversial but SM was shown to transactivate gene expression from a CAT reporter construct by increasing the amount of cytoplasmic CAT mRNA .
Mutagenesis of the CKII site in SM made no difference to the transactivation in this transient transfection assay .
The tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells , in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis .
Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone , via a calcineurin-dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A .
We have previously identified a promoter element , kappa 3 , that is required for calcium-stimulated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells .
Here , we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp , a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription .
NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element , and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction .
Thus , although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites , it appears to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp .
The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation .
We have examined the feasibility of using interferon ( IFN ) gene transfer as a novel approach to anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) therapy in this study .
To limit expression of a transduced HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -IFNA2 ( the new approved nomenclature for IFN genes is used throughout this article ) hybrid gene to the HIV-1-infected cells , HIV-1 LTR was modified .
Deletion of the NF-kappa B elements of the HIV-1 LTR significantly inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in T-cell lines , as well as in a monocyte line , U937 .
Replacement of the NF-kappa B elements in the HIV-1 LTR by a DNA fragment derived from the 5'-flanking region of IFN-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , containing the IFN-stimulated response element , partially restored Tat-mediated activation of LTR in T cells as well as in monocytes .
Insertion of this chimeric promoter ( ISG15 LTR ) upstream of the human IFNA2 gene directed high levels of IFN synthesis in Tat-expressing cells , while this promoter was not responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated activation .
ISG15-LTR-IFN hybrid gene inserted into the retrovirus vector was transduced into Jurkat and U937 cells .
Selected transfected clones produced low levels of IFN A ( IFNA ) constitutively , and their abilities to express interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptor upon stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate were retained .
Enhancement of IFNA synthesis observed upon HIV-1 infection resulted in significant inhibition of HIV-1 replication for a period of at least 30 days .
Virus isolated from IFNA-producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but did not replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene .
These results suggest that targeting IFN synthesis to HIV-1-infected cells is an attainable goal and that autocrine IFN synthesis results in a long-lasting and permanent suppression of HIV-1 replication .
Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP-1 ) oncogene is regulated by the EBV nuclear protein 2 ( EBNA-2 ) transactivator .
EBNA-2 is known to interact with the cellular DNA-binding protein J kappa and is recruited to promoters containing the GTGGGAA J kappa recognition sequence .
The minimal EBNA-2-responsive LMP-1 promoter includes one J kappa-binding site , and we now show that mutation of that site , such that J kappa can not bind , reduces EBNA-2 responsiveness by 60 % .
To identify other factors which interact with the LMP-1 EBNA-2 response element ( E2RE ) , a -236/-145 minimal E2RE was used as a probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The previously characterized factors J kappa , PU.1 , and AML1 bind to the LMP-1 E2RE , along with six other unidentified factors ( LBF2 to LBF7 ) .
Binding sites were mapped for each factor .
LBF4 is B- and T-cell specific and recognizes the PU.1 GGAA core sequence as shown by methylation interference .
LBF4 has a molecular mass of 105 kDa and is probably unrelated to PU.1 .
LBF2 was found only in epithelial cell lines , whereas LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , and LBF7 were not cell type specific .
Mutations of the AML1- or LBF4-binding sites had no effect on EBNA-2 transactivation , whereas mutation of the PU.1-binding site completely eliminated EBNA-2 responses .
A gst-EBNA-2 fusion protein specifically depleted PU.1 from nuclear extracts and bound in vitro translated PU.1 , providing biochemical evidence for a direct EBNA-2-PU.1 interaction .
Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of the LMP-1 promoter is dependent on interaction with at least two distinct sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins , J kappa and PU.1 .
LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 may also be involved , since their binding sites also contribute to EBNA-2 responsiveness .
We examined the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , which potently blocks the activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , on the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents .
Treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL-60 , with 10 micrograms/mL etoposide or 2 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced NF-kappa B activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3-4 hr .
The simultaneous addition of 50-500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked NF-kappa B activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr .
However , PDTC failed to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates .
The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in human thymocytes at a concentration of 1-10 microM .
Since PDTC has both antioxidant and metal-ion chelating activities , we tested the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) ( antioxidant ) or o-phenanthroline ( OP ) ( metal-ion chelator ) on the induction of apoptosis .
Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or thymocytes with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr , but not 10-60 mM NAC , suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide .
These results suggest that the activation of NF-kappa B plays an important role in the apoptotic process of human hematopoietic cells .
Oct2-isoform expression in splenic B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide plus phorbol-di-butyrate was analysed by cDNA cloning .
The frequency of Oct2-positive clones was 1/15,000 in both libraries .
Two new isoforms were found that generate novel amino- or carboxy-terminal sequences .
An isoform lacking exon 11 destroyed the carboxy-terminal leucin-zipper region and introduced a frame shift creating a novel , proline-rich carboxy terminus .
A new exon containing a highly basic region ( 4c ) was characterized , between exons 4 and 5 .
This exon was inserted between glutamine-rich regions 2 and 3 , carboxy terminal of a tentative leucine-zipper structure .
In addition , a new combination isoform containing Oct2a 's amino terminal insert ( exon 7a ) and Oct2b 's carboxy terminal insert ( exon 13 ) was found that created a novel large isoform , Oct2ab .
More frequent use of the classical Oct2a and Oct2b isoforms was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells , while a preference for the Oct2ab and Oct2ba isoforms was observed in lipopolysaccharide plus phorbol-di-butyrate-treated cells .
NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor .
Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system .
Among these properties are NF-kappa B 's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins .
In vertebrates , five distinct DNA binding subunits are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize , thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity , DNA sequence specificity , and cell type- and cell stage-specific distribution .
The activity of DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates .
I kappa B proteins inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of NF-kappa B complexes .
An exception is the Bcl-3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in th nucleus .
Other I kappa B proteins are rather involved in terminating NF-kappa B 's activity in the nucleus .
The intracellular events that lead to the inactivation of I kappa B , i.e. the activation of NF-kappa B , are complex .
They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells ' redox status .
Interference with the activation or activity of NF-kappa B may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock , graft-vs-host reactions , acute inflammatory reactions , acute phase response , and radiation damage .
The inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes .
Murine B lymphocytes , adipocytes , and olfactory neurons contain a DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of genes encoding tissue-specific components of signal transduction .
Purification and cloning of this protein , termed early B-cell factor ( EBF ) , from murine B lymphocytes and independent cloning of a protein , termed Olf-1 , from olfactory neuronal cells revealed virtual complete amino acid sequence identity between these proteins .
As a first step towards identifying a human genetic disorder or mouse mutation for which EBF could be a candidate gene , we have chromosomally mapped the corresponding locus in both species .
By Southern hybridization analyses of somatic cell hybrid panels with murine cDNA probe , fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of human genomic clones , and analysis of recombinant inbred mouse strains , we have found single sites for EBF homologous sequences on human Chromosome ( Chr ) 5 , band q34 , and on proximal mouse Chr 11 , in an evolutionarily conserved region .
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic , ciprofloxacin ( cipro ) , induces hyperproduction of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated ( T cell mitogens or alloantigens ) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( 5-80 micrograms/ml ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics .
However , in contrast to human lymphocytes , IFN-gamma production was inhibited and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were unaffected at 24 h and only slightly upregulated at 48 and 72 h of culture in murine splenocytes incubated with cipro ( 20 micrograms/ml ) .
EL-4 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter and enhancer region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene .
Analysis of CAT activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL-2 gene induction .
In addition , EL-4 cells incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT-1 ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics .
Cipro did not affect the nuclear transcription factors AP-1 or NFIL-2A .
Taken together , cipro inhibited IFN-gamma synthesis , but enhanced IL-2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT-1 and causing an increased IL-2 transcription .
The interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) gene is both an immediate-early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes .
To understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1 , we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter .
Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells , 1.7 kilobases ( kb ) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene mediated a 30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation .
Deletion mutants containing 1.3 , 0.6 , and 0.2 kb 5'-flanking DNA were incrementally less transcriptionally active , although 0.2 kb still mediated a 12-fold induction by PRL .
The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter failed to respond to PRL stimulation , suggesting that the activity of upstream PRL response elements may require an interaction with promoter-proximal elements .
By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24-h PRL induction time course , we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and promoter DNA .
The 0.2-kb IRF-CAT construct was induced by PRL stimulation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
In contrast , the 1.7-kb IRF-CAT construct was inducible by PRL during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle .
Hence , the PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene appears to be controlled by separate PRL-responsive elements : elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1 promoter region act during early activation , and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression .
Expression of the human PRL ( hPRL ) gene in extrapituitary sites such as the uterus ( decidualized endometrial stroma and myometrium ) and cells of the hematopoietic lineage is directed by an alternative promoter which is located approximately 6 kilobases ( kb ) upstream of the pituitary-specific start site .
In order to delineate the tissue-specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary PRL gene expression , we have cloned and sequenced 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA of the upstream decidual/lymphoid ( dPRL ) promoter .
Based on sequence homology we identified two binding motifs for Pit-1 and seven half-sites for glucocorticoid receptor/progesterone receptor ( PR ) binding .
We focused our studies on the role of Pit-1 and of PR as potential transcriptional regulators , since the POU domain protein Pit-1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression , and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma , a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated .
We demonstrate in a variety of cell types , including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma , that Pit-1 is not involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA .
Our experiments also show that activated PR does not confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter .
When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells , we found that the 3 kb 5'-flanking region of the dPRL promoter did not contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene .
This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL , but did not allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells .
Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP , in the absence of progesterone , suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression .
The sex-determining gene SRY was screened for molecular alteration in an XY sex-reversed female by single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique .
An A-to-G transition was detected which leads to an exchange of a tyrosine by a cysteine in the SRY protein .
The affected tyrosine residue located at the C terminus of the DNA binding protein is evolutionarily strongly conserved among the members of the HMG box containing proteins .
Using gel shift assay and peptide synthesis such a mutation is shown to abolish the SRY protein DNA binding ability .
The involvement of this particular amino acid in the binding specificity is also discussed .
IL-4 , a product of the T-helper 0 ( Th0 ) and 2 ( Th2 ) subset , was originally described as a B-cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS , and to upregulate IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL1-RA ) gene expression .
In this study we investigated the effect of IL-4 on the expression of cytokine genes in monocytes evoked by other T-helper cell cytokines : IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF .
IL-4 down-regulated mRNA accumulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha in monocytes stimulated with IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF .
IL-4 also suppressed the IL-2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression .
Temporal analysis of the IL-4 down-regulatory effect on the IL-2- , IL-3- , or GM-CSF-induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in monocytes provided evidence that IL-4 acts predominantly on the post-transcriptional level .
This was supported by the observation that the down-regulatory capacity of IL-4 appeared to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
IL-4 did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL-1-RA or various CSFs by IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF .

The cascade of events within the first few minutes of T cell stimulation has been well characterized .
Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems , the rate-limiting step in peripheral T cells has not been demonstrated .
To model effective versus ineffective CD3-mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells , we used two anti-CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells : OKT3 , which causes early second messenger generation but is unable to activate T cells without a second signal , and 64.1 , which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own .
We found that tyrosine kinase activity was similar for both mAbs over a period of hours .
However , the inositol phosphate response was stronger for 64.1 than for OKT3 .
To tie these events to gene activation , we measured NF-kappa B and NF-AT activity in the nucleus after anti-CD3 stimulation .
Both stimuli induced the appearance of the NF-kappa B components ( c-Rel , p65 ( RelA ) , and p50 ( NF-kappa B1 ) ) and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity in the nucleus .
However , only 64.1 induced NF-AT in the nucleus , correlating with its ability to activate T cells .
Thus , NF-AT induction and IL-2 secretion were correlated with the levels of inositol phosphate release but not with gross levels of tyrosine kinase activity induced late following the response .
On the other hand , NF-kappa B induction and IL-2 receptor expression occurred even with the smaller second messenger response generated by OKT3 .
Several mammalian responses to UV irradiation , including the activation of NF-kappa B , are believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation .
UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment of T lymphocytes induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals similar to those observed following biological stimulation .
We have examined the role of cell surface molecules in these responses .
Normal T lymphocytes whose surface expression of CD3 was depleted showed impaired UV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals .
Similarly , Jurkat T cell lines deficient in CD3 or CD45 expression also gave impaired UV responses .
However , all these cell types still gave strong Ca2+ and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to H2O2 .
The T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 was found to be highly responsive to UV and H2O2 treatment .
ZAP-70 responsiveness to UV required expression of both CD3 and CD45 , whereas only CD3 was required for the response to H2O2 .
UV-induced activation of NF-kappa B was blocked by CD3 depletion , indicating the importance of such cell surface molecules in biological responses to UV .
In nonlymphoid cells , the epidermal growth factor receptor displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within seconds of UV irradiation .
These results suggest that UV-induced signal transduction is mediated via cell surface receptors that normally respond to biological stimulation , whereas H2O2 is able to partially bypass this requirement .
The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , and adhesion molecules .
The anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B , which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs .
This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF-kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B , and therefore NF-kappa B was retained in the cytosol .
Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited NF-kappa B-dependent transcription from the Ig kappa enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in transfected T cells .
Subunit 6 ( S6 ) , an integral component of the 26S protease from human erythrocytes , has been studied by SDS-PAGE , peptide mapping and sequence analysis .
S6 was cleaved with CNBr and three internal peptides were sequenced .
A comparison with known proteins in Genbank revealed that all three S6 peptides match the predicted sequence of TBP7 , Tat-binding protein 7 .
Based on peptide matches covering more than 10 % of the TBP7 sequence , and the fact that the migration of S6 on SDS-PAGE is consistent with the estimated molecular mass for TBP7 , we conclude that subunit 6 of the 26S protease is TBP7 .
Binding of superantigens to MHC class II molecules results in transduction of biochemical signals leading to cellular activation and gene expression .
We demonstrate that the staphylococcal superantigens toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ( TSST-1 ) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A ( SEA ) activate HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 .
Induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription in THP-1 cells by superantigens was associated with the induction of nuclear factor-kappa B DNA-binding activity .
Superantigens also increased viral protein secretion from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-pretreated chronically infected human monocytic cell line U1 .
Induction of HIV-1 gene expression in monocytic cells by superantigens occurred via tumor necrosis factor-alpha-dependent and -independent mechanisms .
Our results suggest that superantigens and other MHC class II ligands may activate HIV-1 gene expression in monocytes/macrophages .
The t(17;19) translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemias results in creation of E2A-hepatic leukemia factor ( HLF ) chimeric proteins that contain the DNA-binding and protein dimerization domains of the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) protein HLF fused to a portion of E2A proteins with transcriptional activation properties .
An in vitro binding site selection procedure was used to determine DNA sequences preferentially bound by wild-type HLF and chimeric E2A-HLF proteins isolated from various t(17;19)-bearing leukemias .
All were found to selectively bind the consensus sequence 5'-GTTACGTAAT-3' with high affinity .
Wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins also bound closely related sites identified previously for bZIP proteins of both the proline- and acidic amino acid-rich ( PAR ) and C/EBP subfamilies ; however , E2A-HLF proteins were significantly less tolerant of certain deviations from the HLF consensus binding site .
These differences were directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain in all E2A-HLF chimeras and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate .
Both wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins displayed transcriptional activator properties in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells on reporter genes containing HLF or C/EBP consensus binding sites .
But on reporter genes with nonoptimal binding sites , their transcriptional properties diverged and E2A-HLF competitively inhibited activation by wild-type PAR proteins .
These findings establish a spectrum of binding site-specific transcriptional properties for E2A-HLF which may preferentially activate expression of select subordinate genes as a homodimer and potentially antagonize expression of others through heteromeric interactions .
Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor ( TcR ) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) production .
The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a kappa B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter , called CD28-responsive element .
Stimulation of T-cells by agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) - or TcR-derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B .
Here we report that CD28 engagement , however , exerts opposite effects on the transcription factor AP-1 .
Whereas anti-CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans-activation activity of NF-kappa B , PMA-induced activation of AP-1 was significantly suppressed .
The inhibitory effect exerted by anti-CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter-gene assays .
These results suggest that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T-cell activation .
The induction of the AP-1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation .
We have examined the possibility that stimulation of phospholipase D ( PLD ) may regulate activation of transcription factor AP-1 in human T cells by transfecting human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells with a plasmid containing an AP-1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
We have detected activatable PLD in Jurkat cells , and we have found that addition of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the physiologic product of PLD action on phospholipids , is rapidly incorporated into Jurkat cells and leads to activation of transcription factor AP-1 .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 mAb activated both PLD and transcription factor AP-1 .
Wortmannin , an inhibitor of receptor-coupled PLD activation , blocked the anti-CD3-induced increases in both PLD activity and AP-1 enhancer activity .
We found a good correlation in the transfected cells between PLD activation and induction of AP-1 enhancer activity under different experimental conditions .
Furthermore , ethanol , an inhibitor of the PLD pathway , blocked the anti-CD3-stimulated AP-1 enhancer activity .
However , this anti-CD3-mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis .
The increases in AP-1 enhancer activity induced by PA or anti-CD3 mAb were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol , an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C ( PKC ) .
Furthermore , the PA- and the anti-CD3-induced increases in AP-1 enhancer activity were blocked by the presence of PKC inhibitors or by PKC down-regulation .
These data indicate that PLD stimulation can activate the transcription factor AP-1 in T lymphocytes , and suggest that the induction of AP-1 enhancer factor activity by PA is mediated via PKC stimulation , either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA-derived diacylglycerol formation .
These data also provide evidence for a role of PLD-derived lipids in the induction of AP-1 enhancer activity resulting from stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex , suggesting that increased PLD activity can play an important role in T lymphocyte activation .
IL-8 , a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes , is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types , including T cells .
Stimulation of the CD28 cell surface molecule delivers costimulatory signals essential for lymphokine production in activated T cells via a conserved sequence element found in the promoter of several lymphokine genes .
Anti-CD28-stimulated T cells produced significant amounts of IL-8 ; additionally , costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs resulted in a synergistic induction of IL-8 secretion .
Sequence homology , single nucleotide mutations , and anti-CD28 Ab stimulation studies established that the NF-kappa B-like sequence in the promoter of the IL-8 gene functioned as a CD28 response element .
Furthermore , cyclosporin A , but not rapamycin , blocked the synergistic induction of IL-8 expression achieved with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 costimulation .
The involvement of a CD28 response element in the induction of IL-8 expression in activated T cells may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and persistence of immune disorders characterized by increased levels of IL-8 , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis .
Mental retardation and a constellation of congenital malformations not usually associated with Turner syndrome are seen in some females with a mosaic 45,X/46,X,r(X) karyotype .
Studies of these females show that the XIST locus on their tiny ring X chromosomes is either not present or not expressed .
As XIST transcription is well correlated with inactivation of the X chromosome in female somatic cells and spermatogonia , nonexpression of the locus even when it is present suggests that these chromosomes are transcriptionally active .
We examined the transcriptional activity of ring X chromosomes lacking XIST expression ( XISTE- ) , from three females with severe phenotypes .
The two tiny ring X chromosomes studied with an antibody specific for the acetylated isoforms of histone H4 marking transcribed chromatin domains were labeled at a level consistent with their being active .
We also examined tow of the XISTE- ring chromosomes to determine whether genes that are normally silent on an inactive X are expressed from these chromosomes .
Analyses of hybrid cells show that TIMP , ZXDA , and ZXDB loci on the proximal short arm , and AR and PHKA1 loci on the long arm , are well expressed from the tiny ring X chromosome lacking XIST DNA .
Studies of the ring chromosome that has XIST DNA but does not transcribe it show that its AR allele is transcribed along with the one on the normal X allele .

Mouse thymoma line EL-4 cells produce cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-10 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
EL-4 cells also produce low levels of IL-5 when stimulated by PMA alone ; however , cAMP greatly augments PMA-dependent IL-5 production .
A transient transfection assay revealed that two signals , PMA and cAMP , are required for optimal activation of the IL-5 promoter .
In contrast , cAMP almost completely inhibited the PMA-dependent activation of the endogenous IL-2 gene , as well as the transfected IL-2 promoter .
These results indicate that the IL-5 gene is positively regulated by cAMP in a manner opposite to that for the IL-2 gene .
One of the nuclear factors ( NFs ) that regulates the response of the IL-5 promoter to cAMP and PMA has properties similar to NF for activated t cell .
The P sequence of the IL-4 gene , defined as a responsive element for PMA and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , shares sequence similarity with the NF kappa B and the NF-activated T cell binding sites .
We attempted to determine whether NF(P) , a nuclear factor specific for the P sequence , is related to NF-kappa B and nuclear factor for activated T cell ( NF-AT ) .
In electromobility shift assays both NF-kappa B ( P65 or P65/P50 heterodimer ) and NF-AT bound to the P sequence .
However , sequence specificity of NF-AT was more similar to that of NF(P) , and only a small amount of P65 was detected in NF(P) .
These results indicate that a component or components of NF-AT have the potential to reconstitute NF(P) , whereas NF-kappa B alone does not account for NF(P) in Jurkat crude extract .
Taken together , these results suggest that NF-AT-like factors are involved in the regulation of IL-4 and IL-5 genes .
The eukaryotic transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) participates in many parts of the genetic program mediating T lymphocyte activation and growth .
Nuclear expression of NF-kappa B occurs after its induced dissociation from its cytoplasmic inhibitor I kappa B alpha .
Phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induction of nuclear NF-kappa B is associated with both the degradation of performed I kappa B alpha and the activation of I kappa B alpha gene expression .
Transfection studies indicate that the I kappa B alpha gene is specifically induced by the 65-kilodalton transactivating subunit of NF-kappa B .
Association of the newly synthesized I kappa B alpha with p65 restores intracellular inhibition of NF-kappa B DNA binding activity and prolongs the survival of this labile inhibitor .
Together , these results show that NF-kappa B controls the expression of I kappa B alpha by means of an inducible autoregulatory pathway .
The myeloid integrin CD11b is expressed selectively on the surface of mature macrophages , monocytes , neutrophils , and natural killer cells .
Lineage-specific expression is controlled at the level of mRNA transcription .
Recent isolation of the CD11b promoter shows that 92 base pairs ( bp ) of 5'-flanking DNA are sufficient to direct myeloid-specific expression of a reporter gene .
To characterize regulatory sequences important for promoter activity , we performed linker scanning analysis of the 92-bp CD11b promoter and demonstrate that a sequence at bp -60 is essential for CD11b promoter activity .
We show that this sequence binds the transcription factor Sp1 in vitro and in vivo .
In vivo the Sp1 site is bound only in myeloid ( U937 ) cells , not in cervical carcinoma ( HeLa ) cells .
In addition , the macrophage transcription factor PU.1 binds the CD11b promoter in vitro and in vivo close to the Sp1 site .
We propose a model in which binding of a myeloid-specific factor ( PU.1 ) allows a general factor ( Sp1 ) to bind in a tissue-specific fashion thereby contributing to the myeloid-specific expression of CD11b .
We have demonstrated earlier that the crosslinkage of the CD3/TCR complex with the CD2 antigen results in the proliferation of normal human T cells .
The effect of this synergism was perceptible at the level of induction of the IL-2 gene , a process critical for T cell growth .
To further understand the molecular and nuclear basis for this synergism , we have explored the induction of DNA-binding proteins in highly purified normal human T cells signaled via the CD3 and/or CD2 proteins .
The effect of transmembrane signaling of T cells with ionomycin , and/or sn-1,2 dioctanoyl glycerol , was also determined .
The emergence of nuclear binding proteins was investigated using interleukin-2 sequence specific oligonucleotide probes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Our studies demonstrate for the first time that CD3 antigen-derived signals and CD2 antigen-derived signals are synergistic in inducing the emergence of transcription factors that bind to the NF-AT1 , AP-1 , and NF-kB sites located in the promoter/enhancer region of the IL-2 gene .
Moreover , cyclosporine , at concentrations readily accomplished in clinical practice , was found to inhibit the emergence of these DNA-binding proteins in normal human T cells signaled via cell surface proteins implicated in antigen-dependent T cell activation and in T cells stimulated by mobilization of cellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C .
Interferon regulatory factor 2 ( IRF-2 ) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1 .
In this study , we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF-2 gene , determined the intron-exon structure of the human IRF-2 gene , mapped the major transcription initiation site , identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region , and localized the IRF-2 gene on human chromosome 4 .
The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island , with several GC boxes , a putative NF-kappa B-binding site , and a CAAT box , but no TATA box .
When the promoter region was linked with a heterologous reporter gene , we found that the promoter region is inducible by both interferons ( interferon-alpha and -gamma ) and interferon regulatory factor 1 .
The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5' to the major transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated promoter of IRF-2 .
This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1 , interferon beta , and interferon-inducible genes .
These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway , but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2 .
Human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus , and in vitro , it can productively infect human CD4+ T cells as HIV-1 .
Co-infection of T cells by HIV-1 and HHV-6 can lead to both activation of the HIV-1 promoter and acceleration of the cytopathic effects .
An HHV-6 ( GS ) cDNA clone , pCD41 , encoding for a 41-kDa nuclear protein was identified and characterized previously ( Chang and Balachandran , J. Virol . 65 , 2884-2894 and 7085 , 1991 ) .
Sequence analyses show that this protein has significant homology with the human cytomegalovirus UL44 gene coding for the ICP36 family of early-late-class phosphoprotein .
Using this cDNA as the probe , a 3.8-kb EcoRI genomic fragment encoding the HHV-6 ( GS ) P41 was cloned and designated as pGD41 .
When cotransfected with the HIV LTR CAT into CV-1 cells , both the pCD41 and pGD41 clones trans-activated the HIV LTR .
Sequence analyses of pCD41 indicate that there are two potential open reading frames ( ORFs ) , A and B , which are homologous to the ORFs found in the genomic clone pGD41 .
Deletion constructs of the pCD41 clone demonstrated that ORF-A was critical for the HIV LTR activation .
Deletion analyses of the pCD41 ORF-A and the use of promoter constructs further mapped an internal functional promoter within the pCD41 sequence that can direct the synthesis of the trans-activating protein .
By using HIV LTR deletion mutants , the NF-kappa B binding sites were found to be critical for response to the pCD41 trans-activation .
We recently confirmed the existence of gelatinase granules as a subpopulation of peroxidase-negative granules by double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy on intact cells and by subcellular fractionation .
Further characterization of gelatinase granules has been hampered by poor separation of specific and gelatinase granules on both two-layer Percoll gradients and sucrose gradients .
We have developed a three-layer Percoll density gradient that allows separation of the different granules and vesicles from human neutrophils ; in particular , it allows separation of specific and gelatinase granules .
This allows us to characterize these two granule populations with regard to their content of membrane proteins , which become incorporated into the plasma membrane during exocytosis .
We found that gelatinase granules , defined as peroxidase-negative granules containing gelatinase but lacking lactoferrin , contain 50 % of total cell gelatinase , with the remaining residing in specific granules .
Furthermore , we found that 20 % to 25 % of both the adhesion protein Mac-1 and the NADPH-oxidase component cytochrome b558 is localized in gelatinase granules .
Although no qualitative difference was observed between specific granules and gelatinase granules with respect to cytochrome b558 and Mac-1 , stimulation of the neutrophil with FMLP resulted in a selective mobilization of the least dense peroxidase-negative granules , ie , gelatinase granules , which , in concert with secretory vesicles , furnish the plasma membrane with Mac-1 and cytochrome b558 .
This shows that gelatinase granules are functionally important relative to specific granules in mediating early inflammatory responses .
Senescent human T lymphocyte cultures are unable to undergo proliferation , but show no difference from early passage cells in cytotoxic function or surface antigenic profile .
A second feature of senescent T cells is the dramatic reduction in hsp70 production in response to heat shock .
This decline is associated with a decrease in binding of nuclear extracts to the consensus heat shock element .
Interestingly , the progressive decline in the heat shock response of cultured T cells correlates with the percent proliferative life span completed rather than with the actual proliferative activity at the time of heat shock .
This suggests that for senescent T cells the reduced ability to respond to heat shock by producing hsp70 , although possibly lying at the level of transcriptional control , may nevertheless be unrelated to the reduced DNA synthesis or the diminished proliferative activity also manifested by these cells .
Two cis-acting elements GM-kappa B/GC-box and CLE0 , of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene are required for maximal induction in Jurkat T cells by costimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and Ca2+ ionophore ( A23187 ) .
The GM-kappa B sequence is recognized by NF-kappa B , which is mainly induced by PMA .
The CLE0 sequence interacts with factors , related to a PMA-induced AP-1 and a PMA/A23187-induced NF-AT .
We examined whether signal transducing components in T cells can activate transcription of the GM-CSF gene .
Cotransfection of NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) - or AP-1 ( c-Jun/c-Fos ) - expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter .
In contrast , cotransfection with a combination of NF-kappa B and AP-1 significantly augmented transcription from the GM-CSF promoter containing the GM-kappa B/GC-box and the CLE0 ( AP-1/NF-AT ) .
Expression of a constitutively active calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by NF-kappa B/AP-1 .
Both constitutively active forms of CN and protein kinase C ( PKC ) synergistically activated transcription from the GM-CSF promoter .
These results suggest that cooperation among NF-kappa B- , AP-1- and NF-AT-binding sequences is required for induction of the GM-CSF gene through PKC- and Ca2+- signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation .
Androgen binding sites have been identified in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes of healthy donors of both sexes .
Cells were separated from blood samples on a Ficoll gradient and incubated with different concentrations of [3H]testosterone in the presence or absence of a 400-fold excess of unlabelled testosterone .
Binding data were derived from Scatchard analysis .
The binding sites fulfil the required criteria for specific steroid binding sites however differ somewhat from the classic androgen receptors from genital skin fibroblast : in fertile adult males ( n = 20 ) the binding sites showed ( 1 ) a high affinity for testosterone ( 1.32 +/- 0.49 nM ; mean +/- SD ) , ( 2 ) a saturable capacity ( 184 +/- 52 binding sites per cell ; mean +/- SD ) , and ( 3 ) a characteristic competitive binding profile for other steroid hormones ( relative binding affinities : testosterone = dihydrotestosterone > 17 beta-estradiol > progesterone , whereas aldosterone , 17-hydroxy-progesterone and cortisol did not compete appreciably ) .
Furthermore the number of binding sites determined using [3H]dihydrotestosterone , [3H]RU-1881 , or [3H]testosterone were comparable .
This raises the possibility that androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes differ from those in genital skin fibroblasts .
There was no apparent correlation between serum testosterone concentrations and androgen binding sites .
In fertile women remarkable changes in androgen binding sites were seen in the course of the menstrual cycle , with a significant increase in the immediate preovulatory period .
The presence of androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes provides for the first time the experimental basis for an hypothesis of direct , receptor-mediated effects of androgens on mature immunocompetent cells .
The immunological implications of these results are discussed .
Cytogenetic studies of the primate Y chromosomes have suggested that extensive rearrangements have occurred during evolution of the great apes .
We have used in situ hybridization to define these rearrangements at the molecular level .
pHU-14 , a probe including sequences from the sex determining gene SRY , hybridizes close to the early replicating pseudoautosomal segment in a telomeric or subtelomeric position of the Y chromosomes of all great apes .
The low copy repeat detected by the probe Fr35-II is obviously included in Y chromosomal rearrangements during hominid evolution .
These results , combined with previous studies , suggest that the Y chromosome in great apes has a conserved region including the pseudoautosomal region and the testis-determining region .
The rest of the Y chromosome has undergone several rearrangements in the different great apes .
The PML/RAR alpha fusion gene resulting from the t (15;17) translocation is a specific marker for acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
We examined bone marrow cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) to detect residual PML/RAR alpha mRNA-containing cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and cytotoxic chemotherapy in a patient with APL .
This RT-PCR assay can detect one leukemic cell in 10(2) normal cells in vitro .
We show that PML/RAR alpha mRNA was still detectable despite clinical remission following ATRA treatment , but undetectable following consolidation with chemotherapy .
These data show that this technique is useful for the identification of minimal residual disease in patients with APL and that cytotoxic chemotherapy following ATRA therapy is required for the elimination of APL cells .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) negative factor ( Nef ) has been shown to down-regulate the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in vitro .
To define the mechanism of action of the Nef protein , the signal transduction pathways which may be affected in T cells by constitutive expression of the nef gene were examined .
Stimulation of T cells with tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional factors to a similar level whether or not the cells expressed the nef gene .
On the other hand , stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells not expressing the nef gene .
Because the Nef protein does not affect the surface expression of the CD3-TCR complex , we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway .
We have characterized the human gene encoding LBR , an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane .
Restriction mapping shows that the transcription unit spans approximately 35 kilobases .
A transcription start site is located approximately 4 kilobases 5' to the translation initiation codon , and an RNA splice of 3863 bases occurs in the 5'-untranslated region to generate mature HeLa cell mRNA .
5' to the identified transcription start site are two CCAAT sequences and potential recognition sites for several transcription factors including Sp1 , AP-1 , AP-2 , and NF-kB .
There are 13 protein coding exons in the LBR gene .
LBR 's nucleoplasmic domain is encoded by exons 1-4 , and its hydrophobic domain , with eight putative transmembrane segments , is encoded by exons 5-13 .
The hydrophobic domain is homologous to three yeast polypeptides , suggesting that this higher eukaryotic gene could have evolved from recombination between a gene that encoded a soluble nuclear protein and a membrane protein gene similar to those in yeast .
These results are the first to demonstrate the structural organization of a vertebrate gene encoding an integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope that may be a member of a family of polypeptides conserved in evolution .
The nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a eukaryotic transcription factor .
In B cells and macrophages it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , NF-kappa B translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals .
Using neuroblastoma cell lines as models , we have shown that in neural cells NF-kappa B was present in the cytosol and translocated into nuclei as a result of TNF alpha treatment .
The TNF alpha-activated NF-kappa B was transcriptionally functional .
NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha was not correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation .
However , reagents such as nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which induce phenotypical differentiation of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line , activated NF-kappa B , but only in that particular cell line .
In a NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line , PC12 , PMA activated NF-kappa B , whereas NGF did not .
In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such as SK-N-Be(2) , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated with the lack of NF-kappa B activation .
We found , moreover , that in SK-N-Be(2) cells protein kinase C ( PKC ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a control cell line and that the low PKC enzymatic activity was due to low PKC protein expression .
NF-kappa B was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study .
Thus , NF-kappa B activation was not required for neuroblastoma cell differentiation .
Furthermore , the results obtained with TNF alpha proved that NF-kappa B activation was not sufficient for induction of neuroblastoma differentiation .
General transcription factors are required for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II .
Human cDNAs encoding subunits of these factors have been cloned and sequenced .
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , we show here that the genes encoding the TATA-box binding protein ( TBP ) , TFIIB , TFIIE alpha , TFIIE beta , RAP30 , RAP74 and the 62 kDa subunit , of TFIIH are located at the human chromosomal bands 6q26-27 , 1p21-22 , 3q21-24 , 8p12 , 13q14 , 19p13.3 and 11p14-15.1 , respectively .
This dispersed localization of a group of functionally related gene provides insights into the molecular mechanism of human genome evolution and their possible involvement in human diseases .
Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors .
In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .
Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .
However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but not the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR+2 ) .
The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .
Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .
Because leukocyte-mediated tissue damage is an important component of the pathologic picture in ischemia/reperfusion , we have sought mechanisms by which PMNs are directed into hypoxic tissue .
Incubation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) in hypoxia , PO2 approximately 14-18 Torr , led to time-dependent release of IL-8 antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for PMNs , blocked by antibody to IL-8 .
Production of IL-8 by hypoxic ECs occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of IL-8 mRNA , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased IL-8 transcription , based on nuclear run-on assays .
Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic ECs also demonstrated increased levels of mRNA for macrophage chemotactic protein-1 , another member of the chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines .
IL-8 gene induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs for the NF-kB site .
Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of IL-8 antigen compared with normoxic controls .
In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO2 approximately 30-40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissue homogenates .
In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for IP-10 , a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL-8 , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue .
Taken together , these data suggest that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leukostasis .
The promoter of the human major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant-chain gene ( Ii ) contains two NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites located at -109 to -118 ( Ii kappa B-1 ) and -163 to -172 ( Ii kappa B-2 ) from the transcription start site .
We report here that the differential function of each of these NF-kappa B/Rel sites in several distinct cell types depends on cell-specific binding of NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors .
Ii kappa B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and in the Ii-expressing T-cell line , H9 , but acts as a negative regulatory element in myelomonocytic and glia cell lines .
In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at Ii kappa B-1 in cell lines in which this site is functional as either a positive or negative regulator .
Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA-binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with negative regulation .
Ii kappa B-2 is a site of positive regulation in B-cell lines and a site of negative regulation in H9 T cells , myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines .
In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the H9 T-cell line .
Again , in vitro supershift studies indicate that the presence of p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlates with positive function whereas the presence of only p50 and p52 correlates with negative function .
This differential binding of specific NF-kappa B/Rel subunits is likely to mediate the disparate functions of these two NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites .
Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 ) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific intracellular receptors ( vitamin D3 receptors ( VDR ) ) and modulation of gene expression via hormone-activated receptor binding to regulatory regions of target genes .
These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages .
Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express VDR mRNA , activation of these cells with interleukin-4 induced VDR in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 .
As indicators of hormone-mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23 , a common B cell/monocyte surface antigen , and 24-hydroxylase .
1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet failed to modulate CD23 expression in B cells .
Furthermore , 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells , yet failed to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells .
These findings suggest that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D-dependent gene regulation .
The human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) is expressed constitutively in cells of the myeloid lineage , appearing in myeloblast cells in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia and consistently being detected in promyelocyte stage cells as well as in all later stage cells including peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes .
The human myeloid leukemia cell lines , HL-60 , U937 , and THP-1 , express similar levels of immunochemically detectable MNDA .
Although , the level of MNDA mRNA in primary monocytes is very low it was up-regulated at 6 h following the addition of interferon alpha .
The effect of interferon alpha on the MNDA mRNA is also observed in the cell lines HL-60 , U937 , and THP-1 .
The MNDA mRNA level in primary granulocytes was unaffected by addition of interferon alpha and other agents including interferon gamma , endotoxin , poly (I).poly (C) , and FMLP .
The MNDA mRNA level in the myeloid cell lines was also unaffected by the latter four agents .
Induction of differentiation in the myeloid cell lines with phorbol ester induces monocyte differentiation which was accompanied by a decrease in MNDA mRNA level .
This reduced level of mRNA could then be elevated with subsequent interferon alpha treatment .
The effects of phorbol ester on MNDA mRNA appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of MNDA mRNA and cell cycle variation in MNDA mRNA levels were not observed .
The ability of interferon alpha to up-regulate MNDA mRNA in phorbol ester treated myeloid cell lines is consistent with the observations made in primary monocytes .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
The transcription factor AP-1 is an important human mediator of the cellular response to serum , growth factors , and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate ( TPA ) .
The AP-1 complex consists of distinct protein heterodimers encoded by the proto-oncogene c-fos and c-jun mRNA whose gene expression can be induced by TPA , cyclic AMP and growth factors .
Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the pathway of TPA and protein kinase C leading to expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA .
To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species we studied the effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid ( natural thiol antioxidants ) on the expression of c-fos mRNA in human Jurkat T cells .
When cells were preincubated with dihydrolipoic acid ( 0.2 mM ) the expression of c-fos mRNA was suppressed at 30 min after stimulation of TPA ( 0.5 microM ) whereas in the case of preincubation of alpha-lipoic acid ( 0.2 microM ) , the expression was enhanced at 30 min .
These studies support the idea that superoxide anion radical plays a role in the expression of c-fos mRNA .
Mycoplasma fermentans-derived high-molecular-weight material ( MDHM ) was originally described to induce differentiation of murine thymocytes to cytolytic effector T-cells by stimulating IL-6 release from adherent cells .
This study shows that human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMo ) also respond to MDHM with increases in IL-1 beta , IL-6 and TNF alpha expression , both at the mRNA and protein level .
The induced expression of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA in the monocytic THP-1 cell line increased as quickly as in primary cells .
In contrast to PBMo , THP-1 and 14 other monocytic/myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines did not secrete measurable amounts of the cytokines upon treatment with MDHM .
IL-1 beta and IL-6 genes contain AP-1 binding sites as regulatory elements , the AP-1 protein being composed of c-jun and c-fos gene products .
In THP-1 cells c-jun mRNA expression increased after incubation with MDHM while positive c-fos expression remained unaffected .
Although these data suggest AP-1 regulated cytokine mRNA expression , results from PBMo are not in accordance with this notion .
In the primary cells MDHM-induced elevation of cytokine mRNA levels was preceded by a downregulation of c-fos expression while positive c-jun expression was not modulated .
c-myc mRNA expression , constitutively high in THP-1 cells , was induced in MDHM-stimulated PBMo .
In conclusion , MDHM-stimulated induction of cytokine mRNA expression was accompanied by different proto-oncogene responses in PBMo and THP-1 cells .
These differences may represent different regulatory pathways of the two cell systems .
Alternatively , these data support the notion that neither AP-1 nor the c-myc protein are involved in the MDHM-induced increase in IL-1 beta , IL-6 or TNF alpha mRNA levels .
Furthermore , the present results demonstrate clearly that mycoplasma products can have a profound impact on the activation status of eukaryotic cells .
A basis for differentiation therapy of leukemias is provided by knowledge of agents which induce specific lineage maturation .
All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) induces differentiation of HL60 cells to neutrophils and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia .
We observed that RA did not induced neutrophil differentiation in serum-free grown HL60 cells whereas 50 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induced maximal monocyte differentiation .
Increasing RA concentrations reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation .
Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response , but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA .
The D3 analogs MC903 , EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation .
The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency .
Twenty-four hour treatment with 10 nM RA primed cells for response to 5 nM D3 ; the reverse sequence being ineffective .
Priming with 10 nM RA , or subsequent treatment with D3 ( 5 nM ) , did not alter expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for D3 ( VDR ) , RA ( RAR alpha ) or 9-CIS RA ( RXR alpha , beta , gamma ) .
That RA promotes both neutrophil and monocyte differentiation has implications for the use of RA and D3 in treatment of leukemias and provides insight into mechanisms whereby RAR , VDR and RXR facilitate monocyte differentiation .
Some antioxidants , including butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , tetrahydropapaveroline ( THP ) , nordihydroguiauretic acid , and 10,11-dihydroxyaporphine ( DHA ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of the production of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , IL-1 beta , and IL-6 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( IC50s in the low micromolar range ) .
Inhibition of cytokine production was gene selective and not due to general effects on protein synthesis .
Inhibition of cytokine production by PBMC was observed also when other inducers were used ( staphylococci , silica , zymosan ) .
Much higher concentrations of other antioxidants -- including ascorbic acid , trolox , alpha-tocopherol , butylated hydroxytoluene , and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton -- did not affect the production of these cytokines .
The active compounds did not inhibit IL-1-induced production of IL-6 in fibroblasts , showing the cell selectivity of the effect .
Antioxidant-mediated inhibition of cytokine production was correlated with low levels of the corresponding messenger RNAs .
Nuclear run-on experiments showed that THP inhibited transcription of the IL-1 beta gene .
THP decreased the concentration of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 detected in nuclear extracts of PBMC cultured in the presence or absence of LPS .
THP and DHA markedly decreased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the circulation of mice following LPS injection .
Thus antioxidants vary widely in potency as inhibitors of the activation of transcription factors and of the transcription of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines .
Coordinate inhibition of the transcription of genes for inflammatory cytokines could provide a strategy for therapy of diseases with inflammatory pathogenesis and for septic shock .
Exposure of monocytic cells to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins and leads to the rapid induction of inflammatory gene products , including tissue factor ( TF ) .
TF is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades .
Here we report the characterization of a nuclear complex from human monocytic cells that bound to a kappa B-like site , 5'-CGGAGTTTCC-3' , in the 5'-flanking region of the human TF gene .
This nuclear complex was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the TF gene .
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but not p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers .
Base-pair substitutions in the TF site indicated that the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of NF-kappa B .
In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , the TF complex did not migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers .
Antibodies against the NF-kappa B and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the absence of p50 in the TF complex and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF kappa B-like site .
Functional studies indicated that the TF site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65 .
Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a novel kappa B-like site mediated LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells .
We investigated whether non-abortive maternal infections would compromise fetal brain development and alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA ) axis functioning when adult .
To study putative teratogenic effects of a T cell-mediated immune response versus an endotoxic challenge , 10-d-pregnant rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 x 10(8) human red blood cells ( HRBC ) or gram-negative bacterial endotoxin ( Escherichia coli LPS : 30 micrograms/kg ) .
The adult male progeny ( 3 mo old ) of both experimental groups showed increased basal plasma corticosterone levels .
In addition , after novelty stress the HRBC group , but not the LPS group , showed increased ACTH and corticosterone levels .
Both groups showed substantial decreases in mineralocorticoid ( MR ) and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) levels in the hippocampus , a limbic brain structure critical for HPA axis regulation , whereas GR concentrations in the hypothalamus were unchanged and in anterior pituitary were slightly increased .
HRBC and LPS indeed stimulated the maternal immune system as revealed by specific anti-HRBC antibody production and enhanced IL-1 beta mRNA expression in splenocytes , respectively .
This study demonstrates that a T cell-mediated immune response as well as an endotoxic challenge during pregnancy can induce anomalies in HPA axis function in adulthood .
Clinically , it may be postulated that disturbed fetal brain development due to prenatal immune challenge increases the vulnerability to develop mental illness involving inadequate responses to stress .
T lymphocyte activation and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production require at least two signals , generated by phorbol ester ( TPA ) and Ca2+ ionophore or costimulation of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and the CD28 auxiliary receptor .
We investigated how these stimuli affect mitogen activated protein ( MAP ) kinases .
Full activation of the MAP kinases that phosphorylate the Jun activation domain , JNK1 and JNK2 , required costimulation of T cells with either TPA and Ca2+ ionophore or antibodies to TCR and CD28 .
Alone , each stimulus resulted in little or no activation .
Similar to its effect on IL-2 induction , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibited the synergistic activation of JNK , and a competitive inhibitor of Jun phosphorylation by JNK inhibited IL-2 promoter activation .
By contrast , the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 were fully activated by TPA or TCR stimulation and were not affected by Ca2+ , CD28 , or CsA .
Hence , integration of signals that lead to T cell activation occurs at the level of JNK activation .
To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid ( GC ) -mediated inhibition of T cell functions , the effect of dexamethasone ( DM ) on T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) generation were studied .
Dexamethasone inhibited IL-2-induced T cell proliferation by 30 % - 88 % , relative to its concentration within the cultures .
The effect of DM on expression of IL-2R alpha ( Tac , p55 , CD25 ) and beta ( p75 ) genes in activated T cells was examined next .
In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin ( PHA-p ) and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in IL-2R alpha and a 30 % reduction in IL-2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM ( p < 0.01 ) .
Inhibition of membrane IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta expression by 10(-6) M DM was partially reversible by recombinant human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ) .
By Northern blot analysis , DM caused a comparable decrease in IL-2R alpha and in IL-2R beta mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in mitogen-stimulated T cells .
By in vitro transcription assays , DM regulated IL-2R alpha gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of IL-2R beta gene was unaffected by DM .
The mechanism of action of DM on IL-2R alpha transcription was examined by determining the mRNA levels of the p50 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , a transcription factor that stimulates IL-2R alpha gene expression .
The data indicate that 10(-6) M DM increased T cell p50 NF-kappa B mRNA levels by four-fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM .
Further , the level of nuclear proteins capable of binding to the NF-kappa B sites in activated T cells increased in response to DM .
In sum , DM regulates T cell membrane expression of IL-2R by more than one molecular mechanism .
This study examined the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication in mononuclear phagocytes ( MNP ) .
LIF induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1 .
The magnitude and time kinetics of the LIF effects were similar to interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , other cytokines known to induce HIV replication in this cell line .
To characterize mechanisms responsible for these LIF effects , levels of HIV mRNA , activation of the DNA binding protein nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB , signal transduction pathways , and potential interactions with other cytokines were analyzed .
LIF increased steady-state levels of HIV mRNA at 2.0 , 4.3 , and 9.2 kB .
This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h .
The DNA binding protein NF-kB is a central mediator in cytokine activation of HIV transcription .
NF-kB levels were higher in unstimulated U1 cells as compared to the parent cell line U937 .
In both cell lines LIF increased NF-kB activity .
Induction of NF-kB and HIV replication by cytokines are at least in part dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates .
The oxygen radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine , but not an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , inhibited LIF-induced HIV replication .
LIF induces the production of other cytokines in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by antibodies to IL-1 , TNF , or IL-6 .
These results identify LIF as a stimulus of HIV replication .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS .
To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat on interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) expression , we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system .
Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate .
IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein .
Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level .
The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect .
The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or - unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax - by cyclosporin A .
The observed increase in IL-2 levels might facilitate virus spread from or to T cells .
Furthermore , it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or , together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated , the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients .
The study of human disorders known as premature aging syndromes may provide insight into the mechanisms of cellular senescence .
The main feature of cellular senescence in vitro is cessation of cell proliferation .
Down syndrome ( DS ) and neuronal ceroid-lypofuscinosis ( NCL ) are clinically characterized by the premature onset of numerous features normally associated with human aging .
Phytohemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes derived from DS subjects showed a statistically significant diminished proliferation capacity in comparison with lymphocytes derived from NCL and healthy individuals .
We demonstrated , by applying the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , slightly impaired AP-1 DNA binding activity in NCL lymphocytes and strong in DS ones .
Our results showed that the same molecular mechanisms of proliferation cessation could exist in fibroblasts characterized by replicative senescence and in lymphocytes derived from individuals with premature aging syndromes ( Down ) .
NF-kappa B , a 50 kDa/65 kDa ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer , is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the positive regulation of various immune genes .
The aim of this study was to determine whether NF-kappa B is related to a particular cell type and/or differentiation step during immunopoiesis .
Using in situ hybridization on sections from non HIV hyperplastic lymph nodes , we found that the gene of the 105 kDa precursor of p50 was overexpressed in the light zone of germinal centers , with a network aspect , which suggested the involvement of follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) .
By immunohistochemistry , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC , confirming the involvement of FDC .
Furthermore , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of all lymphocytes .
Thus , we focused our study on isolated FDC clusters from normal tonsils .
As showed on tissue sections , we detected the p50 in both cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC .
Nuclei of lymphocytes from FDC clusters were negative .
We next studied p65 and c-Rel protein expression in FDC clusters .
p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of FDC , whereas nuclei were negative .
Furthermore , p65 was detected in the nuclei of some lymphocytes .
c-Rel protein was detected only in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and not in the nucleus and cytoplasm of FDC .
Our results indicated that , in the context of T cell-dependent B cell immunopoiesis occurring in FDC clusters , p50 is mainly related to FDC with a massive overexpression in the nuclei , whereas p65 is expressed in a scattered manner in the nuclei of lymphocytes and c-Rel protein exclusively in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from FDC clusters .
These results suggested that the two subunits of NF-kappa B and the c-Rel protein have different roles in different cell types during B cell immunopoiesis .
Using monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) and flow cytometry , we studied a variety of surface receptors on lymphocyte subpopulations of workers with moderately increased body burdens of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) and of other polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/PCDF ) , expressed here as International-Toxicity Equivalencies ( I-TE ) .
The hypothesis to be tested was whether or not humans exhibit a similar susceptibility to PCDDs/PCDFs with respect to the surface receptors found previously to respond to small doses of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) in Callithrix jacchus .
These are : helper-inducer ( memory ) T cells ( CD4+CD45R0+CD45RA-CD29highCD11a+ ) , CD20+ B cells , and cytotoxic T cells ( CD8+CD56+/CD57+ ) .
Furthermore , 68 triple-labellings with mAbs were performed on the cells of each volunteer to possibly generate further hypotheses .
It was evaluated whether any of the variables might be used as a biomarker of effects for this class of compounds .
There were two main goals : ( 1 ) to evaluate whether workers with a moderately increased PCDD/PCDF-body burden [ 25-140 ppt TCDD or 104-522 ppt I-TE in blood fat ] exhibit changes in the surface receptors of white blood cells , as observed in previous studies in non-human primates , and ( 2 ) to clarify whether persons at the upper range [ 10-23 ppt TCDD or 30-90 ppt I-TE in blood fat ] of the body burden reference values of a not particularly exposed population show detectable deviations in these immunological variables , when compared with persons at the lower and medium range [ 1-3 ppt TCDD or 9-29 ppt I-TE ] of these body burden reference values .
Regression analysis of our data revealed slight trends for some of the biomarkers ( e.g. CD45R0+ ) .
With one exception , these were all increases .
None of the alterations observed are of medical relevance .
The slight increase in the percentage of CD4+CD45R0+ cells remained significant even after covariant analysis taking age-related changes into account .
Altogether , the data do not provide any evidence to support an assumption that moderately increased body burdens of PCDDs/PCDFs in adults induce decreases in the cellular components of the human immune system .
Adult humans certainly are less susceptible to this action of PCDDs/PCDFs than adolescent Callithrix jacchus .
We report two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive renal disease .
Both patients presented with a salt-losing episode simulating adrenal insufficiency .
In one patient , transient reduction of aldosterone receptors could be documented , while in the second patient the clinical and biochemical parameters were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism .
Aldosterone receptors were normal in both patients when studied after the surgical correction of the obstruction .
The macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion from two distinct promoters in monocytes/macrophages and the placenta .
In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of multipotential progenitors to the monocyte/macrophage lineage , we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the M-CSF receptor very early during the monocyte differentiation process .
Here we demonstrate that the human monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion .
Since one of the few transcription factors which have been implicated in the regulation of monocyte genes is the macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU.1 transcription factor , we investigated whether PU.1 binds and activates the M-CSF receptor promoter .
Here we demonstrate that both in vitro-translated PU.1 and PU.1 from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the M-CSF receptor promoter just upstream from the major transcription initiation site .
Mutations in this site which eliminate PU.1 binding decrease M-CSF receptor promoter activity significantly in macrophage cell lines only .
Furthermore , PU.1 transactivates the M-CSF receptor promoter in nonmacrophage cells .
These results suggest that PU.1 plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a key macrophage growth factor .
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene has been studied extensively as a model system of transcriptional induction during T-lymphocyte activation .
The GM-CSF gene is not expressed in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the cell surface T-cell receptor .
A highly conserved 19-bp element located immediately 5' of the human GM-CSF TATA box ( bp -34 to -52 ) , herein called purine box 1 ( PB1 ) , has been shown to bind a T-cell nuclear protein complex and to be required for transcriptional induction of the GM-CSF gene following T-cell activation .
The PB1 sequence motif is highly conserved in both human and murine GM-CSF genes .
In this report , we demonstrate that the PB1 element alone confers inducibility on a heterologous promoter following transfection into human Jurkat T cells .
In addition , we identify a major PB1 nuclear protein-binding complex that is not present in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced following T-cell activation .
Sequence analysis revealed that PB1 is composed of adjacent binding sites for Ets and AP-1 transcription factors .
In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that both the Ets and AP-1 sites are required for binding of the inducible PB1 nuclear protein complex and for the transcriptional activity of this element and the GM-CSF promoter in activated T cells .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic cycle is dependent on the transcription of the BZLF1 gene .
The BZLF1 gene promoter ( Zp ) was activated by crosslinking of cell surface immunoglobulin ( Ig ) with anti-Ig antibody in B cells , even in the absence of other viral genes .
We identified several anti-Ig response elements within Zp , which were originally defined as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) response elements ( ZI repeats and ZII , an AP-1-like domain ) .
Since anti-Ig crosslinking leads to activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and an increase in intracellular calcium level , Zp was tested for the response to these cellular factors .
Treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 increased Zp activity .
When the calcium ionophore was used in conjunction with TPA , a PKC activator , the Zp induction was synergistically enhanced .
1-(5-Isoquinolinyl sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine , an inhibitor of PKC , inhibited the anti-Ig inducibility of Zp .
Calmodulin antagonists , compound R24571 and trifluoperazine , blocked the Zp activation with anti-Ig .
These findings suggest that Zp responds directly to changes in the activity of both PKC and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase .
Requirement of tyrosine kinase activation for the anti-Ig-mediated Zp activation was also demonstrated through the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin .
These cellular gene regulatory molecules induced with anti-Ig may cooperatively play an important part in achieving efficient EBV activation as seen with anti-Ig treatment in B cells .
We have previously shown that a human B lymphoma cell line , B104 , expressed surface IgM ( sIgM ) and surface IgD ( sIgD ) , and that crosslinking of sIgM and sIgD by anti-IgM antibody ( Ab ) and anti-IgD Ab , respectively , induced Ca2+ influx to almost the same degree , whereas only sIgM-crosslinking caused B104 cell death .
Here , we investigated the accumulation of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates , protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity and the induction of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression by sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking to examine differences in the signals mediated through sIgM and sIgD in B104 cells .
Both sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking with antibodies induced elevation of cAMP levels , phosphatidylinositol turnover , PKC activation and expression of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA , although sIgM-crosslinking was more effective than sIgD-crosslinking , presumably due to the higher expression of sIgM than of sIgD .
Egr-1 mRNA expression induced by sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking was inhibited by H7 , erbstatin and genistein , but not by HA1004 .
Erbstatin and genistein inhibited the sIg-crosslinking-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner parallel to that observed in the inhibition of sIg-crosslinking-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation .
Phorbol myristate acetate induced Egr-1 mRNA expression but forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not .
These findings suggest that the Egr-1 mRNA activating signals through sIgM and sIgD are protein tyrosine kinase- and PKC-dependent , but protein kinase A-independent .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 rescued B104 cells from death induced by anti-IgM Ab , but did not affect the expression of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA , showing that CsA and FK506 affect signal transducers differently from or downstream to these molecules .
The difference in signals transduced through sIgM and sIgD in B104 cells is discussed .
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a transcriptional activator that binds to sequences in the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter and is thought to be largely responsible for the T cell-specific inducibility of IL-2 expression .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that specific NFAT binding activity could also be induced in human B cells .
The B cell NFAT complex , however , was not functional , since it failed to activate transcription from an NFAT-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct .
Competition with an AP-1 motif or with anti-Jun and anti-Fos antibodies abolished binding to the NFAT motif in both T and B cells , indicating that Jun and Fos are critical for NFAT complex formation in both cell types .
Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif .
However , when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts , full-length , but not truncated , Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an NFAT complex , indicating the presence of a constitutively expressed nuclear factor ( s ) in B and T cells necessary for the formation of the NFAT complex in both cell types .
An NFAT oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the 5' purine-rich part of the NFAT sequence failed to form a complex and to compete with the wild type motif for NFAT complex formation in both T and B cells .
We therefore propose a model whereby a core NFAT complex consisting of Jun , Fos , and a constitutive nuclear factor is formed in both T and B cells , but an additional factor and/or post-translational modification of a factor , missing in B cells , might be required for transactivation by NFAT .
The enhancer for the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene ( IgH ) activates a heterologous gene at the pre-B cell stage of B lymphocyte differentiation .
A lymphoid-specific element , microB , is necessary for enhancer function in pre-B cells .
A microB binding protein is encoded by the PU.1/Spi-1 proto-oncogene .
Another sequence element , microA , was identified in the mu enhancer that binds the product of the ets-1 proto-oncogene .
The microA motif was required for microB-dependent enhancer activity , which suggests that a minimal B cell-specific enhancer is composed of both the PU.1 and Ets-1 binding sites .
Co-expression of both PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells trans-activated reporter plasmids that contained the minimal mu enhancer .
These results implicate two members of the Ets family in the activation of IgH gene expression .
Transcription factor NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor I kappa B .
Overproduced I kappa B , free from NF-kappa B , is rapidly degraded .
Overexpression of p65 increases endogenous I kappa B protein in both carcinoma and lymphoid cells by two mechanisms : protein stabilization and increased transcription of I kappa B mRNA .
In contrast , p65 delta , a naturally occurring splice variant , fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels .
Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic , whereas p65 delta is partly nuclear , indicating that the I kappa B induced by p65 can maintain NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm .
Thus , p65 and I kappa B are linked in an autoregulatory loop , ensuring that NF-kappa B is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus .
In the immune system the first activation of a naive T cell by antigen is a key step in the shaping of the peripheral T cell specificity repertoire and maintenance of self-tolerance .
In the present study , analysis of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene activation shows that naive human helper T cells ( cord blood CD4+ T cells , adult CD4+CD45RO- T cells ) regulate IL-2 transcription by a mechanism involving both a silencer and an activator acting on the purine-rich IL-2 promoter elements ( NF-AT binding sites ) .
By contrast , memory cells , either in vitro activated helper T cells reverting to a resting state , or CD4+ T ( memory ) clones , or CD4+CD45RO+ T cells isolated ex vivo , no longer have a silencer .
Their IL-2 transcription seems to be controlled solely by the transition from inactive to active functional state of a positive transcription factor binding to these promoter elements as well as its cytoplasmic or nuclear location : in resting memory T cells the activator is located in the cytoplasm and is inactive , whereas in stimulated cells it is functional in promoting transcription and now resides in the nucleus .
Thus , the regulation of the gene coding for the main T cell growth factor changes irreversibly after the first encounter of T cells with antigen .
It is most likely that the presence of a silencer contributes to the more stringent activation requirements of naive CD4+ T cells .
A family of transcriptional activating proteins , the GATA factors , has been shown to bind to a consensus motif through a highly conserved C4 zinc finger DNA binding domain .
One member of this multigene family , GATA-3 , is most abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes , a cellular target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and replication .
In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis revealed six hGATA-3 binding sites in the U3 region ( the transcriptional regulatory domain ) of the HIV-1 LTR .
Cotransfection of an hGATA-3 expression plasmid with a reporter plasmid whose transcription is directed by the HIV-1 LTR resulted in 6- to 10-fold stimulation of LTR-mediated transcription , whereas site specific mutation of these GATA sites resulted in virtual abrogation of the activation by hGATA-3 .
Further , deletion of the hGATA-3 transcriptional activation domain abolished GATA-dependent HIV-1 trans-activation , showing that the stimulation of viral transcription observed is a direct effect of cotransfected hGATA-3 .
Introduction of the HIV-1 plasmids in which the GATA sites have been mutated into human T lymphocytes also caused a significant reduction in LTR-mediated transcription at both the basal level and in ( PHA- plus PMA- ) stimulated T cells .
These observations suggest that in addition to its normal role in T lymphocyte gene regulation , hGATA-3 may also play a significant role in HIV-1 transcriptional activation .
The in vitro effect of 17 beta-estradiol on NK activity was studied .
The proliferation and NK activity of YT-N17 ( a human NK-like cell line ) were enhanced by 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , and the enhancement was blocked by tamoxifen ( Tx ) , an antagonist of E2 .
On the contrary , other steroid hormones such as Tx , progesterone , and testosterone had no effect .
YT-N17 contained 11.8 fmol/mg protein of estrogen receptor ( mean of two independent assays ) , a value which was 5-10-fold higher than that of other hematopoietic cell lines .
An enhancement of NK activity by E2 was also seen in large granular lymphocytes obtained from normal subjects , and it was again suppressed by Tx .
These data suggest that E2 is one of the activating factors for NK/LGL cells .
Optimal activation of T cells requires at least two signals .
One signal can be delivered by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor , and the second signal is provided by the costimulatory molecule ( s ) delivered by the antigen-presenting cell .
CD28 is a T-cell surface molecule and stimulation through this protein plays an important role in delivering the second activation signal .
In this report , we show that in human peripheral blood T cells , CD28-mediated signal transduction involves the rel family proteins -- c-Rel , p50 , and p65 .
Treatment of peripheral blood T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) results in augmentation of nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 , and this augmentation can occur in the presence of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A .
It is also shown in this report that , in response to PMA/anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb , c-Rel , p50 , and p65 are associated with CD28-responsive element present in the promoter of the human interleukin 2 gene .
The functional significance of c-Rel involvement in the CD28-responsive complex is demonstrated by transient transfection analysis , where cotransfection of c-Rel augments the level of expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the CD28-responsive element .
Pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) is a frequent cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality .
In the present study we focused on the pathophysiology of PIH , mainly on the role of mineralocorticoids , reversed blood pressure patterns , and the resulting necessity of continuous monitoring of the preeclamptic mother .
Problems of antihypertensive therapy are discussed and the first results of a pilot study with Urapidil are presented .
To examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of PIH , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxy-corticosterone ( 18-OH-B ) levels in 25 women with PIH and in 25 healthy pregnant women .
Furthermore , we evaluated the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) count in mononuclear leukocytes in the 2 groups .
The MR-count was significantly decreased in the PIH-group .
The values of plasma aldosterone and 18-OH-B were also low .
These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher level of mineralocorticoids of the zona glomerulosa .
Perhaps deoxycorticosterone or a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid is responsible for the hypertension and altered MR-status .
The first results of continuous blood pressure measurements with a noninvasive , real-time blood pressure monitor ( Finapres ) are presented .
The comparison of the obtained values with intraarterial measurements demonstrates a good correlation between the two methods .
We also report on the first experiences with Urapidil in the treatment of hypertension in severe preeclampsia .
The data show that hypertension in preeclamptic women can be treated by Urapidil without side effects or reflex-tachycardia .
Further studies will have to prove if Urapidil is suited for prepartal treatment of PIH as well .
The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd ( TNFRp55 ) and 75 kd ( TNFRp75 ) .
Using gene targeting , we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain .
Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules .
Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered , and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired .
However , TNF signaling is largely abolished , as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice .
The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B .
In contrast , TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection .
Thus , the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host 's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors .
The replicative form of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) DNA was studied using two lymphoblastoid cell lines , X50-7 and 6F11 , which are latently infected by Epstein-Barr virus .
The lytic cycle of EBV infection was induced by transfection of the cells with the BRLF1/BZLF1 coding region of the P3HR-1 defective genome .
We combined two techniques to identify the productive replicative form of Epstein-Barr viral DNA in the lytic cycle-induced cells .
Restriction enzyme analysis followed by Southern blot hybridization identified a significant increase in the fused fragment encompassing both ends of EBV DNA .
This indicates an increase in either episomal DNA or concatameric linear DNA .
Southern blot analysis of in situ lysing gels revealed that the cellular content of linear EBV DNA was also increased significantly after the initiation of the viral lytic cycle , while the amount of circular DNA remained approximately constant .
We propose from these results that the source of the fused fragment encompassing both ends of EBV DNA is a concatenated linear EBV DNA molecule , and that such a concatenated molecule most likely represents a replicative form of EBV DNA in productively infected cells .
Previous studies have demonstrated that human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells differentiate in response to phorbol esters .
This event is associated with induction of the c-jun early response gene and appearance of a monocytic phenotype .
The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected , multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced HL-60 cell differentiation .
The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells , designated HL-60/vinc , fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation .
By contrast , treatment of HL-60/vinc cells with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases , induces c-jun transcription , growth arrest , and expression of the c-fms gene .
Studies were also performed with an HL-60/vinc revertant ( HL-60/vinc/R ) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine .
The finding that HL-60/vinc/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype , but not c-jun expression , suggests that c-jun induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation .
Other studies further demonstrate that the jun-B and fra-1 genes are induced by TPA in both HL-60/vinc and HL-60/vinc/R cells , whereas c-fos expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line .
Since TPA activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , we examined translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction .
Although HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells demonstrated translocation of PKC activity , this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in HL-60/vinc cells .
Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells , but not in response to okadaic acid .
Taken together , these findings suggest that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and can include defects in PKC-mediated signaling events and induction of jun/fos early response gene expression .
The Fc epsilon RI-gamma chains are expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells where they play a critical role in signal transduction .
They are part of the high affinity IgE receptor in mast cells , basophils , Langerhans cells , and possibly other cells ; a component of the low affinity receptor for IgG ( Fc gamma RIIIA or CD16 ) in natural killer cells and macrophages ; and part of the T cell antigen receptor in subsets of T cells .
Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the gamma chain gene by analyzing the 2.5-kilobase sequence upstream of the transcription start site .
This sequence contains a promoter specific to cells of hematopoietic lineage .
However , the tissue specificity of this promoter is only partial because it is active in all of the hematopoietic cells tested here , regardless of whether they constitutively express Fc epsilon RI- gamma chain transcripts .
We have identified two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements , both of which are part of an Alu repeat .
The first ( -445/-366 ) is a positive element active in both basophils and T cells .
The second ( -365/-264 ) binds to nuclear factors , which appear to be different in basophils and T cells , and acts as a negative element in basophils and as a positive one in T cells .
Thus , this Alu repeat ( 90 % identical to Alu consensus sequences ) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator .
The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) and the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 , both of which are highly conserved in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates .
To delineate the effects of these motifs on the replicative capacity of HIV and to explore the possibility of extending the virus host range , known heterologous enhancer/promoters were inserted into the HIV-1 LTR in place of the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites .
The effects of these substitutions on viral replication in transfected HeLa cells and on HIV infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes or continuous T-leukemia cell lines were evaluated .
HIVs in which the NF- kappa B/Sp1 enhancer plus the downstream TATA element were replaced with heterologous enhancer/promoters were also constructed .
Viruses containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer exhibited infectious kinetics similar to that of wild-type HIV in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and AA2 cells but replicated less efficiently in H9 and CEM cells .
These studies indicate that heterologous enhancer elements are capable of restoring Tat responsiveness to the HIV LTR in the context of directing reporter gene expression as well as in the production of infectious progeny virions .
Ionizing radiation triggers a signal in human B-lymphocyte precursors that is intimately linked to an active protein-tyrosine kinase regulatory pathway .
We show that in B-lymphocyte precursors , irradiation with gamma-rays leads to ( i ) stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover ; ( ii ) downstream activation by covalent modification of multiple serine-specific protein kinases , including protein kinase C ; and ( iii ) activation of nuclear factor kappa B .
All of the radiation-induced signals were effectively prevented by the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A .
Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation is an important and perhaps mandatory proximal step in the activation of the protein kinase C signaling cascade in human B-lymphocyte precursors .
Our report expands current knowledge of the radiation-induced signaling cascade by clarifying the chronological sequence of biochemical events that follow irradiation .
We studied the effect of interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of two immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun .
These genes encode proteins that form the dimeric complex activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , which is active as a transcriptional factor .
Maximal accumulation of either c-fos and c-jun messenger RNA ( mRNA ) occurred 30 minutes after LPS addition .
When cells were treated with IL-4 for 5 hours before LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA expression was decreased .
The inhibition of c-fos and c-jun expression by IL-4 in LPS-treated cells was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
IL-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts .
Finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that IL-4 inhibits LPS-induced expression of AP-1 protein .
These data indicate that IL-4 suppresses the induction of transcription factors in human activated monocytes .
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) and HTLV-II Tax proteins are potent transactivators of viral and cellular gene expression .
Using deletion mutants , the downstream parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) promoter is shown to be responsive to both HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax as well as the AP1/c-jun proto-oncogene .
Transactivation of PTHrP by Tax was seen in T cells but not in B-cell lines or fibroblasts .
A carboxy terminal Tax deletion mutant was deficient in transactivation of both the PTHrP and IL2R alpha promoters but not the HTLV-I long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Exogenous provision of NFkB rescued IL2R alpha expression but not the PTHrP promoter .
Thus , HTLV-I Tax , HTLV-II Tax , and c-jun transactivate PTHrP and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in adult T-cell leukemia .
Interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is exclusively expressed by activated T and natural killer cells , a function that is tightly controlled both in a lineage-specific and in a stimulation-dependent manner .
We have investigated the protein binding characteristics and functional importance of the ACT-1-activating region of the IL-3 promoter .
This region binds an inducible , T-cell-specific factor over its 5' end , a site that is necessary for the expression of IL-3 in the absence of other upstream elements .
Over its 3' end , it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed .
This factor is Oct-1 or an immunologically related octamer-binding protein , and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several regulatory elements .
These characteristics make the ACT-1 site analogous to the activating ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter .
Furthermore , and despite a lack of sequence homology , the promoters of IL-3 and IL-2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes .
In a Jurkat cell model of T-cell activation an interleukin-2 promoter/reporter gene construct was activated by antigen receptor agonism in combination with the lymphokine interleukin-1 .
Antigen receptor signals could be mimicked by suboptimal activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) with phorbol esters in combination with calcium mobilization by an ionophore .
In cotransfection experiments , oncogenic rats obviated the need for PKC stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or interleukin-1 .
Activated ras expression also replaced the requirement for PKC stimulation in activation of the T-cell transcription factor NF-AT .
A dominant inhibitory ras mutant specifically blocked antigen receptor agonism , indicating that ras activity is required for antigen receptor signaling .
In addition , an inhibitor of PKC blocked both activated ras and phorbol ester stimulation , suggesting a role for ras upstream of PKC .
The X box region is critical for directing the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes in B lymphocytes .
Although several class II promoter-specific DNA binding factors have been described , only the X box region factor , RFX , shows a genetic correlation with class II expression , being deficient in some B cell lines derived from patients with class II-deficient congenital immunodeficiency .
To further evaluate the role of X box DNA-binding proteins in class II gene expression , the role of the X box region was examined in both class II-positive and -negative lymphoid cells .
In addition to the wild-type B cell line Raji , two class II transcriptional mutant cell lines , SJO and RJ2.2.5 , and Jurkat , a class II negative T cell line , were examined .
In contrast to wild-type B cells , neither of the class II mutant cell lines could use the X box region to direct the expression of a transiently transfected reporter gene , indicating that the X box-dependent transcriptional pathway is defective in these cells .
The binding activity of the X1 box DNA-binding protein RFX was examined and found to be present in wild-type B cells and the mutant RJ2.2.5 but was absent in SJO and Jurkat .
However , other X1 box-specific activities were detected in all these cell lines .
To determine whether these different X1 box activities represented distinct DNA binding proteins or multimeric forms of the same factor ( s ) , protease treatment of the crude nuclear extracts followed by DNA-binding assays were carried out and demonstrated that B cell extracts contain at least two X1-specific factors .
One of these cleaved products ( band 1 pk ) correlates with RFX activity .
A similar comparison with protease-treated extracts prepared from Jurkat cells demonstrated the presence of the band 1pk activity despite an absence of the native RFX activity .
In contrast , protease treatment and analysis of SJO extracts showed no detectable levels of the band 1pk activity .
These results demonstrate that multiple X1 box-specific DNA-binding activities exist in all lymphoid cells , but the presence of an actively binding RFX species correlates with class II transcription .
In previous transfection analyses using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene system , we determined that linker substitution ( LS ) mutations between -201 and -130 ( relative to the transcription start site ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) caused moderate decreases in LTR transcriptional activity in a T-cell line ( S.L.Zeichner , J.Y.H. Kim , and J.C.Alwine , J.Virol. 65 : 2436-2444 , 1991 ) .
In order to confirm the significance of this region in the context of viral replication , we constructed several of these LS mutations ( -201 to - 184 , -183 to -166 , -165 to -148 , and -148 to -130 ) in proviruses and prepared viral stocks by cocultivation of transfected RD cells with CEMx174 cells .
In addition , two mutations between -93 and -76 and between -75 and -58 were utilized , since they affect the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) - and Sp1-binding sites and were expected to diminish viral replication .
Our results suggest that while transfection analyses offer an adequate approximation of the effects of the LS mutations , the analysis of viral replication using a mutant viral stock presents a more accurate picture , which is sometimes at variance with the transfection results .
Three mutants ( -201/-184 NXS , -165/-148 NXS , and -147/-130 NXS ) had effects on viral replication that were much more severe than the effects predicted from their performance in transfection analyses , and the effects of two LS mutations ( -201/-184 NXS and -183/-166 NXS ) were not predicted by their effects in transfection .
In addition , we observed cell type-specific permissiveness to replication of some mutant viruses .
In the cell types tested , the LS mutations indicated an apparent requirement not only for the intact NF-kappa B and SP1-binding sites but also for several regions between -201 and -130 not previously associated with viral infectivity .
The expression of thrombospondin 1 ( TSP 1 ) , a member of the TSP gene family , is rapidly induced by growth factors .
We tested the ability of human TSP 1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs to respond to serum in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells .
Two transcriptional elements in the TSP 1 promoter , a distal element at -1280 and a proximal element at -65 , were required for the response of the human TSP 1 gene to serum .
The distal element contains the 5'-CC(A + T)6GG-3' consensus sequence characteristic of a serum-response element ( SRE ) .
Deletions or mutations in this element reduced the serum response of the TSP 1 gene by 80-90 % .
In gel-shift assays , the -1280 element and the c-fos SRE cross-competed , whereas their functional and binding mutants did not .
The proximal element contains the sequence 5'-GGCCAATGGG-3' , which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y ( CBF , CP1 , alpha CP1 ) .
Deletions or mutations in this element also reduced the serum response by 80-90 % .
Methylation interference analysis of the -65 region identified a pattern of contacts with nuclear factors resembling that for NF-Y , and an NF-Y-binding site and the proximal TSP 1 element cross-competed in gel-shift assays , whereas their binding mutants did not .
Finally , an abbreviated TSP 1 promoter/5'-flank , containing the SRE- and NF-Y-binding sites , mediated a serum response that was close in magnitude to that of the parent promoter .
We conclude that the serum response of the human TSP 1 gene requires the coordinated function of an SRE- and NF-Y-binding site .
Numerous studies have shown that , upon HIV1 infection , human promonocytic U937 cells were induced to differentiate , as indicated , for example , by increased expression of adhesion molecules .
One of the viral proteins involved in this process might be the Tat protein .
Indeed , this viral protein , which is essential for productive infection , has also been shown to display growth-stimulating properties and immunomodulatory activities .
In order to apprehend the role of the HIV1 tat gene in inducing the differentiation of HIV1-infected U937 cells , we have successfully introduced this gene into U937 cells by infecting them with retroviral particles transducing tat .
The effect of the Tat protein constitutively expressed by these cells upon their differentiation was then evaluated by looking for the expression of the c-fos and of the c-fms proto-oncogenes which are linked to the differentiation of myelomonoblastic cells .
Northern blot analysis revealed in these cells , an increase in the transcription of these two proto-oncogenes , and this increase was amplified after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate .
No such increase was observed in control U937 cells .
These results indicate that , among HIV1 gene products , the Tat protein appears to trigger monocytic differentiation , and suggests that this viral protein directs progenitors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage towards a differentiation stage in which production of viral antigens and virions might be more efficient .
Target antigens defined by autoantibodies in IDDM include insulin , a putative glycolipid that reacts with islet cell antibodies , and a 64,000-M(r) protein recently identified as glutamic acid decarboxylase .
In addition , some IDDM sera that contain antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase also coprecipitate a 38,000-M(r) protein from islets .
This study used a high titer anti-38,000-M(r) serum to screen bacteriophage lambda cDNA expression libraries and identified human islet and placental clones encoding jun-B , the nuclear transcription protein , of predicted 38,000 M(r) .
Peripheral blood T-cells exhibited significant proliferation in response to a recombinant fragment of jun-B ( amino acids 1-180 ) in 12 of 17 ( 71 % ) recent-onset IDDM subjects , 8 of 16 ( 50 % ) ICA-positive first-degree relatives of IDDM subjects who were at risk , 3 of 12 ( 25 % ) other autoimmune disease subjects , and 0 of 10 healthy control subjects .
Proliferation to tetanus toxoid did not differ significantly between the groups .
Responses to jun-B were not related to age , sex , or human leukocyte antigen status .
Thus , autoreactive T-cells identify a novel antigen , p38 jun-B , in IDDM and appear to indicate subjects at risk for the development of clinical disease .
We studied the functional interaction between human embryonic zeta 2 globin promoter and the alpha globin regulatory element ( HS-40 ) located 40 kb upstream of the zeta 2 globin gene .
It was shown by transient expression assay that HS-40 behaved as an authentic enhancer for high-level zeta 2 globin promoter activity in K562 cells , an erythroid cell line of embryonic and/or fetal origin .
Although sequences located between -559 and -88 of the zeta 2 globin gene were dispensable for its expression on enhancerless plasmids , they were required for the HS-40 enhancer-mediated activity of the zeta 2 globin promoter .
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this HS-40 enhancer-zeta 2 globin promoter interaction is mediated by the two GATA-1 factor binding motifs located at -230 and -104 , respectively .
The functional domains of HS-40 were also mapped .
Bal 31 deletion mapping data suggested that one GATA-1 motif , one GT motif , and two NF-E2/AP1 motifs together formed the functional core of HS-40 in the erythroid-specific activation of the zeta 2 globin promoter .
Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that the enhancer function of one of the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs of HS-40 is mediated through its binding to NF-E2 but not AP1 transcription factor .
Finally , we did genomic footprinting of the HS-40 enhancer region in K562 cells , adult nucleated erythroblasts , and different nonerythroid cells .
All sequence motifs within the functional core of HS-40 , as mapped by transient expression analysis , appeared to bind a nuclear factor ( s ) in living K562 cells but not in nonerythroid cells .
On the other hand , only one of the apparently nonfunctional sequence motifs was bound with factors in vivo .
In comparison to K562 , nucleated erythroblasts from adult human bone marrow exhibited a similar but nonidentical pattern of nuclear factor binding in vivo at the HS-40 region .
These data suggest that transcriptional activation of human embryonic zeta 2 globin gene and the fetal/adult alpha globin genes is mediated by erythroid cell-specific and developmental stage-specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes which form at the enhancer ( HS-40 ) and the globin promoters .
The transactivator HTLV-I Tax activates the promoter of the gene coding for the interleukin 2 alpha-chain receptor ( IL-2R alpha ) via a kappa B site that can bind several protein species of the rel family .
Tax1 strongly activates the enhancer activity of this motif , in both epithelial HeLa and lymphoid Jurkat cells .
This activation was not observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells .
Overexpression of the p50 , p65 and Rel proteins in these cells showed that significant activation of the IL-2R alpha kappa B site was observed only with Rel and Rel plus p65 .
Moreover , whereas both Tax and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) are able to efficiently induce the binding of NF-kappa B to the IL-2R alpha kappa B site , PMA is functionally inactive .
Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay , we observed that Tax1 is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel , whereas PMA is not .
This established a clear difference between both stimuli , indicating that Rel is the functionally active factor .
We conclude from these results that the functional activity of members of the rel family is regulated by their interaction with DNA and that Rel can be a potent transcriptional activator on specific kappa B sites .
The NK-kappa B transcription factor complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein I kappa B-alpha ( MAD-3 ) .
Various cellular stimuli relieve this inhibition by mechanisms largely unknown , leading to NF-kappa B nuclear localization and transactivation of its target genes .
It is demonstrated here with human T lymphocytes and monocytes that different stimuli , including tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , cause rapid degradation of I kappa B-alpha , with concomitant activation of NF-kappa B , followed by a dramatic increase in I kappa B-alpha mRNA and protein synthesis .
Transfection studies reveal that the I kappa B-alpha mRNA and the encoded protein are potently induced by NF-kappa B and by homodimers of p65 and of c-Rel .
We propose a model in which NF-kappa B and I kappa B-alpha mutually regulate each other in a cycle : saturating amounts of the inhibitory I kappa B-alpha protein are destroyed upon stimulation , allowing rapid activation of NF-kappa B .
Subsequently , I kappa B-alpha mRNA and protein levels are quickly induced by the activated NF-kappa B .
This resurgence of I kappa B-alpha protein acts to restore an equilibrium in which NF-kappa B is again inhibited .
The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
Here we demonstrate that hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) induced K562 cells to differentiate along a third pathway .
This was accompanied by downregulation of two transcription factors normally expressed in erythroid , mast and megakaryocyte lineages .
Northern analysis demonstrated coordinate downregulation of alpha globin and gamma globin in addition to the two lineage-restricted transcription factors , SCL and GATA-1 .
Proliferation of the K562 cells was also suppressed .
Clonal assay showed that the suppression was irreversible and appeared analogous to the commitment of murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells to terminal differentiation .
In contrast to MEL cells , however , K562 cells acquired a macrophage-like morphology and exhibited a complete failure to generate benzidine-positive cells .
Electron microscopy revealed a marked increase in granules resembling those specific for eosinophils .
Surface marker analysis showed that HMBA-induced cells expressed reduced levels of glycophorin A , CD5 , CD7 and CD11b .
No upregulation of megakaryocyte or lymphoid markers occurred .
Thus the response of K562 cells to HMBA may provide a useful experimental system for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for downmodulation of lineage-restricted transcription factors during hemopoietic lineage commitment .
Endothelial cells ( EC ) act as APC for resting PBL in vitro , and may have important roles in vivo in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and delayed hypersensitivity .
We previously reported that human umbilical vein EC provide costimulatory signals to PHA-stimulated PBL via CD2:lymphocyte function-associated Ag-3 and an unidentified ligand pair , resulting in a three- to eight-fold enhancement of IL-2 production .
The physiologic relevance of this increase was demonstrated by the proliferative advantage provided by EC to PBL suboptimally stimulated with mAb OKT3 .
We now report that EC costimulation causes increased levels of IL-2 mRNA as a result of increased IL-2 transcription in PBL .
We therefore examined the effects of EC on T cell nuclear factors known to regulate IL-2 transcription , including c-jun and c-fos-two components of the transcription factor AP-1 , NFAT , and others .
PBL constitutively express c-jun transcripts , and the level of c-jun mRNA is not altered by PHA activation in the absence or presence of EC .
In contrast , c-fos mRNA is absent from resting T cells and is induced on PHA activation .
EC alone do not induce c-fos mRNA but augment the level of c-fos mRNA in PHA-activated T cells by 3- to 10-fold .
This effect is largely independent of the CD2:lymphocyte function-associated Ag-3 pathway .
Gel-shift analysis reveals the constitutive presence of nuclear factors in resting PBL that bind to the proximal AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter and that contain immunoreactive c-Jun but not c-Fos protein .
In contrast , AP-1 from PHA-activated cells contains c-Jun and low levels of c-Fos .
Strikingly , costimulation with EC results in a dramatic increase ( up to 15-fold ) in the c-Fos content of AP-1 .
Levels of other nuclear factors involved in IL-2 regulation were not altered by EC , although NFAT-DNA complexes migrated at a slightly different mobility .
In summary , our data suggest that changes in the composition of transcription factor AP-1 is a key molecular mechanism for increasing IL-2 transcription and may underlie the phenomenon of costimulation by EC .
IL-2 gene transcription is affected by several nuclear proteins .
We asked whether dexamethasone ( Dex ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibit IL-2 gene transcription by interfering with the activity of nuclear proteins that bind to the IL-2 promoter .
Nuclear extracts from primary human T lymphocytes were analyzed by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays .
Both Dex and CsA inhibited the binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT , but not of NF-kB and OCT-1/OAF , to their corresponding sites on the IL-2 gene promoter .
To correlate changes in nuclear factor binding in vitro with transcriptional activity in vivo and define the structural requirements for IL-2 promoter repression , we used transient DNA transfections .
Jurkat cells were transfected with plasmids containing either the intact IL-2 promoter or its AP-1 , NF-AT , and NF-kB motifs .
Dex inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the AP-1 , but not the NF-AT and NF-kB plasmids .
In contrast , CsA inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the NF-AT , but not the AP-1 and NF-kB plasmids .
These results suggest that in human T lymphocytes both Dex and CsA inhibited IL-2 gene transcription through interference with transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT .
We propose that , while maximum inhibition may involve interaction with both transcription factors , AP-1 is the primary target of Dex .
The assessment of synovial lymphocyte reactivity to adenovirus antigen stimulation was undertaken in patients with persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis .
The 3H-thymidine uptake procedure was employed , incorporating multiple microbiological antigens .
Five patients were found with repeated maximal responses to adenovirus antigen ; in one of these adenovirus nucleotide sequences were present in a synovial biopsy specimen .
It is concluded that adenovirus may be one cause of persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis .
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat , HIV-1-LTR , contains binding sites for several cellular transcription factors which contribute to HIV-1 gene expression .
Our previous studies on the function of the HIV-1-encoded Nef protein suggested that Nef may be an inhibitor HIV-1 transcription .
To determine whether Nef affects the binding of cellular factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation , 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from Nef-expressing T-cell lines that were not stimulated or were stimulated with T-cell mitogens .
We found that Nef inhibited the recruitment of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in mitogen-stimulated human T-cells .
Additionally , Nef expressing cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid in which HIV-1 AP-1 DNA recognition sequences were cloned downstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
Mitogen-mediated transcriptional activation of the CAT gene in this construct was inhibited in Nef-expressing cells but not in control cells .
These studies suggest that , by inhibiting AP-1 activation , Nef may play a role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression in infected T-cells .
Early B-cell factor ( EBF ) was identified previously as a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of the pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific mb-1 gene .
Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified EBF were used to isolate cDNA clones , which by multiple criteria encode EBF .
The recombinant polypeptide formed sequence-specific complexes with the EBF-binding site in the mb-1 promoter .
The cDNA hybridized to multiple transcripts in pre-B and B-cell lines , but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in plasmacytoma , T-cell , and nonlymphoid cell lines .
Expression of recombinant EBF in transfected nonlymphoid cells strongly activated transcription from reporter plasmids containing functional EBF-binding sites .
Analysis of DNA binding by deletion mutants of EBF identified an amino-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain lacking obvious sequence similarity to known transcription factors .
DNA-binding assays with cotranslated wild-type and truncated forms of EBF indicated that the protein interacts with its site as a homodimer .
Deletions delineated a carboxy-terminal dimerization region containing two repeats of 15 amino acids that show similarity with the dimerization domains of basic-helix-loop-helix proteins .
Together , these data suggest that EBF represents a novel regulator of B lymphocyte-specific gene expression .
Recently , many investigators have been interested in the study on eosinophil biology since genes association with eosinophils such as interleukin-5 or eosinophil granule proteins ( EPO , ECP , EDN , MBP , and CLC ) , were isolated .
However , the molecular basis for the commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage has not been determined .
The mechanism by which eosinophil-specific genes encoding primary and secondary granule proteins ( e.g. ECP , EDN , EPO , MBP , and CLC ) are expressed and regulated during eosinophilopoiesis is also unknown .
In this paper , I described the characterization of genes encoding eosinophil granule proteins and the mRNA expression of GATA-1 binding transcription factor during eosinophil differentiation .
The retinoblastoma gene product ( Rb ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression .
Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation .
In this report , it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo .
Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma .
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells .
After T cell activation , the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1 , which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription .
Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation .
These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor .
This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells .
Using a human TSH receptor ( TSH-R ) cDNA probe , we investigated TSH-R transcript levels in 13 human thyroid fragments by Northern blot analysis ; 7 Graves ' disease , 2 Hashimoto 's disease , 3 endemic goiter , and 1 healthy thyroid gland were studied .
TSH-R expression levels were variable , but displayed a close correlation to the expression of thyroid peroxidase ( r = 0.703 ; P < 0.05 ) , thyroglobulin ( r = 0.817 ; P < 0.01 ) , and the nuclear oncogene c-fos ( r = 0.935 ; P < 0.001 ) , but not c-myc .
Overall , TSH-R transcript levels were low or absent in those thyroids in which expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I or II ( MHC I or II ) was high , thus establishing an inverse relation ( MHC I , r = -0.791 ; P < 0.01 ; MHC II , r = -0.784 ; P < 0.01 ) .
In situ hybridization showed that apart from lymphocytes , thyroid cells themselves were the source of MHC II transcripts .
gamma-Interferon expression was only detectable in 1 Hashimoto 's goiter .
Our findings suggest that next to lymphocyte infiltration , active regulatory events in the thyrocyte are responsible for the inverse relation between functional parameters ( TSH-R , thyroid peroxidase , thyroglobulin , and c-fos ) and immunological markers ( MHC I and II ) .
A reporter gene under the control of a T-cell antigen receptor element was activated in Jurkat cells by antigen receptor triggering or by a combination of phorbol myristate acetate , which activates protein kinase C , and a calcium ionophore .
Both these signals were necessary for expression of the reporter gene .
When co-transfected with a construct capable of overexpressing the tyrosine kinase p59fyn , the reporter gene was activated by PMA alone .
Thus p59fyn could replace the calcium ionophore but not activation of protein kinase C .
The activation by p59fyn plus PMA was blocked by EGTA and by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A .
Transcription of the human beta-globin gene cluster depends upon upstream regulatory sequences , which are collectively termed the locus control region .
Recent studies have provided new insights into how the individual genes of the cluster are regulated through development .
The crux of transcriptional activation is how the locus control region communicates with the gene-proximal regulatory elements .
The GATA factors are a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins in eukaryotes that share extensive homology in their DNA-binding domains .
One enigmatic aspect of GATA factor expression is that several GATA proteins , which ostensibly share the same DNA-binding site specificity , are coexpressed in erythroid cells .
To elucidate the roles of individual GATA factors in erythropoiesis , conditional alleles of GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 were prepared by fusing each of the factors to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( ER ) .
These GATA/ER chimeric factors were shown to be hormone-inducible trans-activating proteins in transient transfection assays .
When stably introduced into primary erythroblasts or conditionally transformed erythroid progenitors cells , exogenous GATA-2/ER promoted proliferation and inhibited terminal differentiation in an estrogen-dependent manner .
These phenotypic effects are specifically attributable to the action of ectopically expressed GATA-2/ER because erythroblasts expressing exogenous GATA-2 are constitutively arrested in differentiation and because erythroid progenitors expressing either Gal/ER or GATA-3/ER do not display a hormone-responsive block in differentiation .
Thus , the GATA-2 transcription factor appears to play a role in regulating the self-renewal capacity of early erythroid progenitor cells .
Many effects of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on gene expression , including that of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , in monocytic cells are mediated by activation of kappa B DNA-binding proteins .
However , the specific members of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family involved in the LPS response , and the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are transduced remain unclear .
Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 heterodimers as well as p50/p65 ( NF-kappa B ) kappa B DNA-binding complexes in human monocytic THP-1 cells .
Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C .
Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of c-Rel , p105 , and p50 in the cytosol .
The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their mRNAs during LPS activation of THP-1 cells .
LPS activation of THP-1 cells resulted in phosphorylation of MAD3 ( an I kappa B-like protein ) , a rapid increase in MAD3 mRNA , and an increase in MAD3 protein by 2 h .
Thus , LPS activation of human monocytic cells results in nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 and p50/p65 ( NF-kappa B ) and induces phosphorylation of MAD3 .
The relationship between glucocorticoid effect and regulation of cell surface antigens was investigated in two models of leukemic cell lines , CEM C7 denoted ( r+ , ly+ ) and CEM C1 ( r+ , ly- ) .
The reactivity of murine monoclonal antibodies , anti-CD4-FITC , anti-CD8-FITC , anti-CD2-FITC and anti-calla-FITC , were analyzed using flow cytometry .
The suppressor function was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation into phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Dexamethasone treatment of a human leukemic cell clone CEM C7 caused an increase in a subset of cells expressing the surface antigen CD8 , which is present on suppressor and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes .
By comparison , there was no modification of the expression of CD4 antigen , which is expressed at high levels in these cells .
After two days of treatment with 5 x 10(-8) M dexamethasone , CEM C7 cells showed a two-fold increase in suppressor activity compared to untreated cells .
In contrast , there was no regulation by glucocorticoids of either the CD8 or CD4 antigens in the leukemic clone CEM C1 .
Furthermore , no modification of the suppressor function in CEM C1 cells by dexamethasone was observed .
In the human leukemic cells studied here , the ability to induce CD8 antigen expression in a CD4+ cells correlates with the ability to induce cell lysis in a glucocorticoid receptor positive cell population .
We have previously reported that the T lymphocytes of a child with severe combined immunodeficiency are defective in the transcription of several lymphokine genes that include IL2 , IL3 , IL4 , and IL5 , which encode interleukins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( IL-2 , -3 , -4 , and -5 ) .
To determine whether the defect in the patient 's T lymphocytes involved a trans-acting factor common to the affected lymphokine genes , we examined the ability of nuclear factors from the patient 's T lymphocytes to bind response elements present in the regulatory region of IL2 .
Nuclear factor NF-kB , activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) , OCT-1 , and NF-IL-2B binding activity were normal .
In contrast , the binding of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) to its response element in the IL2 enhancer and to an NF-AT-like response element present in the IL4 enhancer was abnormal .
To ascertain whether the abnormal NF-AT binding activity was related to an impaired function , we transfected patient and control T lymphocytes with constructs containing the reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) under the control of the entire IL2 regulatory region or of multimers of individual enhancer sequences .
CAT expression directed by the IL2 regulatory region or by a multimer of the NF-AT-binding site was markedly lower in the patient relative to controls .
In contrast , CAT gene expression directed by a multimer of the OCT-1 proximal ( OCT-1p ) -binding site was equivalent in patient and controls .
These results indicate that an abnormality of /or influencing NF-AT may underlie the multiple lymphokine deficiency in this patient .
The expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 was studied in eosinophils and basophils .
Eosinophils express mRNA for GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 .
Basophils express GATA-2 and GATA-3 .
Treatment of HL-60 eosinophilic sublines with either interleukin-5 or butyric acid increased the expression of GATA-1 mRNA concomitant with the expression of eosinophil-specific genes , whereas levels of GATA-2 mRNA remained relatively constant .
The presence of mRNA for these proteins in eosinophils and basophils suggests that gene transcription in these lineages may be regulated by GATA-binding proteins .
BACKGROUND .
The proliferative activity of tumors has been extensively investigated with different approaches , among which the use of the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 represents an easy and reliable means of assessing cell proliferation .
In this study , the proliferative activity of 129 primary breast cancers was investigated , and the results were related to prognosis .
METHODS .
Tumor samples , obtained from 129 patients who underwent surgery between January 1987 and December 1988 , were processed for staining by an immunohistochemical procedure ( avidin-biotin complex ) .
The median time of observation was 42 months ( range , 31-55 months ) .
Life-table analysis ( Mantel-Cox ) was used to assess the probability of disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
RESULTS .
Tumors with high Ki-67 proliferation indices ( > 20 % ) were associated with a higher 4-year probability of relapse of disease ( 55.3 % versus 79.1 % ; P = 0.003 ) and death ( 71 % versus 95.6 % ; P = 0.00005 ) when compared with tumors with low Ki-67 values .
In addition , this proliferative parameter maintained its prognostic significance when the patients were stratified according to lymph node involvement , menopausal status , and nuclear estrogen receptor content .
CONCLUSIONS .
Tumor proliferative activity as evaluated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 seems to be an effective indicator of prognosis in breast cancer for DFS and OS .
Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) hormone-binding activity was studied by a whole-cell method in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) from peripheral blood of 7 patients during the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis .
4 patients were receiving dopamine , which did not affect the GR count .
The patients ' plasma cortisol concentrations were normal or slightly elevated .
Despite a wide range , the mean GR count and affinity in MNC from septic patients did not differ from those in normal controls , suggesting that glucocorticoids could still be effective in the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis .
Human peripheral blood monocytes ( Mo ) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for IL-2 , whereas expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain is not constitutive but inducible with IL-2 .
Here we report that binding of human IL-2 to its binding site leads to transcriptional activation of the macrophage CSF ( M-CSF ) gene in Mo resulting in accumulation of M-CSF mRNA and subsequent release of bioactive M-CSF protein as demonstrated by ELISA and inhibition of IL-2 induced release of an activity-stimulating growth of monocyte-type colonies by a neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody .
Transcriptional activation of the M-CSF gene by IL-2 is preceded by enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its recognition sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the M-CSF gene .
Moreover , using a heterologous promoter ( herpes thymidine kinase ) construct containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence , it is shown that NF-kappa B binding by an IL-2-induced monocyte-derived nuclear protein confers reporter gene ( human growth hormone ) activity .
Taken together , our findings indicate that IL-2 induces gene expression of M-CSF in human blood-derived Mo and provide evidence for involvement of NF-kappa B in transcriptional regulation of this gene .
Expression of the protooncogene c-fos is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C , cAMP , and calcium .
Kinase C mediates its effects via phosphorylation of serum response factor ( SRF ) which interacts with the serum response element ( SRE ) ; cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of CREB ( cAMP regulatory element binding protein ) presumably by activation of a protein kinase A or calmodulin-regulated kinase .
We have examined the function of these elements in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells ( Ramos and Daudi ) as well as a T lymphocytic cell line ( Jurkat ) .
We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on c-fos induction .
However , kinase C activation ( PMA stimulation ) combined with either cAMP ( forskolin plus MIX ) or calcium stimulation ( ionophore ) leads to greatly enhanced c-fos induction .
By contrast , cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in c-fos induction .
Okadaic acid augments PMA- as well as calcium-mediated activation of c-fos , and has little or no effect when combined with cAMP .
The main difference between Ramos ( B cells ) and Jurkat ( T cells ) in the regulation of c-fos is that cAMP plus calcium is strongly synergistic in Jurkat and is without effect in Ramos .
Analysis of AP-1 activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in c-fos mRNA induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of AP-1 activity .
Signaling in B cells due to anti-Ig stimulation involves both kinase C activation and release of intracellular calcium , and results in c-fos mRNA induction .
Our results indicate that synergy between the kinase C activation and calcium is needed for efficient c-fos induction since neither of these two alone induces c-fos well .
That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the anti-Ig induction of c-fos is supported by the fact that cAMP-inducing agents and okadaic acid further enhance anti-Ig induction of c-fos .
These results suggest that cell-specific patterns of synergy are an essential feature for c-fos induction and may be relevant for c-fos control through B and T cell antigen receptors .
Activation of individual CD4+ T cells results in differential lymphokine expression : interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is preferentially produced by T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) cells , which are involved in cell-mediated immune responses , whereas IL-4 is synthesized by TH2 cells , which are essential for humoral immunity .
The Ca(2+)-dependent factor NF-ATp plays a key role in the inducible transcription of both these lymphokine genes .
However , while IL2 expression requires the contribution of Ca(2+)- and protein kinase C-dependent signals , we report that activation of human IL4 transcription through the Ca(2+)-dependent pathway is diminished by protein kinase C stimulation in Jurkat T cells .
This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of NF-ATp and NF-kappa B to the P sequence , an element located 69 bp upstream of the IL4 transcription initiation site .
Human IL4 promoter-mediated transcription is downregulated in Jurkat cells stimulated with the NF-kappa B-activating cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha and suppressed in RelA-overexpressing cells .
In contrast , protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does not affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence , which is a higher-affinity site for NF-ATp and a lower-affinity site for RelA .
Thus , competition between two general transcriptional activators , RelA and NF-ATp , mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on IL4 expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in TH cells .
B cell-specific transcriptional promoter activity mediated by the octamer motif requires the Oct1 or Oct2 protein and additional B cell-restricted cofactors .
One such cofactor , BOB.1/OBF.1 , was recently isolated from human B cells .
Here , we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of the murine homolog .
Full-length cDNAs and genomic clones were isolated , and the gene structure was determined .
Comparison of the deduced amino acids shows 88 % sequence identity between mouse and human BOB.1/OBF.1 .
The NH2-terminal 126 amino acids of BOB.1/OBF.1 are both essential and sufficient for interaction with the POU domains of either Oct1 or Oct2 .
This protein-protein interaction does not require the simultaneous binding of Oct proteins to DNA , and high resolution footprinting of the Oct-DNA interaction reveals that binding of BOB.1/OBF.1 to Oct1 or Oct2 does not alter the interaction with DNA .
BOB.1/OBF.1 can efficiently activate octamer-dependent promoters in fibroblasts ; however , it fails to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer activity .
Fusion of subdomains of BOB.1/OBF.1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain reveals that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of BOB.1/OBF.1 contribute to full transactivation function , the COOH-terminal domain is more efficient in this transactivation assay .
Consistent with the failure of full-length BOB.1/OBF.1 to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer elements in non B cells , the GAL4 fusions likewise only stimulate from a promoter-proximal position .
Two groups of HMG box proteins are distinguished .
Proteins in the first group contain multiple HMG boxes , are non-sequence-specific , and recognize structural features as found in cruciform DNA and cross-over DNA .
The abundant chromosomal protein HMG-1 belongs to this subgroup .
Proteins in the second group carry a single HMG box with affinity for the minor groove of the heptamer motif AACAAAG or variations thereof .
A solution structure for the non-sequence-specific C-terminal HMG box of HMG-1 has recently been proposed .
Now , we report the solution structure of the sequence-specific HMG-box of the SRY-related protein Sox-4 .
NMR analysis demonstrated the presence of three alpha-helices ( Val10-Gln22 , Glu30-Leu41 and Phe50-Tyr65 ) connected by loop regions ( Ser23-Ala49 and Leu42-Pro49 ) .
Helices I and II are positioned in an antiparallel mode and form one arm of the HMG box .
Helix III is less rigid , makes an average angle of about 90 degrees with helices I and II , and constitutes the other arm of the molecule .
As in HMG1B , the overall structure of the Sox-4 HMG box is L-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of conserved , mainly aromatic residues .
To identify osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors , we initiated an analysis of the promoter of a mouse osteocalcin gene , an osteoblast-specific gene .
In this promoter , we identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements ( Ducy , P. and Karsenty , G. ( 1995 ) Mol.Cell.Biol.15 , 1858-1869 ) .
The sequence of one of these elements , OSE2 , is identical to the DNA-binding site of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 transcription factors , the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Runt protein .
Here we show , using nuclear extracts , recombinant protein , and a specific antiserum against AML-1 proteins in DNA-binding assays , that one member of this family , AML-1B , binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to OSF2 , the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2 .
By DNA cotransfection experiments , we also demonstrate that AML-1B can increase the activity of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to OSE2 .
Lastly , the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract-DNA complexes compared with T-cell nuclear extract-DNA complexes , along with the inability of OSF2 to be upregulated by retinoic acid , unlike the other PEBP2 alpha factors , suggest that OSF2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors .
Thus , this study demonstrates that AML-1B can increase gene expression of an osteoblast-specific gene through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element and presents evidence that OSF2 is a member of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 family of transcription factors .
Thrombopoietin is known to be essential for megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis .
Recently , we and others have shown that thrombopoietin induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and other proteins in human platelets and BaF3 cells , genetically engineered to express c-Mpl , a receptor for thrombopoietin .
The Jak family of tyrosine kinases are known to mediate some of the effects of cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors by recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
Hence , we have investigated whether Stat proteins are present in platelets and , if so , whether they become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to thrombopoietin .
We immunologically identified Stat1 , Stat2 , Stat3 , and Stat5 in human platelet lysates .
Thrombopoietin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in these cells .
Thrombopoietin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in FDCP-2 cells genetically engineered to constitutively express human c-Mpl .
Thus , our data indicate that Stat3 and Stat5 may be involved in signal transduction after ligand binding to c-Mpl and that this event may have a role in megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis or possibly a mature platelet function such as aggregation .
The product of the B-cell-specific B29 gene ( B29 , Ig beta , CD79b ) is essential for Ig-mediated B-cell activation via the B-cell antigen receptor complex ( BCR ) on human and murine B lymphocytes .
To better understand the regulation of this pivotal gene , we have analyzed the human genomic DNA sequence upstream of the B29 ATG start codon for transcriptional control activity .
The human B29 gene lacks either a TATA or a CAAT box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites .
The minimal promoter of the human B29 gene is contained within a 193-bp region 5' of these multiple start sites .
This minimal promoter exhibits B-cell-specific activity and contains SP1 , ETS , OCT , and IKAROS/LYF-1 transcription factor motifs .
All these motifs are strikingly conserved in sequence and placement relative to the previously characterized murine B29 promoter .
Additional upstream gene segments dramatically affected B29 minimal promoter activity .
A newly identified motif called the B29 conserved sequence ( BCS ) , found upstream of both human and murine B29 promoters , appears to stimulate B29 transcription through a novel mechanism .
A single BCS had little effect either on the minimal B29 promoter or on a heterologous promoter .
Instead , the BCS stimulated transcription by counteracting 5' negative regulatory DNA sequences that block the activity of the B29 minimal promoter in its absence .
These findings indicate that B29 gene expression is controlled by the complex interplay of positive and negative regulatory elements .
Much attention has recently focused on the observation that UV light can activate the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
Although the mechanism of LTR activation remains obscure , several lines of investigation have suggested that it is a result of activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor ( s ) following signaling events related to generalized DNA damage .
In this report , we present data demonstrating that HIV LTR activation is not a general consequence of cellular DNA damage , but rather a process unique to specific genotoxic stimuli , and that it does not necessarily depend on activation of NF-kappa B .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that several of these agents can significantly increase HIV replication and accelerate CD4-positive lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro .
These findings , therefore , could have clinical significance to AIDS patients with malignancies who are undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
TCR engagement stimulates the activation of the protein kinase Raf-1 .
Active Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 ( MEK1 ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases , ERK1 and ERK2 .
Raf-1 activity promotes IL-2 production in activated T lymphocytes .
Therefore , we sought to determine whether MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL-2 gene transcription .
Expression of constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF-AT activity .
Expression of MEK1-interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf-1 to costimulate NF-AT activity with a calcium ionophore .
Expression of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase , MKP-1 , which blocks ERK activation , inhibited IL-2 promoter and NF-AT-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and in addition , MKP-1 neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression .
We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf-1 , MEK1 , and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes .
Elevation of the levels of circulating immune complexes frequently accompanies HIV-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS .
Here we report that cross-linking of Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII by adherent human IgG or by specific anti-Fc gamma R mAb activates HIV-1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line BF24 and increased HIV RNA expression in monocytes from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-PCR .
In THP-1 cells , Fc gamma R cross-linking induced NF-kappa B , which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription .
Anti-TNF-alpha antibody but not anti-IL-1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription and the induction of NF-kappa B by Fc gamma R cross-linking .
These results indicate that Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF-alpha-dependent induction of HIV-1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes .
Toremifene exerts multiple and varied effects on the gene expression of human peripheral mononuclear cells .
After short-term , in vitro exposure to therapeutical levels , distinct changes in P-glycoprotein , steroid receptors , p53 and Bcl-2 expression take place .
In view of the increasing use of antiestrogens in cancer therapy and prevention , there is obvious merit in long-term in vivo studies to be conducted .
Although their precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated , glucocorticoids represent the most effective therapy in the treatment of asthma .
Interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and the AP-1 complex have been shown to regulate the transcription of some genes , including glucocorticoid receptor itself .
The aim of the present study was to compare the expression of mRNA for glucocorticoid receptor in human blood monocytes obtained from seven unstable untreated asthmatic patients who were subsequently treated with high doses of parenteral corticosteroid ( methyl prednisolone 120 mg/day ) for 10 days .
mRNA expression was identified after RNA extraction using RNAzol and analysed after reverse transcriptase , by polymerase chain reaction using a semiquantitative competitive hybridization assay .
All asthmatic patients showed an improvement in their FEV1 values after corticosteroid treatment ( per cent of predicted value 68.28 +/- 4.93 versus 95.57 +/- 6.41 , P < 0.02 ) , and a significant decrease for glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression ( P < 0.02 ) was observed in their monocytes .
This is the first report of an ex vivo down-regulation for the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression , following corticosteroid treatment .
Activation through the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway is essential to the transcription of many cytokine genes .
The conserved cis-acting sequence , GGAAAA , and transcription factors binding to this sequence are involved in the response to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations .
Here we report the identification and importance of the same sequence in a non-cytokine gene , the human T cell receptor gamma ( TCRG ) enhancer .
Results from site-directed mutations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that this sequence mediates the ionomycin-induced activation of the TCRG enhancer .
Our studies provide an explanation for a previous observation that TCRG mRNA levels , but not mRNA levels for T cell receptor alpha and -beta , are increased by ionomycin treatment .
Campomelic dysplasia ( CMPD1 ) and autosomal XY sex reversal ( SRA1 ) are caused by mutations in the SRY-related gene SOX9 on 17q .
Unexpectedly , the 17q breakpoints in four CMPD1 translocation cases previously analyzed by us and others map 50 kb or more from SOX9 .
Here , we present clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular data from a new CMPD1/SRA1 patient with t(6;17)(q14;q24) .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization has shown that the 17q breakpoint in this case maps to the same region as the breakpoints in the other translocation cases , at least 130 kb from SOX9 .
Likewise , the breakpoints in two of the previously described cases also map more than 130 kb and , as shown by pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis , at most 400 kb or 690 kb from SOX9 .
By using a SOX9 coding sequence polymorphism , expression of both SOX9 alleles has been demonstrated by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in lymphoblastoid cells from one of the translocation cases .
Benzene toxicity towards lymphocytes is thought to be mediated by metabolites of benzene including benzoquinone ( BQ ) .
NAD(P)H:quinone reductase ( QR ) is known to protect against BQ toxicity .
The expression of the QR gene is regulated by the transcription factor AP-1 .
We had previously found that aspirin-like drugs ( ALD ) induce AP-1 in human T lymphocytes .
It was therefore hypothesized that ALD would protect lymphocytes against BQ toxicity by inducing QR .
Molt-4 cells ( M4 ) , a human T lymphocyte cell line , were incubated with different concentrations of two ALD , flurbiprofen and sodium diclofenac , and then exposed to BQ .
Toxicity was measured by viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) .
Both drugs protected the cells against BQ cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner , e.g. , sodium diclofenac at 15 microM reduced the fraction of BQ-treated dead cells by 70 % .
ALDs induced QR activity in the M4 cells in the same range of concentrations that protected the cells against BQ toxicity .
The protective effect of ALD was significantly reduced by dicoumarol , a QR-specific inhibitor .
Since human T cells and T cell lines do not metabolize arachidonic acid , our data suggest that ALD can protect human T lymphocytes against a metabolite of benzene by induction of QR activity .
Human herpesvirus 6 , a predominantly T lymphotropic virus , has been recently shown to infect some EBV -positive B cell lines , and to induce in them the activation of the EBV lytic cycle .
Here we have confirmed and extended such observations , showing that ( 1 ) this phenomenon is restricted to the variant A of HHV-6 : in fact two isolates belonging to the HHV-6 variant B ( BA92 and Z29 ) were neither able to infect any B cell line , independently of the EBV status , nor to induce the EBV genome expression .
The only exception is represented by the P3HR1 cells , in which , however , the infection by the variant B does not determine induction of EBV antigens ; ( 2 ) the presence of the EBV genome contributes to the susceptibility of the B cell lines to HHV-6 infection , increasing the binding sites and the percentage of infectable cells , as detected by immunoelectron microscopy ; and ( 3 ) HHV-6 infected T cells , transfected with plasmids bearing the promoter regions of the EBV early genes BZLF1 and BMRF1 , show a strong transactivation of these promoters .
A number of cytokines and growth factors use the JAK-STAT pathway to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus .
While homodimerizing cytokine receptors may transmit signal via a single form of JAK ( i.e. growth hormone receptors ) , several multicomponent cytokine receptors have been shown to require simultaneous activation of pairs of different JAK kinases ( i.e. interferon receptors ) .
Recent evidence for a preferential coupling of JAK3 to interleukin-2 receptor-gamma ( IL-2R gamma ) and JAK1 to IL-2R beta supports the concept of heterotrans-activation of JAK1 and JAK3 caused by IL-2-induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners .
The present study verified the ability of IL-2 to cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 and JAK3 , but demonstrated that IL-2 stimulated JAK3 to a significantly larger extent than JAK1 in human T lymphocytes and the YT cell line .
This conclusion was based upon several independent criteria , including more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 , more marked enzymatic activation of JAK3 as well as higher abundance of JAK3 in activated IL-2 receptor complexes .
Furthermore , when human IL-2R beta was stably expressed in murine BA/F3 cells , robust IL-2-induced proliferation and JAK3 activation occurred without detectable involvement of either JAK1 , JAK2 or TYK2 .
We therefore propose that IL-2 receptor signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of JAK1 and JAK3 following IL-2-induced heterodimerization of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma .
Nonetheless , a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2R beta ( Asn240-Leu335 ) was critical for JAK3 activation , and the amount of JAK3 present in activated IL-2 receptor complexes increased with time , suggesting that stabilization of JAK3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma .
Moreover , STAT5 was found to be the predominant STAT transcription factor used by IL-2 in human T cells , and specifically required a COOH-terminal region of IL-2R beta ( Ser386-Val525 ) , while STAT5 recruitment was not correlated to activation of IL-2R gamma or JAK3 .
Most New World primate ( NWP ) genera evolved to require high circulating levels of steroid hormones and vitamin D .
We hypothesized that an intracellular vitamin D binding protein ( IDBP ) , present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of NWP cells , or another protein ( s ) may cause or contribute to the steroid hormone-resistant state in NWP by disruption of the receptor dimerization process and/or by interference of receptor complex binding to the consensus response elements present in the enhancer regions of steroid-responsive genes .
We employed electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) to screen for the presence of proteins capable of binding to the vitamin D response element ( VDRE ) .
Nuclear and post-nuclear extracts were prepared from two B-lymphoblastoid cell lines known to be representative of the vitamin D-resistant and wild type phenotypes , respectively .
The extracts were compared for their ability to retard the migration of radiolabeled double stranded oligomers representative of the VDREs of the human osteocalcin and the mouse osteopontin gene promoters .
A specific , retarded band containing VDR-RXR was identified when wild type cell but not when vitamin D-resistant cell nuclear extract was used in the binding reaction with either probe .
In addition , vitamin D-resistant cell nuclear extract contained a protein ( s ) which was bound specifically to the VDRE and was capable of completely inhibiting VDR-RXR-VDRE complex formation ; these effects were not demonstrated with nuclear extract from the wild type cell line or with the post-nuclear extract of the vitamin D-resistant cell line .
We conclude that a VDRE-binding protein ( s ) , distinct from IDBP and present in nuclear extract of cells from a prototypical vitamin D-resistant NWP , is capable of inhibiting normal VDR-RXR heterodimer binding to the VDRE .
The B cell-associated surface molecule CD40 plays a key role in T cell-dependent B cell maturation , as individuals with defects in either CD40 or its ligand are impaired in immunoglobulin isotype class switching and germinal center formation .
CD40 signaling activates downstream effectors , including the tyrosine protein kinase , Lyn , the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI-3 kinase ) , and the transcription factor , NF-kappa B .
In this study , we demonstrate that stress-activated protein kinases ( SAPK ) are activated after CD40 cross-linking on various B cell lines or human tonsillar B cells .
The activation is rapid and transient and is mediated through a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway .
Furthermore , this signaling pathway appears not to rely on protein kinase C .
While CD40 ligation strongly activates the SAPKs ( up to 25-fold ) , it does not affect members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family ( MAPK ; ERK1 and ERK2 ) .
Consistent with these data , CD40 signals up-regulate c-jun but not c-fos mRNA and alter the transcription factor ATF2 but not the Raf-1 protein .
In summary , CD40 signaling preferentially induces SAPK but not MAPK .
Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle .
A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity .
Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( HD1 ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library .
As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription .
IL-12 is a novel heterodimeric cytokine important for the regulation and differentiation of lymphocytes and NK cells .
Like other cytokines , IL-12 mediates its biologic activity through high-affinity receptors expressed on responsive cells .
To date , a large number of receptors for IL-12 have been found only on PBMC following activation with PHA or IL-2 .
To gain further knowledge of the IL-12R complex and the IL-12 signal transduction pathway in cytotoxic T cells , we studied a number of human T cell lines that had been transformed to permanent growth with Herpesvirus saimiri , an oncogenic virus of nonhuman primates .
This paper reports the expression of IL-12R on a human gamma delta T cell line that responds to IL-12 with enhanced cytolytic activity and increased expression of cytolytic effector molecules granzyme B and perforin .
Using these T cells as a model of IL-12 signal transduction , we confirmed that these events involve members of the Janus kinase family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases JAK2 , TYK2 , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 .
We have recently reported that IL-13R may share a component with IL-4R .
Here we report that both IL-4 and IL-13 share signaling events in human colon carcinoma cell lines ( HT-29 and WiDr ) .
IL-13 caused rapid phosphorylation of the three out of four members of the known Janus family of kinases ( JAKs ) .
We show that JAK2 kinase is rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to IL-13 .
Within 1 min of activation , JAK2 was phosphorylated , and peaked in 10 min .
In addition , IL-13 phosphorylated insulin response substrate-1 , IL-4R p140 , JAK1 , and Tyk2 , but not JAK3 kinase .
IL-4 also stimulated all three kinases and substrates , but unlike in immune cells , IL-4 did not involve JAK3 activation for its signaling in colon cancer cell lines .
Furthermore , JAK2 associated with the IL-4R p140 before and after stimulation with IL-13 .
Both IL-13 and IL-4 induced phosphorylation of IL-4 STAT ( STAT6 ) but not STAT1 , STAT3 , or STAT5 .
125I-IL-13 did not bind to colon cancer cell lines , but unlabeled IL-13 competed for the binding of 125I-IL-4 .
Our data suggest that IL-13 utilizes IL-4R and its signaling pathway , and JAK2 may play an important role in the function of IL-4R and IL-13R in colon cancer cells .
Activation of macrophages by bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces transcription of genes that encode for proinflammatory regulators of the immune response .
Previous work has suggested that activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) is one LPS-induced event that mediates this response .
Consistent with this notion , we found that LPS stimulated AP-1-mediated transcription of a transfected reporter gene in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 .
As AP-1 activity is regulated in part by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , which phosphorylates and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of c-Jun , we examined whether LPS treatment of macrophages resulted in activation of this kinase .
LPS treatment of RAW 264.7 cells , murine bone marrow-derived macrophages , and the human monocyte cell line THP-1 resulted in rapid activation of the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK .
Treatment with wild-type and rough mutant forms of LPS and synthetic lipid A resulted in JNK activation , while pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A inhibited this response .
Binding of LPS-LPS binding protein ( LBP ) complexes to CD14 , a surface receptor that mediates many LPS responses , was found to be crucial , as pretreatment of THP-1 cells with the monoclonal antibody 60b , which blocks this binding , inhibited JNK activation .
These results suggest that LPS activation of JNK in monocyte/macrophage cells is a CD14- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent event that may mediate the early activation of AP-1 in regulating LPS-triggered gene induction .
The nuclear distribution of GATA transcription factors in murine haemopoietic cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence .
Specific bright foci of GATA-1 fluorescence were observed in erythroleukaemia cells and primary murine erythroblasts and megakaryocytes , in addition to diffuse nucleoplasmic localization .
These foci , which were preferentially found adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery , did not represent sites of active transcription or binding of GATA-1 to consensus sites in the beta-globin loci .
Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intensely labelled structures likely to represent the GATA-1 foci seen by immunofluorescence .
The GATA-1 nuclear bodies differed from previously described nuclear structures and there was no co-localization with nuclear antigens involved in RNA processing or other ubiquitous ( Spl , c-Jun and TBP ) or haemopoietic ( NF-E2 ) transcription factors .
Interestingly , GATA-2 and GATA-3 proteins also localized to the same nuclear bodies in cell lines co-expressing GATA-1 and -2 or GATA-1 and -3 gene products .
This pattern of distribution is , thus far , unique to the GATA transcription factors and suggests a protein-protein interaction with other components of the nuclear bodies via the GATA zinc finger domain .
Pax-5 encodes the transcription factor BSAP which plays an essential role in early B cell development and midbrain patterning .
In this study we have analysed the structural requirements for transcriptional activation by BSAP .
In vitro mutagenesis and transient transfection experiments indicate that the C-terminal serine/threonine/proline-rich region of BSAP contains a potent transactivation domain of 55 amino acids which is active from promoter and enhancer positions .
This transactivation domain was found to be inactivated by a naturally occurring frameshift mutation in one PAX-5 allele of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line REH .
The function of the transactivation domain is negatively regulated by adjacent sequences from the extreme C-terminus .
The activating and inhibitory domains function together as an independent regulatory module in different cell types as shown by fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain .
The same arrangement of positively and negatively acting sequences has been conserved in the mammalian Pax-2 and Pax-8 , the zebrafish Pax-b as well as the sea urchin Pax-258 proteins .
These data demonstrate that the transcriptional competence of a subfamily of Pax proteins is determined by a C-terminal regulatory module composed of activating and inhibitory sequences .
Recombinant c-Jun and c-Fos were ubiquitinylated by the ubiquitin carrier enzymes E214K , E220K , or E232K in the presence of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme , E1 .
Addition of ubiquitin protein ligase E3 substantially enhanced the E214K-mediated ubiquitinylation of c-Jun and c-Fos .
Truncated c-Jun and c-Fos mutant proteins including wbJun and wbFos were also ubiquitinylated under the same conditions , suggesting the sites of ubiquitinylation are located within the dimerization and DNA binding domains of c-Jun and c-Fos .
The E3-dependent ubiquitinylation of c-Jun was inhibited upon the heterodimerization of c-Jun with c-Fos .
Further addition of E220K significantly enhanced ubiquitinylation of c-Jun in the heterodimer suggesting a regulatory role of E220K .
Polyubiquitinylated c-Jun , wbFos , and wbJun , but not E220K-ubiquitinylated c-Jun , were readily degraded by the ATP-dependent 26 S multicatalytic proteases .
These results suggest that the temporal control of c-Jun and c-Fos may be regulated through the ubiquitinylation pathways , and the ubiquitinylation of c-Jun and c-Fos may in turn be regulated in response to the heterodimerization between them and the cooperation between E220K and E3 mediated polyubiquitinylation .
A proportion of HIV-infected individuals experience episodes of localized or systemic bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria .
Many of the clinical side effects of these infections are associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines , which are induced primarily by LPS , a constituent of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria .
The present study examines the mechanisms involved in LPS-mediated induction of HIV expression in U1 cells , a promonocytic cell line chronically infected with HIV .
Stimulation of U1 cells by LPS alone induced minimal levels of HIV expression , which was significantly enhanced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .
Costimulation of U1 cells with LPS plus GM-CSF resulted in the accumulation of steady-state levels of HIV RNA ; however , only a weak induction of HIV long terminal repeat-driven transcription , which was not associated with the activation of the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B , was noted .
Costimulation of cells with LPS plus GM-CSF induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines , IL-8 , IL-1 beta and IL-6 , but not TNF-alpha .
IL-1 receptor antagonist ( ra ) inhibited LPS enhancement of HIV expression in GM-CSF-stimulated cells , suggesting that endogenous IL-1 was involved in LPS-mediated viral production .
In this regard , anti-inflammatory cytokines inhibited LPS plus GM-CSF-stimulated HIV expression , and this effect closely correlated with inhibition of IL-1 beta release and , in particular , with up-regulation of endogenous IL-1ra production .
Thus , the balance between an endogenously produced viral inducer ( IL-1 beta ) and an inhibitor ( IL-1ra ) may represent an important pathway leading to modulation of HIV expression from monocytic cells .
Two Jurkat cell clones have been stably transfected with a reporter vector for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
Upon stimulation , they express high levels of secreted heat stable placental alkaline phosphatase .
With these clones , we demonstrated that NFAT activation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin was inhibited by both cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( IC50 = 8 nM ) and FK506 ( IC50 = 160 pM ) , presumably by inhibition of calcineurin activity .
Selective phosphatase inhibitors for protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) and 2A ( PP2A ) that do not inhibit calcineurin , such as okadaic acid and calyculin A , also inhibited NFAT activation with IC50s of 87 nM and 4 nM , respectively , suggesting that okadaic acid and related inhibitors may block NFAT activation through the inhibition of PP1 , instead of PP2A .
NFAT activation was also inhibited by agents that increase cAMP concentrations such as dibutyryl cAMP , forskolin and prostaglandin E2 .
These stable Jurkat cell clones provide a convenient and sensitive tool to study NFAT regulation .
Although transcriptional factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) are important for the normal induction of IL-2 , it is unknown if the age-related decline in IL-2 production by activated human T cells may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins .
In the current studies , IL-2 production by T cells from elderly ( mean 78 years ) and young ( mean 37 years ) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with PHA , PHA plus PMA , crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus PMA , or PMA plus ionomycin .
Substantial decreases of IL-2 production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli , whereas the levels of IL-2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects .
Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased IL-2 production by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both AP-1 and NF-AT .
By contrast , T cells from elderly subjects with normal levels of IL-2 production exhibited normal activation of AP-1 and NF-AT .
In addition , the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF-AT showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent NF-AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 .
The resting and stimulated levels of NF kappa B were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals ; however , alterations of NF kappa B did not correlate with changes in IL-2 expression .
Thus , these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of AP-1 and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL-2 and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 may contribute to the impaired activation of NF-AT .
The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator ( META ) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region .
Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes , being specific to T cells , dependent on their activation , and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) .
DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site , META(P) , and a promoter-distal site , META(D+) , within the 400-base pair META region .
Nuclear factors from unstimulated , but not from activated cells , bound a site , META(D-) , adjacent to META(D+) .
META(D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene , and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible , CsA-sensitive T cell factors , in parallel with transfection results .
Authentic NFAT and NF-kappaB targets did not compete for the META(D+) binding factor ( s ) .
The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors , but META(D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe .
Our results , taken together , indicate that META(D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity , activation dependence , and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element .
It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas .
The role of alterations of the MTS1 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9p21 , which encodes p16 , the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 and 6 , in tumorigenesis is not yet clear .
Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 prevents its interaction with the transcription factor E2F , which subsequently promotes the expression of S phase regulated genes , such as thymidine kinase .
Although a role of p16 in this regulation has been presumed , there is no proof so far that loss of this tumor suppressor gene really affects E2F-mediated regulations .
We investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in the p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines , MOLT-4 and CEM .
Compared to normal lymphocytes , MOLT-4 and CEM cells exhibited an altered cell cycle regulation of thymidine kinase , a much higher intracellular activity of this enzyme , and higher thymidine kinase mRNA expression .
Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1 , but was without effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells , although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein .
Nevertheless , in the two leukemia cell lines transient overexpression of p16 reestablished the normal regulation of thymidine kinase , paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein and decrease of free E2F bound to its motif in the thymidine kinase promoter .
We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein .
Stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and effector functions of T cells .
The ability of T cells to form high intracellular levels of cAMP is acquired during development in the human thymus and is retained by the majority of mature peripheral T lymphocytes .
Here we show that elevated cAMP levels in T cells correlate with the expression of the potent transcriptional repressor ICER ( inducible cAMP early repressor ) previously described in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis .
Further , in transcriptional assays in vivo , ICER inhibits calcineurin-mediated expression of the interleukin 2 promoter as well as Tax-mediated transactivation of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) promoter .
Thus , the induction of ICER in T cells may play an important role in the cAMP-induced quiescence and the persistent latency of HTLV-I .
Animal lectins play important roles in a variety of biological processes via their recognition of glycoconjugates .
Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding lectin previously designated as epsilon BP ( IgE-binding protein ) , CBP35 , Mac-2 , L-29 , and L-34 , and its expression has been associated with various physiological and pathological processes , including cell growth , tumor transformation , and metastasis .
Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many leukocytes , with the notable exception of B and T lymphocytes .
We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number of human T lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) -I-infected human T cell lines , including F6T , HUT 102 , K3T , MT-2 , and SLB-I , but is not expressed in non-HTLV-I-infected T cell lines such as Jurkat , CEM , and MOLT-4 .
In addition , the galectin-3 level was markedly increased in human thymocytes after infection with HTLV-I as compared with uninfected thymocytes .
The up-regulation of galectin-3 expression appeared to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression , as undetectable or very low levels of galectin-3 were found in the S1T and ATL-1K cell lines , which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I .
In co-transfection experiments , the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors encoding the 40-kd Tax protein , a potent transactivator in HTLV-I .
Analysis of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and , to a lesser extent , nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction .
Transfection of human promonocytic U-937 cells with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced galectin-3 expression in this cell line .
Functionally , galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells .
Together , these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of galectin-3 , which in turn may further activate these T cells and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-I .
To develop a transformation system with a conditional Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) gene , we fused the hormone binding domain of the oestrogen receptor to the N or C terminus of EBNA2 .
In promoter transactivation as well as primary B cell transformation assays these chimeric EBNA2 proteins are able to substitute for wild-type EBNA2 in the presence of oestrogen .
Here we provide evidence that this transformation is the result of double infection of a cell with two virions , the P3HR1 virus genome and a mini-EBV plasmid carrying the chimeric EBNA2 gene .
Unexpectedly , expression of the same EBNA2-oestrogen receptor fusion protein in established human B cell lymphoma lines resulted in growth retardation or growth arrest upon the addition of oestrogen .
By titrating the oestrogen concentration in these stably transfected cells , the growth retarding and the transactivating function of the chimeric proteins could not be dissociated .
We propose that growth inhibition of established B cell lymphoma lines is a novel function of EBNA2 which has not been detected in the absence of an inducible system .
It remains open whether the growth retarding property of the EBNA2-oestrogen receptor fusion protein in B cell lymphoma lines is due to unphysiologically high expression of the chimeric protein or to interference with a cellular programme driving proliferation in these cell lines .
Herpesvirus saimiri is a lymphotropic herpesvirus capable of immortalizing and transforming T cells both in vitro and in vivo .
Immortalized and transformed T cells harbor several copies of the viral genome as a persisting genome .
The mapping of the cis-acting genetic cis-acting segment ( oriP ) required for viral episomal maintenance is reported here .
Viral DNA fragments that potentially contain oriP were cloned into a plasmid that contains the hygromycin resistance gene .
After several round of subcloning followed by transfection , oriP was mapped to a 1.955-kb viral segment .
This viral fragment permits stable plasmid replication without deletion or rearrangement as well as episomal maintenance without integration or recombination .
The function of oriP depends on a trans-acting factor ( s ) encoded by the viral genome .
The 1.955-kb viral segment includes a dyad symmetry region located between two small nuclear RNA genes and is located upstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene homolog .
Therefore , this oriP contains novel elements distinct from those of other DNA viruses .
This work aimed to ascertain the role of kappaB-responsive elements of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer not only in early initiation but also in long-term maintenance of proviral transcription in cells of the monocytic lineage .
For this purpose , we used three main approaches .
The first was to abruptly terminate tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB binding to the enhancer sequences in U1 monocytic cells , using a short pulse of exogenous tumor necrosis factor .
This resulted in concomitant decrease in nuclear NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and endogenous long terminal repeat transcriptional activity .
The second was to suppress the permanent NF-kappaB translocation induced by HIV-1 replication itself in chronically infected U937 cells , using a specific proteasome inhibitor ( Z-LLL-H ) .
As early as 2 h after addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium , there was an inhibition of both constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and HIV-1 genome expression .
The third approach was to monitor the replication competence in U937 cells of an infectious HIV-1 provirus carrying point mutations in the kappaB-responsive elements of both long terminal repeats .
Compared with its wild-type counterpart , this mutated provirus showed a profoundly decreased , Z-LLL-H-insensitive transcriptional and replicative activity in U937 monocytes .
Together , our results indicate that occupancy of the viral enhancer by NF-kappaB ( p50/p65 ) heterodimers is required for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in monocytes , even in cells chronically infected and permanently producing functional HIV Tat protein .
Thus , the ability of HIV-1 replication to activate NF-kappaB is crucial to the intense self-perpetuated viral transcription observed in cells of the monocytic lineage .
Ten mutants of the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) SIVmac239 bearing deletions ( delta ) or substitutions ( subst ) in the NF-kappaB and/or Sp1 binding elements were created , and the replicative capacities of the mutants were analyzed .
All mutants , including one extensively mutagenized strain entirely missing the NF-kappaB and four Spl binding elements , replicated with wild-type kinetics and to a wild-type level in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures in 50 to 100 % of the experiments .
One group of mutants replicated very similarly to SIVmac239 in kinetics and yield in CEMxl74 cells ( 2 x NFKappaB > or = SlVmac239 approximately deltaNFkappaB approximately deltaSpl234 approximately substNFkappaB approximately substSpl2 approximately substSp23 ) , while a second group replicated with delayed or slightly delayed kinetics in CEMxl74 cells ( SIVmac239 > substSp34 > deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl234 approximately deltaNFkappaBdeltaSp1 > substSpl234 ) .
Reversions or additional mutations were not detected in the U3 and R regions of proviral DNA from CEMxl74 cells infected with the SIVmac239 mutants .
Similar results were obtained when mutants of SIVmacMER ( a macrophage-competent derivative of SIVmac239 ) were tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cell and CEMx174 cultures .
However , the growth of most mutated viruses was suppressed in primary rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages ( SIVmacMER approximately 2xNFkappaB approximately substNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaB > deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl234 approximately deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl > deltaSpl234 approximately substSpl2 > substSp23 approximately substSp34 approximately substSpl234 > or = SIVmac239 ) .
Thus , changes in the Sp1 binding sites had the most dramatic effects on SIVmac replication in primary macrophage cultures .
Analysis of long terminal repeat-driven secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in transient assays showed that , unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , the SIV long terminal repeat possesses an enhancer region just upstream of the NF-kappaB element which maintains significant levels of basal transcription in the absence of NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites .
This region is responsive to transactivation by Tat .
In addition , the SIV TATA box was shown to be stronger than that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .
Therefore , the surprisingly high replicative capacity of NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding site mutants of SIVmac is due to unique features or the enhancer/promoter region .
In resting T lymphocytes , the transcription factor NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions with members of the I kappa B family of inhibitors , including IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta .
During normal T-cell activation , IkappaBalpha is rapidly phosphorylated , ubiquitinated , and degraded by the 26S proteasome , thus permitting the release of functional NF-kappaB .
In contrast to its transient pattern of nuclear induction during an immune response , NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax transforming protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-1 ) .
Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
However , it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent rather than transient NF-kappaB response .
In this report , we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha , Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism .
Like IkappaBalpha , Tax-mediated breakdown of IkappaBbeta in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of IkappaBbeta at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region .
Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 Tax for IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta at the protein level , Tax selectively stimulates NF-kappaB-directed transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene .
Consequently , IkappaBbeta protein expression is chronically downregulated in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
These findings with IkappaBbeta provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in Tax-expressing cells .
To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE-1 ) , we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1 .
Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene .
Tax alone was also inactive .
However , expression of the reporter gene was induced by coexpression of Tax and CREB .
This effect was stronger with the GAD-CREB fusion protein .
Analysis of different CREB mutants with this genetic system indicated that the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues , which include the basic domain and the leucine zipper , are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by Tax .
To identify cellular proteins binding to TRE-1 in a Tax-dependent manner , this strain was also used to screen a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD .
Of five positive clones isolated from 0.75 x 10(6) yeast colonies , four were members of the CREB/activating transcription factor ( ATF ) family : CREB , two isoforms of the cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator ( CREM ) , and ATF-1 .
Interestingly , these three proteins can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus form a particular subgroup within the CREB/ATF family .
Expression of ATF-2 in S. cerevisiae did not activate TRE-1 in the presence of Tax .
This shows that in a eukaryotic nucleus , Tax specifically interacts with the basic domain-leucine zipper region of ATF-1 , CREB , and CREM .
The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit .
When fused to GAD , the C-terminal region of Ku was able to activate transcription via TRE-1 but this activation was not dependent on Tax .
Resting T cells express very low levels of c-Myb protein .
During T-cell activation , c-myb expression is induced and much of the increase in expression occurs at the transcriptional level .
We identified a region of the c-myb 5' flanking sequence that increased c-myb expression during T-cell activation .
In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR was performed to correlate in vivo protein binding with functional activity .
A protein footprint was visible over this region of the c-myb 5' flanking sequence in activated T cells but not in unactivated T cells .
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with nuclear extract from activated T cells and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new protein-DNA complex , referred to as CMAT for c-myb in activated T cells ; this complex was not present in unactivated T cells .
Because the binding site showed some sequence similarity with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) binding site , we compared the kinetics of induction of the two binding complexes and the molecular masses of the two proteins .
Studies of the kinetics of induction showed that the NFAT EMSA binding complex appeared earlier than the CMAT complex .
The NFAT protein migrated more slowly in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel than the CMAT protein did .
In addition , an antibody against NFAT did not cross-react with the CMAT protein .
The appearance of the CMAT binding complex was inhibited by both cyclosporin A and rapamycin .
The CMAT protein appears to be a novel inducible protein involved in the regulation of c-myb expression during T-cell activation .
The mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is the inactivation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin by the drug-immunophilin complex .
Inactive calcineurin is unable to activate the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a transcription factor required for expression of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene .
IL-2 production by CsA-treated cells is therefore dramatically reduced .
We demonstrate here , however , that NFAT can be activated , and significant levels of IL-2 can be produced by the CsA-resistant CD28-signaling pathway .
In transient transfection assays , both multicopy NFAT- and IL-2 promoter-beta-galactosidase reporter gene constructs could be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) /alpha-CD28 stimulation , and this activation was resistant to CsA .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed the induction of a CsA-resistant NFAT complex in the nuclear extracts of peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PMA plus alphaCD28 .
Peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PMA/alphaCD28 produced IL-2 in the presence of CsA .
Collectively , these data suggest that NFAT can be activated and IL-2 can be produced in a calcineurin independent manner .
CD36 is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain , which interacts with thrombospondin , collagens type I and IV , oxidized low density lipoprotein , fatty acids , anionic phospholipids , and erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum .
Its expression is restricted to a few cell types , including monocyte/macrophages .
In these cells , CD36 is involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells , and foam cell formation by uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein .
To study the molecular mechanisms that control the transcription of the CD36 gene in monocytic cells we have isolated and analyzed the CD36 promoter .
Transient expression experiments of 5'-deletion fragments of the CD36 promoter coupled to luciferase demonstrated that as few as 158 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct the monocyte-specific transcription of the reporter gene .
Within the above region , the fragment spanning nucleotides -158 to -90 was required for optimal transcription in monocytic cells .
Biochemical analysis of the region -158/-90 revealed a binding site for transcription factors of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor ( PEBP2/CBF ) family at position -103 .
Disruption of the PEBP2/CBF site markedly diminished the role of the PEBP2/CBF factors in the constitutive transcription of the CD36 gene .
The involvement of members of the PEBP2/CBF family in chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia , and in the transcriptional regulation of the myeloid-specific genes encoding for myeloperoxidase , elastase , and the colony-stimulating factor receptor , highlights the relevance of the regulation of the CD36 gene promoter in monocytic cells by members of the PEBP2/CBF family .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) mediates a wide variety of disease states including septic shock , acute and chronic inflammation , and cachexia .
Recently , a multivalent guanylhydrazone ( CNI-1493 ) developed as an inhibitor of macrophage activation was shown to suppress TNF production and protect against tissue inflammation and endotoxin lethality [ Bianchi , M. , Ulrich , P. , Bloom , O. , Meistrell , M. , Zimmerman , G.A. , Schmidtmayerova , H. , Bukrinsky , M. , Donnelley , T. , Bucala , R. , Sherry , B. , Manogue , K.R. , Tortolani , A.J. , Cerami , A. & Tracey , K.J. ( 1995 ) Mol.Med.1 , 254-266 , and Bianchi , M. , Bloom , O. , Raabe , T. , Cohen , P. S. , Chesney , J. , Sherry , B. , Schmidtmayerova , H. , Zhang , X. , Bukrinsky , M. , Ulrich , P. , Cerami , A. & Tracey , J. ( 1996 ) J.Exp.Med. , in press ] .
We have now elucidated the mechanism by which CNI-1493 inhibits macrophage TNF synthesis and show here that it acts through suppression of TNF translation efficiency .
CNI-1493 blocked neither the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced increases in the expression of TNF mRNA nor the translocation of nuclear factor NF-kappa B to the nucleus in macrophages activated by 15 min of LPS stimulation , indicating that CNI-1493 does not interfere with early NF-kappa B-mediated transcriptional regulation of TNF .
However , synthesis of the 26-kDa membrane form of TNF was effectively blocked by CNI-1493 .
Further evidence for the translational suppression of TNF is given by experiments using chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) constructs containing elements of the TNF gene that are involved in TNF translational regulation .
Both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the TNF gene were required to elicit maximal translational suppression by CNI-1493 .
Identification of the molecular target through which CNI- 1493 inhibits TNF translation should provide insight into the regulation of macrophage activation and mechanisms of inflammation .
A signal transduction pathway activated by many cytokines has recently been elaborated .
The JAK kinases and the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors have been found to be essential components .
In this report , we describe the presence of constitutively activated STAT factors in peripheral blood cells from patients with acute leukemia .
We used oligonucleotide probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters and the ISRE probe to detect STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells in bandshift assays .
Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters , but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe , when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) were investigated .
We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation .
Specific antibodies directed against the individual STAT proteins were used in supershift experiments .
STAT5- and STAT1-related factors were detected in ALL and STAT1- , STAT3- , and STAT5-related proteins were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML .
Since the cells were not treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted , we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo .
It is likely that the constitutive activation of STAT proteins is a part of the events of leukemogenesis .
Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid ( RA ) , similar to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , can act as a bifunctional regulator of the growth of bone marrow progenitors , in that it can stimulate granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) - or interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -induced GM colony formation , but potently inhibit G-CSF-induced growth .
The present study , using highly enriched human CD34+ as well as Lin- murine bone marrow progenitor cells , demonstrates a potent inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA on burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) colony formation regardless of the cytokine stimulating growth .
Specifically , 9-cis-RA potently inhibited the growth of BFU-E response to erythropoietin ( Epo ) ( 100 % ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) + Epo ( 92 % ) , IL-3 + Epo ( 97 % ) , IL-4 + Epo ( 88 % ) , and IL-9 + Epo ( 100 % ) .
Erythroid colony growth was also inhibited when CD34+ progenitors were seeded at one cell per well , suggesting a direct action of RA .
Using synthetic ligands to retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) that selectively bind and activate RAR-RXR or RXR-RXR dimers , respectively , we dissected the involvement of the two retinoid response pathways in the regulation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell growth .
Transactivation studies showed that both the RAR ( Ro 13-7410 ) and RXR ( Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 ) ligands were highly selective at 100 nmol/L .
At this concentration , Ro 13-7410 potently inhibited G-CSF-stimulated myeloid as well as SCF + Epo-induced erythroid colony growth .
At the same concentration , Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 had little or no effect on G-CSF-induced colony formation , whereas they inhibited 75 % and 53 % , respectively , of SCF + Epo-stimulated BFU-E colony growth .
Thus , the RAR-RXR response pathway can signal growth inhibition of normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells .
In addition , we demonstrate a unique involvement of the RXR-RXR pathway in mediating growth inhibition of erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cells .
The A-myb gene encodes a transcription factor that is related both functionally and structurally to the v-myb oncogene .
Following our observations that A-myb is expressed in a restricted subset of normal mature human B lymphocytes , with the phenotype CD38+ , CD39- , slgM- , we have now investigated the pattern of A-myb expression in neoplastic B cells representating the whole spectrum of B-cell differentiation and compared it to that of c-myb and B-myb .
In a panel of 32 B-cell lines , A-myb was very strongly expressed in most Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines , but weak or negative in 2 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , 4 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , 6 Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines , and 6 myeloma lines .
Protein expression paralleled that of the RNA .
We have also investigated A-myb expression in 49 fresh cases of B leukemias .
Among 24 ALL , 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and all these were negative for A-myb expression ; on the other hand , all 7 B-ALL cases ( slg+ ) , as well as one fresh BL case with bone marrow infiltration , expressed A-myb .
A-myb was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic leukemias ( PLL ) but was strongly expressed in 5/20 ( 25 % ) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) samples .
In the latter A-myb did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage .
Finally , we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into Richter 's syndrome and have found that the Richter 's cells expressed about 25-fold less A-myb RNA than the CLL cells from the same patient .
The pattern of c-myb and B-myb was clearly distinct from that of A-myb .
C-myb and B-myb were expressed in all neoplastic groups , except in CLL cells .
Thus , A-myb expression , unlike that of c-myb and B-myb , is restricted to a subset of B-cell neoplasias ( in particular BL and slg+B-ALL ) representative of a specific stage of B-cell differentiation .
This expression may in part reflect expression of A-myb by the normal germinal center B cells that are the normal counterpart of these transformed B cells .
The data presented strongly support a role for this transcription factor in B-cell differentiation and perhaps in B-cell transformation in some neoplasias .
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) , a rare form of mature T-cell leukemias , and ataxia telangiectasia clonal proliferation , a related condition occurring in patients suffering from ataxia telangiectasia , have been associated to translocations involving the 14q32.1 or Xq28 regions , where are located the TCL1 and MTCP1 putative oncogenes , respectively .
The MTCP1 gene is involved in the t(X;14)(q28;q11) translocation associated with these T-cell proliferations .
Alternative splicing generates type A and B transcripts that potentially encode two entirely distinct proteins ; type A transcripts code for a small mitochondrial protein , p8MTCP1 , and type B transcripts , containing an additional open reading frame , may code for 107 amino-acid protein , p13MTCP1 .
The recently cloned TCL1 gene , also involved in translocations and inversions associated with T-cell proliferations , codes for a 14-kD protein that displays significant homology with p13MTCP1 .
We have generated rabbit antisera against this putative p13MTCP1 protein and screened for expression of p13MTCP1 normal lymphoid tissues and 33 cases of immature and mature lymphoid T-cell proliferations using a sensitive Western blot assay .
We also investigated the MTCP1 locus configuration by Southern blot analysis .
The p13MTCP1 protein was detected in the three T-cell proliferations with MTCP1 rearrangements because of t(X;14) translocations , but neither in normal resting and activated lymphocytes nor in the other T-cell leukemias .
Our data support the hypothesis that p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 form a new protein family that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of T-PLL and related conditions .
In human Jurkat T cells and its subclone Wurzburg cells oxidant challenge elevated [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores .
In Jurkat cells this effect was rapid and transient , but in Wurzburg cells the response was slow and sustained .
H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA .
In Jurkat cells that are not sensitive to H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation , H2O2 potentiated NF-kappaB activation in the presence of sustained high [Ca2+]i following thapsigargin treatment .
NF-kappaB regulatory effect of alpha-lipoate and N-acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of [Ca2+]i following oxidant challenge .
Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i is a significant factor in oxidant-induced NF-kappaB activation .
The costimulatory molecule B7.1 provides a second signal critical for T cell activation .
The distribution of this integral membrane protein is restricted to certain tissues where its level of expression is modulated by multiple exogenous stimuli .
To identify the molecular basis for specificity and inducibility , the chromatin configuration of the human B7.1 gene was examined in intact nuclei from various cell types .
The identification of a tissue-specific deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive site approximately 3kb upstream of the transcription start site led to the characterization of a cell type-specific enhancer region .
This 183-bp region was both cell type specific and responsive to two distinct stimuli , lipopolysaccharide and dibutyryl cAMP , known to regulate B7.1 expression .
Deletional and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the presence of multiple functionally critical cis elements within this region , one of which was a nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB consensus sequence .
In B7.1-positive B cells , this element bound several members of the NF-kappaB family , transcription factors already implicated in signal transduction pathways relevant to B7.1 expression .
This is the first description , to our knowledge , of regulatory elements that control expression of a gene encoding a B7 costimulatory molecule .
A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection .
OM10.1 , a promyelocyte cell line latently infected with HIV-1 , has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression .
We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any cytokines .
The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using anti-TNF-alpha antibody and various inhibitors .
Although the TNF-alpha level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production .
Staurosporine ( PKC inhibitor ) , pentoxifylline ( NF-kappa B inhibitor ) , and Ro5-3335 ( HIV-1 Tat inhibitor ) also inhibited significantly the heat shock induced virus activation .
In particular , staurosporine achieved approximately 90 % inhibition of the HIV-1 antigen expression in heat shock-treated OM10.1 at a non-toxic concentration .
Although the mechanism of HIV-1 activation with heat shock has not been fully elucidated yet , it is presumed PKC plays an important role in HIV-1 activation .
Thus , the present observations will provide a further insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections .
Transcription factor NF-E2 is crucial for regulation of erythroid-specific gene expression .
p45 subunit of NF-E2 contains a basic-leucine zipper domain and dimerizes with the small Maf family protein to form functional NF-E2 complex .
While p45 expression was shown to be restricted to erythroid cells , megakaryocytes and mast cells in hematopoietic lineage , we found in this study that p45 mRNA is abundantly transcribed in the granulocyte fraction of human peripheral blood cells .
As neutrophils occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in granulocyte fraction of human peripheral blood cells .
As neutrophils occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in this fraction , the cells expressing p45 is most likely to be neutrophils .
p45 mRNA is also expressed in HL-60 promyelocytes , albeit the expression level is much lower than that of the granulocyte fraction .
HL-60 cells were found to express mafK mRNA , indicating the presence of genuine NF-E2 complex in the cells .
Although p45 mRNA is transcribed from two different promoters , aNF-E2 promoter and fNF-E2 promoter , in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage cells , p45 mRNA is transcribed only from aNF-E2 promoter .
The expression of p45 megakaryocytic lineage cells , p45 mRNA is transcribed only from aNF-E2 promoter .
The expression of p45 mRNA in the neutrophils declined rapidly after transfer of the cells to in vitro culture and G-CSF could not sustain the expression from the down-regulation , suggesting the E2 may also participate in the regulation of neutrophil-specific gene expression .
Domain E , considered as the putative hormone binding domain ( HBD ) of the human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with either maltose binding protein ( MBP ) or glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) .
These bacterially-produced MR constructs had no steroid binding activity per se .
In fact , heat shock protein association ( hsp ) is required for high affinity ligand-binding of the MR .
After incubation of purified MBP- or GST-HBD with rabbit reticulocyte lysate , known to be rich in heat shock proteins , we obtained saturable binding of [3H]aldosterone .
The Kd value for aldosterone was 0.3 nM and the Bmax = 32 pmol/mg .
Hormone binding specificity was assessed by competition studies with various steroid ligands .
Sucrose gradient assays performed with [3H]aldosterone-MBP-HBD revealed complex sedimenting at 8.3S and 4.9S with [3H]progesterone-MBP-HBD .
Western-blot analysis of the sedimentation peak showed the concomitant presence of MBP-HBD by a monoclonal anti-MBP antibody , and hsp90 by a monoclonal anti-hsp antibody .
Moreover , following incubation with the anti-rabbit hsp90 monoclonal antibody the sedimenting gradient showed a 10.4S sedimenting complex .
These analyses demonstrated that the [3H]aldosterone-MBP-HBD complex is at least associated with hsp90 in reticulocyte lysate and that the HBD of hMR is sufficient to bind hsp90 .
Deletions of a relatively short amino- ( 729-766 ) or carboxy- terminal ( 940-984 ) region of the HBD fragment eliminated all steroid-binding properties .
Overall , these results indicate that the integrity of domain E is necessary and sufficient to bind steroid ligands , agonists or antagonists , with characteristics similar to the entire native MR .
Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein , which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB .
The processing of p105 occurs constitutively in vivo but can be markedly enhanced by various cellular activation agents , although the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet clear .
In the present study , we demonstrate that signal-mediated induction of p105 processing in human T cells is associated with de novo synthesis of this precursor protein .
Transient transfection studies performed in COS7 cells revealed that the newly synthesized p105 protein appears to be more rapidly processed compared to its accumulated form that is already associated with the processed product p50 .
Interestingly , the processing rate of p105 is markedly inhibited in cells co-transfected with p50 or other NF-kappaB subunits , including RelA and c-Rel , that physically interact with p105 .
These findings suggest that the processing of p105 is subject to negative regulation by the various NF-kappaB subunits .
We further demonstrate that p105 undergoes degradation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells .
However , the inducible degradation of p105 is not coupled with the generation of p50 .
Together , these studies demonstrate that the processing and inducible degradation of p105 are differentially regulated .
We describe the isolation of human LH-2 , a putative transcription factor containing two cysteine-rich regions ( LIM domains ) and a homeobox ( Hox ) DNA-binding domain .
High levels of hLH-2 expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) tested , regardless of disease status .
hLH-2 was mapped to chromosome 9Q33-34.1 , in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR-ABL chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ' ) , the hallmark of CML ; hLH-2 was retained on the derivative 9 chromosome and is therefore centromeric of c-ABL .
The proximity of hLH-2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 raises the possibility of cis-activation by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation .
In addition to finding hLH-2 expression in all cases of CML , expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines , but not in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia .
The role of hLH-2 in the development or progression of leukaemia is not known .
However , hLH-2 may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease .
We have previously shown that a DNA-binding factor specific to adult hematopoietic cells ( polypryrimidine-binding factor , PYBF ) binds to a pyrimidine-rich region 1 kb upstream from the human delta-globin-encoding gene ( HBD ) .
The developmental stage-specificity of PYBF and the location of its binding site between the fetal and adult beta-globin ( HBB ) -like genes suggest that PBYF and its binding site may function in fetal-to-adult globin gene switching .
Here , we describe the effect of 383-bp ( delta383 ) and 99-bp ( delta99 ) sequences containing the PYBF-binding site on transcription from various globin and non-globin promoters , using a transient assay with the cat reporter gene in murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells , a cell line with abundant PYBF activity .
We show that both delta383 and delta99 specifically enhance expression of cat for plasmids containing a human adult globin ( HBB ) promoter , whereas expression of similar constructs using human fetal ( A gamma- ) globin ( HBG1 ) or simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoters is not enhanced .
The results suggest that PYBF and the pyrimidine-rich region upstream from HBD can specifically enhance HBB transcription in adult erythroid cells .
We have isolated a novel cDNA clone encoding interferon ( IFN ) consensus sequence-binding protein in adult T-cell leukemia cell line or activated T cells ( ICSAT ) ; this protein is the human homolog of the recently cloned Pip/LSIRF .
ICSAT is structurally most closely related to the previously cloned ICSBP , a member of the IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family of proteins that binds to interferon consensus sequences ( ICSs ) found in many promoters of the IFN-regulated genes .
Among T-cell lines investigated , ICSAT was abundantly expressed in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -infected T cells .
When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used , ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT .
When the binding of ICSAT to four different ICSs was tested , the relative differences in binding affinities for those ICSs were determined .
To study the functional role of ICSAT , we performed cotransfection experiments with the human embryonal carcinoma cell line N-Tera2 .
ICSAT was demonstrated to possess repressive function over the gene activation induced by IFN stimulation or by IRF-1 cotransfection .
Such repressive function is similar to that seen in IRF-2 or ICSBP .
However , we have found that ICSAT has a different repressive effect from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP in some IFN-responsive reporter constructs .
These results suggest that a novel mechanism of gene regulation by " differential repression " is used by multiple members of repressor proteins with different repressive effects on the IFN-responsive genes .
Previous studies have indicated that the expression of viral oncoproteins , cell transformation , or phorbol ester treatment of cells can inhibit alpha/beta interferon ( IFN-alpha/beta ) -induced gene expression .
The mechanisms by which these promoters of cell growth exert their inhibitory effects vary , but in most instances they involve a disruption of the IFN-alpha/beta-induced transcription complex ISGF3 such that the DNA-binding component of this complex ( the 48-kDa ISGF3gamma protein ) does not bind to the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) .
In this report , we demonstrated that phorbol ester treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes dramatically inhibits activation of IFN-alpha/B-stimulated early response genes but by a mechanism which does not involve abrogation of the ISRE binding of ISGF3gamma .
Phorbol ester treatment of monocytes inhibited IFN alpha-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factors Stat1alpha , Stat2 , and Stat3 and of the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 but had no effect on IFN-gamma activation of Stat1alpha .
IFNalpha-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and the alpha subunit of the IFN-alpha receptor were unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
Moreover , PMA caused the dephosphorylation of Tyk2 but not of Jak1 , which was activated by IFN .
Pretreatment of cells with vanadate prevented the effects of PMA with regard to PMA-induced Tyk2 dephosphorylation .
These observations suggest that PMA exerts its inhibitory effects by activation of a tyrosine phosphatase which selectively regulates Tyk2 but not Jak1 activity .
Tissue specific regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a fascinating new field in molecular immunology .
This review summarizes data on specific regulation of promoters and enhancers by nuclear trans-acting factors in lymphocytes .
The structural classes of transcription factors are described and basic methods for detection and analysis of transcription factors are detailed .
Furthermore , the most important trans-acting factors of T and B lymphocytes ( e.g. NF-kB , NF-AT and STAT families ) and their functional importance are described .
Several methods for specific down-regulation of transcription factors are shown that may be relevant to treatment of human disease .
The data are discussed with regard to their potential clinical relevance for gastroenterology .
Tissue-specific expression of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is mediated via cis-acting elements located within 315 base pairs of the transcription start .
This is achieved in part through the positive activities of the AP-1 and Elf-1 sites in the IL-3 promoter .
The contribution to T cell-specific expression by other promoter sites was assessed in a transient expression assay with IL-3 promoter constructs linked to a luciferase gene , focusing initially on the core binding factor ( CBF ) site , which is footprinted in vivo upon T cell activation .
Activity of the CBF site is shown to be critically dependent on the adjacent activator site Act-1 .
Together the Act-1 and CBF sites form a functional unit ( AC unit ) with dual activity .
The AC unit is demonstrated to enhance basal activity of promoters both in fibroblasts and T cells .
This activity is further inducible in activated T cells , but not in fibroblasts .
In addition to the already identified NIP repressor site , evidence is presented for a second repressor region that restricts promoter activity in fibroblasts .
Finally , a novel positive regulatory element has been mapped in the IL-3 promoter between nucleotide -180 and -210 that leads to increased expression in T cells .
Together these results demonstrate that T cell expression of IL-3 is not specified by the activity of a single tissue-specific element , but instead involves multiple interacting elements that provide both specific positive regulation in T cells and specific negative regulation in fibroblasts .
The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor for interleukin 10 ( IL-10R ) contains two box 3 sequence motifs that have been identified in the signal-transducing receptor subunits for IL-6-type cytokines and noted to be required for activating STAT3 and inducing transcription through IL-6-responsive elements .
To determine whether the IL-10R has signaling functions similar to IL-6R in cells normally expressing these receptors , leukocytes of the B- , T- , and NK-cell lineages were treated with either cytokine .
Both cytokines activated factors that bound to the sis-inducible element and included STAT1 and STAT3 .
The cell response to IL-10 characteristically differed from that to IL-2/IL-15 , IL-4 , and interferon gamma .
The signaling capabilities of the IL-10R for activating specific STAT proteins and inducing gene transcription were defined by reconstitution of receptor functions in transfected tissue culture cells .
COS-1 cells , co-expressing the human IL-10R and individual STAT proteins , confirmed a preference of the IL-10R for STAT3 and STAT1 .
Unlike many hematopoietin receptors , the IL-10R did not detectably activate STAT5 .
The IL-10R , together with reporter gene constructs containing different IL-6-responsive gene elements , reconstituted in hepatoma cells an induction of transcription by IL-10 that was comparable to that by IL-6 .
This regulation could not be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of STAT proteins .
The similar actions of IL-10R and IL-6R on the induction of endogenous IL-6-responsive genes were demonstrated in hepatoma cells stably expressing the IL-10R .
These receptor functions required the presence of the box 3 motifs , as shown by the analysis of the mouse IL-10R constructs containing progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains .
The data demonstrate that the IL-10R , unlike other members of the interferon receptor family , is highly effective in recruiting the signaling pathways of IL-6-type cytokine receptors .
The lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2a is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif .
Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini .
The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct B cell-specific coactivators .
Recently , we have identified a repression domain located within the N terminus of Oct-2a ( amino acids 2-99 ) .
When this domain was transferred to a potent activator , transcription was strongly inhibited .
In this study we present a deletion analysis of the N-terminal region of Oct-2a to determine the minimal repression domain .
We identified a stretch of 23 amino acids , rich in serine and threonine residues , which was responsible for most of the repression activity .
We show that repression is strongly dependent on the type of enhancer present in the reporter plasmid as well as on the cell line tested .
The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes .
The transcription and transformation activity of c-Jun is governed by a 27-amino acid regulatory motif , labeled the delta-domain , which is deleted in v-Jun .
We have previously shown that c-Jun is a potent inhibitor of the rat prolactin ( rPRL ) promoter activity induced by either oncogenic Ras or phorbol esters .
Here , we have characterized the structural and cell-specific requirements for this c-Jun inhibitory response , and we show that this c-Jun inhibitory response mapped to the rPRL footprint II repressor site , was pituitary-specific and required the c-Jun delta-domain .
Moreover , alteration of any one of these features ( e.g. , cis-element , trans-factor , or cell-specific background ) switched c-Jun to a transcriptional activator of the rPRL promoter .
In HeLa nonpituitary cells , c-Jun alone activated the rPRL promoter via the most proximal GHF-1/Pit-1 binding site , footprint I , and synergized with GHF-1 .
Finally , recombinant GHF-1 interacted directly with c-Jun but not c-Fos proteins .
These data provide important fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the c-Jun delta-domain functions as a modulatory switch and further imply that the functional role of c-Jun is dictated by cell-specific influences and the delta-domain motif .
IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation .
Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag .
In this work , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma , as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor , STAT1(alpha) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription .
This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta- chain ( accessory factor ) of the IFN-gamma receptor , while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression .
Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment .
T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma .
When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness ; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain .
Therefore , as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2-dependent proliferation , followed by secondary TCR stimulation , their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies , and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response .
In this study , the IFN-gamma induction of MHC class II gene expression in primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) was analyzed .
This cellular system offers the advantage that MHC class II induction is studied in a " physiologic " cell lineage that , as a result of this expression within the thymus , is thought to participate to the selection and maturation of the T cells .
It was found that the MHC class II gene expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the CIITA trans-activator , a crucial MHC class II gene regulatory factor .
Furthermore , the anatomy of interaction between the MHC class II DRA promoter and corresponding binding factors was analyzed by in vivo DNAse I footprint .
It was found that treatment with IFN-gamma induces changes in the occupancy of the DRA gene regulatory sequences by nuclear factors .
The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the MHC class II-constitutive B cells , represented by both the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji and normal tonsil- derived B cells .
However , some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC , either IFN-gamma-induced or not , and the constitutive B cells .
These results suggest that both common mechanisms , such as the one mediated by the CIITA trans-activator , and distinct tissue-specific constraints contribute to the transcriptional control of constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II gene expression .
Spi-B is an Ets transcription factor related to the oncoprotein Spi-1/PU.1 and highly expressed in B lymphoid cells .
The Ets proteins share a conserved Ets domain that mediates specific DNA binding .
Spi-B binds DNA sequences containing a core 5'-GGAA-3' and activates transcription through this motif .
Up to date , the biological function of Spi-B remains unknown .
Here , we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of Spi-B , named deltaSpi-B , which has lost the Ets domain .
In B lymphoid cells , deltaspi-B and spi-B mRNAs were present simultaneously in a ratio of around 10 % .
DeltaSpi-B product was not able to bind DNA and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts .
We raise the hypothesis that delta Spi-B might affect Spi-B function by recruiting factors involved in Spi-B activity .
The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) and B cell octamer-binding protein 1/octamer-binding factor 1/Oct coactivator from B cells ( Bob1/OBF-1/OCA-B ) represent two B cell-specific transcriptional coactivators .
CIITA and Bob1 interact with proteins that bind to conserved upstream sequences in promoters of class II major histocompatibility genes and octamer-binding transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 , respectively .
Both CIITA and Bob1 increase the expression from the DRA promoter , which is a prototypic class II promoter .
Moreover , in the presence of CIITA , interactions between class II promoters and Bob1 are independent of the octamer-binding site .
Using in vivo and in vitro binding assays , we confirm that Bob1 binds to CIITA .
Thus , CIITA not only activates the expression of class II genes but recruits another B cell-specific coactivator to increase transcriptional activity of class II promoters in B cells .
B-cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is dependent on permanent control of the cellular processes which normally regulate cell division and apoptosis , functions possessed by p53 in a number of normal cell types .
In studies initiated to evaluate relationships between EBV latent genes and p53 , p53 levels were found to increase approximately 10-fold 4 to 5 days after EBV infection of purified resting human B cells ; the induced p53 was transcriptionally active .
Latent membrane protein 1 and , to a lesser extent , EBV nuclear antigen 2 mediated the increase in p53 levels via activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .
IL-2- , IL-12- , and IFN-alpha-mediated signaling pathways were analyzed in primary NK cells and in the NK3.3 cell line .
Gel mobility shift and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that in addition to activating STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 ) and STAT5 , IL-2 induced tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 alpha , which formed IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes by itself and with STAT3 .
Although IL-2 and IFN-alpha activated STAT1 alpha and STAT5 , IL-2 predominantly activated STAT5 , while IFN-alpha predominantly activated STAT1 alpha .
IL-2 induced less STAT1 alpha activation and IFN-alpha induced greater STAT5 activation in NK3.3 cells compared with preactivated primary NK cells .
In NK3.3 cells , IL-2 induced comparable formation of c-fos promoter sis-inducible element IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes containing STAT3 alone with complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha , while in preactivated primary NK cells , it preferentially induced complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha .
Thus , signaling in NK3.3 cells is not always identical with that in primary NK cells .
In contrast to IL-2 and IFN-alpha , IL-12 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 and variable weak phosphorylation of STAT3 .
However , supershift analyses using the c-fos promoter sis-inducible element probe showed that IL-12 activated STAT4 , STAT1 alpha , and STAT3 , and induced complexes containing STAT4 only , STAT4 with STAT1 alpha , STAT3 with STAT1 alpha , or STAT1 alpha only in preactivated primary NK cells .
STAT1 alpha activation by IL-12 correlated with increased phosphorylation of serine , but not tyrosine .
Finally , IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 , while IL-12 induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 in both preactivated primary NK and NK3.3 cells .
Differential phosphorylation and consequent differential activation of both separate and overlapping STAT proteins by IL-2 , IL-12 , and IFN-alpha may provide a molecular basis for the similarities and differences in the actions of these cytokines on NK cells .
IL-10 markedly reduces nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B/Rel nuclear activity induced in PBMC by stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 .
The inhibition is exerted specifically on the NF-kappa B/Rel activation induced by mAb OKT3 , and not that produced by PMA .
As judged by supershifting the DNA-protein complexes with Abs recognizing specific components of the NF-kappa B/Rel protein family , the p50/p65 ( Rel A ) heterodimeric form of NF-kappa B is primarily affected .
The maximal effect is observed at the IL-10 concentration of 20 U/ml .
IL-10 inhibitory activity is exerted on T lymphocytes and is mediated by monocytes .
Indeed , monocytes pretreated with IL-10 are able so inhibit NF-kappa B nuclear activity in purified T lymphocytes stimulated with OKT3 .
Soluble factors do not appear to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition .
On the other hand , the up-regulation of CD80 Ag , found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3 , is not detected after addition of IL-10 , and the anti-CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes .
Therefore , the NF-kappa B/Rel inhibition might be ascribed to a lack of cooperation between accessory cells and T lymphocytes , resulting from down-regulation of a costimulatory molecule , such as CD80 , produced by IL-10 on activated monocytes .
Our results demonstrate that IL-10 can inhibit the induction of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes .
Since inappropriate activation of kappa B-driven genes has a physiopathologic role in a number of diseases , such as HIV infection , our findings support the possibility of using this cytokine to suppress an undesirable activation of these transcription factors .
The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement .
Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21ras oncoprotein .
CaMKIV/ Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin .
AP-1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells .
We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells .
These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca(2+)-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .
The molecular background of the defects in the immune reactivity of human neonates has not been fully elucidated .
As the NF-kappa B transcription factor has a central role in the control of transcription of several genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , the authors have analysed the activation of NF-kappa B in human umbilical cord T lymphocytes .
The activity was tested by quantitating the nuclear proteins binding to an oligonucleotide containing the consensus kappa B binding sequence ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) .
The data obtained demonstrate that phorbol dibutyrate/calcium ionophore A23187 ( PDBu/iono ) combination induced a clearly higher nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in neonatal than adult T cells .
This higher NF-kappa B activity was restricted to the CD4+ T-cell subset .
Analysis of the nuclear extracts with antibodies directed against the major components of NF-kappa B the p50 and RelA ( p65 ) proteins , indicated that the composition of NF-kappa B was similar in neonatal and adult cells .
These results suggest that neonatal T cells are exposed to oxidative stress-inducing signals during delivery and/or are inherently more sensitive to NF-kappa B activating signals than adult T cells .
Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) -Grb2 fusion proteins have been used to identify the potential role of Grb2-binding proteins in platelet activation by the platelet low-affinity IgG receptor , Fc gamma RIIA .
Two tyrosine phosphoproteins of 38 and 63 kD bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 following Fc gamma RIIA stimulation of platelets .
Both are located in the particulate fraction following platelet activation and are also able to bind to a GST-construct containing the SH2 and SH3 domains of phospholipase C gamma 1 .
p38 also forms a complex with the tyrosine kinase csk in stimulated cells and is a substrate for the kinase .
The SH3 domains of Grb2 form a stable complex with SOS1 and two proteins of 75 kD and 120 kD , which undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in Fc gamma RIIA stimulated cells .
The 75-kD protein is recognized by antibodies to SLP-76 , which has recently been isolated from T cells and sequenced .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 and p63 is also observed in platelets stimulated by the tyrosine kinase-linked receptor agonist collagen and by the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin , although phosphorylation of SLP-76 is only observed in collagen-stimulated platelets .
p38 and p63 may provide a docking site for Grb2 , thereby linking Grb2 SH3-binding proteins SOS1 , SLP-76 , and p120 to downstream signalling events .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) and STAT transcription factor ( STAT5 ) pathway .
Recent studies have identified homologues of STAT5 , STAT5A , and STAT5B , as well as lower molecular weight variants of STAT5 .
To define the activation of the STAT5 homologues and lower molecular weight variant in human monocytes and monocytes differentiated into macrophages by culture in macrophage-CSF ( M-CSF ) , we measured the GM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A , STAT5B , and any lower molecular weight STAT5 isoforms .
Freshly isolated monocytes expressed 94-kD STAT5A , 92-kD STAT5B , and an 80-kD STAT5A molecule .
Whereas 94-kD STAT5A was clearly tyrosine phosphorylated and bound to the enhancer element , the gamma response region ( GRR ) , of the Fc gamma RI gene , substantially less tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5B bound to the immobilized GRR element .
Macrophages lost their ability to express the 80-kD STAT5A protein , but retained their ability to activate STAT5A .
STAT5A-STAT5A homodimers and STAT5A-STAT5B heterodimers formed in response to GM-CSF .
Therefore , activation of STAT5A predominates compared to STAT5B when assayed by direct immunoprecipitation and by evaluation of bound STATs to immobilized GRR .
Selective activation of STAT5 homologues in addition to generation of lower molecular isoforms may provide specificity and control to genes expressed in response to cytokines such as GM-CSF .
The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of many genes in activated human monocytes and endothelial cells .
In this study , we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) , tissue factor , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes .
Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP , which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms , inhibited TNFalpha and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription .
Induction of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , decrease nuclear translocation of p65 , or significantly modify TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p65 .
Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized kappaB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA .
This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated transcription .
Tepoxalin is a new dual cyclooxygenase/5-lipoxygenase anti-inflammatory compound currently under clinical investigation .
It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit IL-2 induced signal transduction .
The current study was conducted to evaluate the cytokine modulating activity of tepoxalin and the role of iron in these effects .
In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated with OKT3/PMA , tepoxalin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation with an IC50 of 6 microM .
Additionally , it inhibited the production of LTB4 ( IC50 = 0.5 microM ) and the cytokines IL-2 , IL-6 and TNF alpha ( IC50 = 10-12 microM ) .
Cytotoxicity was not demonstrated at these concentrations .
Add-back experiments with either cytokines ( IL-2 or IL-6 ) , LTB4 or conditioned media failed to restore the proliferative response in the presence of tepoxalin .
However , the concurrent addition of iron ( in the form of ferrous or ferric chloride and other iron salts ) reversed the inhibition of proliferation caused by tepoxalin .
Tepoxalin also inhibits the activation of NF kappa B , a transcription factor which acts on several cytokine genes .
Tepoxalin 's effect on NF kappa B is also reversed by the addition of iron salts .
These data suggest that the action of tepoxalin to inhibit proliferation in PBMC may be at least in part due to its ability to reduce the amount of available iron resulting in decreased activation of NF kappa B and subsequent inhibition of cytokine production .
During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of B lymphocytes in vitro , six viral nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) are expressed from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , whose activities are mutually exclusive .
Upon infection , Wp is initially active , followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency .
In this study , the region upstream of Cp was analyzed for the presence of cis elements involved in regulating the activities of the EBNA gene promoters in established in vitro immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .
It was determined that oriP , the origin for episomal maintenance during latency , is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs , as well as in some Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines .
Deletion of the EBNA2-dependent enhancer located upstream of Cp resulted in a ca. two- to fivefold reduction in Cp activity in the LCLs assayed .
More extensive deletion of sequences upstream of Cp , including the EBNA2-dependent enhancer , resulted in nearly complete loss of Cp activity .
This loss of activity was shown to correlate with deletion of two CCAAT boxes , a proximal CCAAT box located at bp -61 to -65 and a distal CCAAT box located at bp -253 to -257 , upstream of Cp .
Site-directed mutagenesis of these cis elements demonstrated that Cp activity is highly dependent on the presence of a properly positioned CCAAT box , with the dependence on the distal CCAAT box apparent only when the proximal CCAAT box was deleted or mutated .
Deletion of the glucocorticoid response elements located at ca. bp -850 upstream of Cp did not result in a significant loss in activity .
In general , deletions which diminished Cp activity resulted in induction of Wp activity , consistent with suppression of Wp activity by transcriptional interference from Cp .
The identification of oriP and the EBNA2-dependent enhancer as the major positive cis elements involved in regulating Cp activity in LCL suggests that EBNA gene transcription is largely autoregulated by EBNA 1 and EBNA 2 .
The transcriptionally regulatory regions of the lymphomagenic Akv and SL3-3 murine leukemia retroviruses ( MLVs ) contain two types of E-box consensus motifs , CAGATG .
One type , EA/S , is located in the upstream promoter region , and the other , E(gre) , is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties .
We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation .
In lymphoid cell lines only , the E(gre)-binding protein complexes included ALF1 or HEB and E2A basic helix-loop-helix proteins .
Ectopic ALF1 and E2A proteins required intact E(gre) motifs for mediating transcriptional activation .
ALF1 transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two E(gre) motifs equally , whereas E2A protein required the promoter-proximal E(gre) motif .
In T- and B-cell lines , the E(gre) motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity , while the EA/S motif had some effect .
In contrast , neither E(gre) nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins .
The Id1 protein was found to repress ALF1 activity in vitro and in vivo .
Moreover , ectopic Id1 repressed E(gre)-directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines .
In conclusion , E(gre) motifs and interacting basic helix-loop-helix proteins are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytic cell lines .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , like IL-4 , is known to inhibit cytokine expression in activated human monocytes .
We showed that both IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting the transcription rate of the IL-6 gene .
The strong inhibition of the IL-6 transcription rate prompted us to study the effect of IL-10 and IL-4 on the expression of transcription factors .
We questioned whether or not IL-10 and IL-4 affected the expression of transcription factors that are known to be involved in the control of the IL-6 transcription rate , namely activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor IL-6 ( NF-IL6 ) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) we showed that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced AP-1 binding activity .
The inhibiting effect of IL-4 was slightly more pronounced than that of IL-10 .
Downregulation of LPS-induced AP-1 was accompanied , and thus possibly explained , by a reduced expression at mRNA level of the two major components of the AP-1 complex , namely c-fos and c-jun as determined by Northern experiments .
Binding activity of NF-IL6 was also strongly inhibited by IL-4 whereas IL-10 showed no effect .
NF-IL6 mRNA levels were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4 , suggesting that IL-4 affects binding activity of preexisting NF-IL6 .
Neither IL-10 nor IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B binding activity .
In agreement with this finding , Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined , demonstrated that expression of these components of the NF-kappa B transcription factor were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4 .
Furthermore , neither IL-10 nor IL-4 showed any effect on I-kappa B mRNA expression as determined by Northern experiments .
Thus , IL-10 and IL-4 similarly affect IL-6 expression .
However , for IL-4 this was accompanied with a reduction of AP-1 and NF-IL6 binding activity whereas IL-10 only inhibited AP-1 binding activity .
The expression of distinct sets of genes at different stages of B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription .
A number of recent studies have described interactions between transcription factors in lymphocytes that provide new insights into mechanisms regulating gene expression .
These mechanisms include the assembly of higher order nucleoprotein complexes and other protein-protein interactions that enhance the functional specificity of transcriptional regulators in lymphocytes .
X inactivation analysis was performed on normal and hypopigmented skin samples obtained from a female with hypomelanosis of Ito associated with a balanced whole arm X ; 17 translocation .
Severe skewing of X inactivation resulting in inactivity of the intact X was found in blood and cultures of both types of skin , but analysis of DNA prepared directly from hypopigmented skin showed significant inactivation of the translocated X , inconsistent with the usual mechanism of phenotypic expression in X ; autosome translocations .
In addition , dual colour FISH analysis using centromere specific probes for chromosomes X and 17 showed that the breakpoints on both chromosomes lie within the alphoid arrays , making interruption of a locus on either chromosome unlikely .
While partial variable monosomy of loci on chromosome 17p can not be excluded as contributing to the phenotype in this patient , it is argued that the major likely factor is partial functional disomy of sequences on Xp in cell lineages that have failed to inactivate the intact X chromosome .
There is increasing evidence that lipoproteins of Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi are key inflammatory mediators during syphilis and Lyme disease .
A principal objective of the present study was to identify more precisely similarities and divergences among lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - and lipoprotein-lipopeptide-induced immune cell signaling events .
Like LPS , purified native B. burgdorferi OspA and synthetic analogs of OspA , OspB , and two T. pallidum lipoproteins ( Tpp47 and Tpp17 ) all induced NF-kappa B translocation in THP-1 human monocytoid cells .
Acylation of OspA and the synthetic peptides was requisite for cell activation .
Polymyxin B abrogated only the response to LPS .
By using 70Z/3-derived pre-B-cell lines either lacking or expressing human CD14 ( the LPS receptor ) , it was observed that expression of human CD14 imparted responsiveness to LPS but not to OspA or spirochetal lipopeptides ( assessed by induction of NF-kappa B and expression of surface immunoglobulin M ) .
Finally , the biological relevance of the observation that T. pallidum lipoproteins-lipopeptides induce both NF-kappa B and cytokine production in monocytes was supported by the ability of the synthetic analogs to promote human immunodeficiency virus replication in chronically infected U1 monocytoid cells ; these observations also suggest a potential mechanism whereby a syphilitic chancre can serve as a cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus transmission .
The combined data lend additional support to the proposal that spirochetal lipoproteins and LPS initiate monocyte activation via different cell surface events but that the signaling pathways ultimately converge to produce qualitatively similar cellular responses .
The lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene intronic enhancer is regulated by multiple nuclear factors .
The previously defined minimal enhancer containing the muA , muE3 , and muB sites is transactivated by a combination of the ETS-domain proteins PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells .
The core GGAAs of the muA and muB sites are separated by 30 nucleotides , suggesting that ETS proteins bind to these sites from these same side of the DNA helix .
We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these elements by using mutated enhancers with altered spacings .
A 4- or 10-bp insertion between muE3 and muB inactivated the mu enhancer in S194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1 , PU.1 , or the muE3-binding protein TFE3 , alone or in pairwise combinations .
Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets-1 bends mu enhancer DNA toward the major groove .
We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the muA and muB elements is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by PU.1 .
Vaccination with synthetic peptides representing cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitopes can lead to a protective CTL-mediated immunity against tumors or viruses .
We now report that vaccination with a CTL epitope derived from the human adenovirus type 5 E1A-region ( Ad5E1A234-243 ) , which can serve as a target for tumor-eradicating CTL , enhances rather than inhibits the growth of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors .
This adverse effect of peptide vaccination was rapidly evoked , required low doses of peptide ( 10 micrograms ) , and was achieved by a mode of peptide delivery that induces protective T-cell-mediated immunity in other models .
Ad5E1A-specific CTL activity could no longer be isolated from mice after injection of Ad5E1A-peptide , indicating that tolerization of Ad5E1A-specific CTL activity causes the enhanced tumor outgrowth .
In contrast to peptide vaccination , immunization with adenovirus , expressing Ad5E1A , induced Ad5E1A-specific immunity and prevented the outgrowth of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors .
These results show that immunization with synthetic peptides can lead to the elimination of anti-tumor CTL responses .
These findings are important for the design of safe peptide-based vaccines against tumors , allogeneic organ transplants , and T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases .
The Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is a 40-kDa transcriptional activator which is critical for HTLV-1 gene regulation and virus-induced cellular transformation .
Tax is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the site-specific activators cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein , NF-kappaB , and serum response factor .
It has been suggested that the recruitment of Tax to the DNA positions Tax for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery .
On the basis of several independent assays , we now report a physical and functional interaction between Tax and the transcription factor , TFIIA .
First , Tax was found to interact with the 35-kDa ( alpha ) subunit of TFIIA in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system .
Importantly , two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax , M32 ( Y196A , K197S ) and M41 ( H287A , P288S ) , which were shown to be defective in Tax-activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay .
Second , a glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) affinity-binding assay showed that the interaction of holo-TFIIA with GST-Tax was 20-fold higher than that observed with either the GST-Tax M32 activation mutant or the GST control .
Third , a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that in HTLV-1-infected human T lymphocytes , Tax and TFIIA were associated .
Finally , TFIIA facilitates Tax transactivation in vitro and in vivo .
In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of Tax-activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of TFIIA .
In addition , transfection of human T lymphocytes with TFIIA expression vectors enhanced Tax-activated transcription of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct .
Our study suggests that the interaction of Tax with the transcription factor TFIIA may play a role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation .
Anergic CD4+ Th cells do not produce IL-2 when challenged with Ag-pulsed accessory cells because of a transcriptional defect .
In this work , we report that these anergic T cells are defective in their ability to up-regulate protein binding and transactivation at two critical IL-2 DNA enhancer elements : NF-AT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ; a sequence that binds a heterotrimeric NFATp , Fos , and Jun protein complex ) and Activator Protein-1 ( AP-1 ) ( that binds Fos and Jun heterodimers ) .
Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that the impaired DNA-protein interactions in anergic T cells were associated with poor expression of the inducible AP-1 family members c-Fos , FosB , and JunB .
However , the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global TCR/CD3-signaling defect because CD3 cross-linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular-free calcium ions , as well as NFATp dephosphorylation , translocation to the nucleus , and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells .
Thus , defective IL-2 gene transcription appears to be due , at least in part , to a selective block in the expression of the AP-1 Fos and Jun family members in anergic T cells .
The extent to which peptides containing chemically and post-translationally modified amino acid side chains are recognized by primed CTL has not been clearly defined .
We report on the CTL recognition of a MHC class I-restricted peptide containing a cyclized asparagine ( succinimide ) residue .
This modification of the asparagine side chain is a common intermediate structure during deamidation , isomerization , and bond rearrangements of amide-containing amino acids and also occurs as a side reaction in peptide synthesis .
The CTL specifically recognized the succinimide-containing peptide showing only weak cross-reactivity at high concentrations of the parent peptide containing unmodified asparagine .
Similarly , CTL raised against the parent peptide did not recognize the succinimide derivative of this peptide .
Naturally processed forms of these structures are likely to occur given the importance and frequency of deamidation both in vitro and in vivo .
Moreover , since succinimide intermediates of deamidated peptides can occasionally be very stable , these peptides have the potential to act as altered self-Ags with significant implications for autoimmunity .
In addition , unwanted and potentially hazardous specificities may be elicited when using synthetic peptides in subunit vaccines in which succinimide residues may form spontaneously during storage or chemical synthesis .
The induction of T cell proliferation requires signals from the TCR and a co-receptor molecule , such as CD28 , that activate parallel and partially cross-reactive signaling pathways .
These pathways are disrupted by agonists that utilize adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
We found that the adenylate cyclase activator , forskolin , inhibits anti-CD3-induced shift in Lck electrophoretic mobility , suggesting an intervention at the TCR-coupled phosphoinositide turnover that precedes the activation of PKC .
The shift of Lck following direct PKC activation by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate , which bypasses early receptor-triggered biochemical events , is insensitive to forskolin .
Nevertheless , forskolin also inhibits PKC downstream events , such as c-jun expression , which is critical for the activation process of T cells .
To further analyze potential cross points between positively and negatively regulating signaling pathways in T cells , we tested the effects of activators of the adenylate cyclase or PKA on two parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase .
Using a PKC-specific inhibitor , GF109203X , or PKC-depleted T cells , we found that a large part of the anti-CD3-induced ERK activation is PKC dependent .
Both PKC- dependent and -independent activation of ERK were sensitive to inhibition by forskolin or a cell-permeable cAMP analogue , dbcAMP .
Furthermore , the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and ionomycin , which synergized to fully activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase , was also sensitive to inhibition by forskolin .
Our results suggest that PKA inhibits T cell activation by interfering with multiple events along the two signaling pathways operating downstream of the TCR and the CD28 co-receptor molecules .
B-cell-specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes is mediated by the interaction of a POU domain containing transcription factor Oct-1 or Oct-2 , with the B-cell-specific coactivator OCA-B ( Bob-1 , OBF-1 ) and a prototype octamer element .
We find that OCA-B binds DNA directly in the major groove between the two subdomains of the POU domain , requiring both an A at the fifth position of the octamer element and contact with the POU domain .
An amino-terminal fragment of OCA-B binds the octamer site in the absence of a POU domain with the same sequence specificity .
Coactivator OCA-B may undergo a POU-dependent conformational change that exposes its amino terminus , allowing it to recognize specific DNA sequences in the major groove within the binding site for Oct-1 or Oct-2 .
The recognition of both the POU domain and the octamer sequence by OCA-B provides a mechanism for differential regulation of octamer sites containing genes by the ubiquitous factor Oct-1 .
Based on the presence of T cell receptor-beta ( TcR-beta ) gene rearrangements in L428 and HDLM-1 cells , the expression of CD2 in HDLM-1 cells , and the presence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene rearrangement in KM-H2 cells , some researchers have concluded that these long-term cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin 's disease are lymphoid in nature .
The information obtained from these cell lines has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of H-RS cells in tissue despite the frequent absence of lymphoid markers and Ig/TcR gene rearrangements in these cells .
We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of lymphoid markers or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that H-RS cells have a lymphoid origin , because these markers may be aberrant in tumor cells .
In this study , we examined the expression of two T-cell-specific transcription factors ( TCF-1 and GATA-3 ) and one B-cell-specific transcription factor ( BSAP ) in cultured H-RS cells by using a gel mobility shift assay .
The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of cell lineage have been established in a large number of cultured human and murine cell lines .
All three types of H-RS cell lines were consistently negative for BSAP , TCF-1 , and GATA-3 .
The absence of GATA-3 was confirmed in H-RS cells in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique .
Virtually all B-cell lines , with the exception of some myeloma cell lines , are positive for BSAP , which is the transcription factor for promoters for several B-cell markers , including VpreB1 , lambda 5 , CD19 , and CD20 .
All T-cell lines tested were positive for TCF-1 and GATA-3 , which are the transcription factors for promoters for several T-cell-restricted markers , including CD2 , CD3 , TcR , and lck .
The absence of BSAP , TCF-1 , and GATA-3 clearly indicates an underlying difference between H-RS cells and lymphoid cells .
BCL-2-deficient T cells demonstrate accelerated cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis following activation .
Increasing the levels of BCL-2 retarded the G0 --> S transition , sustained the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 , and repressed postactivation death .
Proximal signal transduction events and immediate early gene transcription were unaffected .
However , the transcription and synthesis of interleukin 2 and other delayed early cytokines were markedly attenuated by BCL-2 .
In contrast , a cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks apoptosis had no substantial affect upon cytokine production .
InterleUkin 2 expression requires several transcription factors of which nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) and NFAT-mediated transactivation were impaired by BCL-2 .
Thus , select genetic aberrations in the apoptotic pathway reveal a cell autonomous coregulation of activation .
Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) protease in cultured cells leads to apoptosis , preceded by cleavage of bcl-2 , a key negative regulator of cell death .
In contrast , a high level of bcl-2 protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevents cell death following HIV infection of human lymphocytes , while reducing the yields of viral structural proteins , infectivity , and tumor necrosis factor alpha .
We present a model for HIV replication in which the viral protease depletes the infected cells of bcl-2 , leading to oxidative stress-dependent activation of NF kappa B , a cellular factor required for HIV transcription , and ultimately to cell death .
Purified bcl-2 is cleaved by HIV protease between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 .
The results suggest a new option for HIV gene therapy ; bcl-2 muteins that have noncleavable alterations surrounding the HIV protease cleavage site .
Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB , whereas other receptors ( c-Kit/Epo-R ) regulate erythroid differentiation .
To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of c-ErbB , we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family .
Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA-binding , and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5b in erythroblasts .
In contrast , ligand activation of c-Kit was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells .
Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b , but failed to induce reporter gene transcription .
These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c-ErbB to cause sustained self renewal in erythroid progenitors .
The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 have been widely used to prevent and treat graft rejection after human organ and tissue transplantations .
CsA and FK506 associate with intracellular binding proteins ( i.e. , CsA with cyclophilin A and FK506 with FKBP12 ) to form protein/drug complexes that suppress the immune system by preventing activation of T cells in response to antigen presentation .
The common target of CsA and FK506 is calcineurin , a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated , serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase that regulates the nuclear import of a transcription factor , NF-AT , required for expression of T cell activation genes .
In previous studies , we identified calcineurin mutations that block binding by the cyclophilin A/CsA or FKBP12/FK506 complexes and thereby render yeast cells resistant to the antifungal effects of CsA or FK506 .
In this report , we demonstrate that the corresponding mutations in murine calcineurin render the T cell receptor signal transduction cascade CsA resistant in human Jurkat T cells .
Our findings support the recently determined calcineurin X-ray crystal structure , provide evidence that calcineurin is the only CsA-sensitive component limiting signaling from the T cell receptor to the nucleus , and suggest a means to render cells and tissues resistant to the toxic side effects of CsA and FK506 .
Transcription factor NF kappa B ( nuclear factor kappa B ) is induced in T lymphocytes from young individuals following activation with a variety of stimuli including anti-CD3 , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
In contrast , activated T lymphocytes from older individuals show a significant reduction in the induction of NF kappa B in response to the same stimuli .
The age-related decline in induction of NF kappa B could not be attributed to alteration in the composition of subunits , p50 and p65 were found to be the predominant subunits of induced NF kappa B in T cells from young as well as elderly donors .
Furthermore , similar levels of NF kappa B were found in the cytosols of unactivated T cells from both young and elderly donors suggesting that precursor levels of NF kappa B remain unaltered during aging .
These results suggest that an age-associated decline in the induction of NF kappa B in activated T cells from elderly individuals may be attributable to altered regulation of the inhibitor , I kappa B , and may play an important role in immune dysregulation accompanying aging .
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has been etiologically associated with the development of the adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) as well as degenerative neurologic syndrome termed tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) .
HTLV-I encodes a potent transactivator protein termed Tax that appears to play an important role in the process of T-cell immortalization .
Even though the mechanisms by which Tax induces transformation are still unknown , it seems likely that the ability of Tax to alter the expression of many cellular genes plays an important part in this process .
Tax does not bind directly to DNA but rather deregulates the activity of cellular transcription factors .
One family of host transcription factors whose activity is altered by Tax includes NF-kappa B/Rel .
These transcription factors are post-transcriptionally regulated by their assembly with a second family of inhibitory proteins termed I kappa B that serve to sequester the NF-kappa B/Rel complexes in the cytoplasm .
Upon cellular activation , I kappa B alpha is phosphorylated , polyubiquitinated , and degraded in the proteasome .
This proteolytic event liberates NF-kappa B , permitting its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it binds to its cognate enhancer elements .
Similarly , the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit is also post-translationally processed in the proteasome .
The mechanisms by which Tax activates NF-kappa B remain unclear , and findings presented in the literature are often controversial .
We identified a physical interaction between Tax and the HsN3 subunit of the human proteasome .
This raises the intriguing possibility that physical association of the HsN3 proteasome subunit with HTLV-I Tax coupled with the independent interaction of Tax with either p100 or p65-I kappa B alpha targets these cytoplasmic NF-kappa B/Rel complexes to the proteasome for processing .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B-cell malignancies .
Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology .
Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas .
It is known that expression of a single viral immediate-early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells .
Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency .
Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate-early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .
Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific .
IL13 induces the same biological effects as IL4 in normal human B cells .
We show that as in the IL4R complex , both IL4R alpha and IL2R gamma c are components of the IL13R and that both cytokines induced STAT6 , STAT3 and STAT5 activation in B cells .
In spite of this similar downstream signalling , IL4 and IL13 used a different set of Janus kinases : IL13 is unable to activate JAK1 and JAK3 .
The molecular mechanism underlying IL-2 transcriptional blockade in anergic T cell clones is not fully understood .
To examine whether an active negative regulatory process occurs , we created a reporter construct containing as an enhancer four copies of the NF-AT site and one copy of the octamer site ( 4X NF-AT-Oct ) .
This construct was only slightly reduced ( 1.3-fold ) in its expression when stimulated under anergic conditions , while a whole mouse IL-2 enhancer construct showed a reduction of 4.3-fold .
Addition of the -176 to -96 sequence to the 4X NF-AT-Oct construct did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy , but addition of the -236 to -96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the -150 AP-1 binding site ( -152 to -147 ) is required to mediate the effect .
Mutational studies of the -236 to -96 sequence indicated that the presence of both the -130 AP-1-like site ( -187 to -181 ) and the -150 proximal AP-1 site were necessary to observe anergy .
Because the -180 site is not required for trans-activation , it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL-2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction .
The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple transcription factors that exert a cis-acting dominant negative regulatory effect on the trans-activation of the IL-2 gene .
GM-CSF gene activation in T cells is known to involve the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and Sp1 .
Here we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF promoter and enhancer also encompass binding sites for core-binding factor ( CBF ) .
Significantly , the CBF sites are in each case contained within the minimum essential core regions required for inducible activation of transcription .
Furthermore , these core regions of the enhancer and promoter each encompass closely linked binding sites for CBF , AP-1 , and NFATp .
The GM-CSF promoter CBF site TGTGGTCA is located 51 bp upstream of the transcription start site and also overlaps a YY-1 binding site .
A 2-bp mutation within the CBF site resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in the activities of both a 69-bp proximal promoter fragment and a 627-bp full-length promoter fragment .
Stepwise deletions into the proximal promoter also revealed that the CBF site , but not the YY-1 site , was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation .
The AML1 and CBF beta genes that encode CBF each have the ability to influence cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated as proto-oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia .
This study adds GM-CSF to a growing list of cytokines and receptors that are regulated by CBF and which control the growth , differentiation , and activation of hemopoietic cells .
The GM-CSF locus may represent one of several target genes that are dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia .
The human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene is one of the earliest genes transcribed after the stimulation of a B cell through its antigen receptor or via the CD-40 pathway .
In both cases , induction of TNF-alpha gene transcription can be blocked by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 , which suggested a role for the NFAT family of proteins in the regulation of the gene in B cells .
Furthermore , in T cells , two molecules of NFATp bind to the TNF-alpha promoter element kappa 3 in association with ATF-2 and Jun proteins bound to an immediately adjacent cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) site .
Here , using the murine B-cell lymphoma cell line A20 , we show that the TNF-alpha gene is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner .
In A20 B cells , the TNF-alpha gene is not regulated by NFATp bound to the kappa 3 element .
Instead , ATF-2 and Jun proteins bind to the composite kappa 3/CRE site and NFATp binds to a newly identified second NFAT site centered at -76 nucleotides relative to the TNF-alpha transcription start site .
This new site plays a critical role in the calcium-mediated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of TNF-alpha in both A20 B cells and Ar-5 cells .
Consistent with these results , quantitative DNase footprinting of the TNF-alpha promoter using increasing amounts of recombinant NFATp demonstrated that the -76 site binds to NFATp with a higher affinity than the kappa 3 site .
Two other previously unrecognized NFATp-binding sites in the proximal TNF-alpha promoter were also identified by this analysis .
Thus , through the differential use of the same promoter element , the composite kappa 3/CRE site , the TNF-alpha gene is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner in response to the same extracellular signal .
Three subtypes of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) , termed RAR alpha , RAR beta , and RAR gamma , have been described .
They are composed of different structural domains , including distinct domains for DNA and ligand binding .
RARs specifically bind all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA ) , 9-cis-RA , and retinoid analogs .
In this study , we examined the functional role of cysteine and arginine residues in the ligand-binding domain of hRAR alpha ( hRAR alpha-LBD , amino acids 154 to 462 ) .
All conserved cysteine and arginine residues in this domain were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis , and the mutant proteins were characterized by blocking reactions , ligand-binding experiments , transactivation assays , and protease mapping .
Changes of any cysteine residue of the hRAR alpha-LBD had no significant influence on the binding of all-trans RA or 9-cis RA .
Interestingly , residue C-235 is specifically important in antagonist binding .
With respect to arginine residues , only the two single mutations of R-276 and R-394 to alanine showed a dramatic decrease of agonist and antagonist binding whereas the R272A mutation showed only a slight effect .
For all other arginine mutations , no differences in affinity were detectable .
The two mutations R217A and R294A caused an increased binding efficiency for antagonists but no change in agonist binding .
From these results , we can conclude that electrostatic interactions of retinoids with the RAR alpha-LBD play a significant role in ligand binding .
In addition , antagonists show distinctly different requirements for efficient binding , which may contribute to their interference in the ligand-inducible transactivation function of RAR alpha .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced maturation mediated by the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) has been implicated in myeloid development .
We have used differential hybridization analysis of a cDNA library constructed from the murine RA-inducible MPRO promyelocyte cell line to identify immediate-early genes induced by RA during granulocytic differentiation .
E3 , one of nine sequences identified , was upregulated in an immediate-early manner , with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to RA .
E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells , but not in an RA-resistant subclone , HL60R , that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene .
However , when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the RAR alpha gene , RA induced a 10-fold increase in E3 mRNA levels .
E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid , B-lymphoid , and erythroid lineages , absent in nonhematopoietic cells , and encode a highly hydrophobic , potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in myeloid cells .
The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite retinoic acid response element which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity .
These results indicate that E3 is a hematopoietic-specific gene that is an immediate target for the activated RAR alpha during myelopoiesis .
An acquired deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a recurrent abnormality in myeloproliferative disorders , particularly polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic syndromes .
The association of 20q deletions with myeloid " stem cell " disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes , loss or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of normal hematopoietic progenitors .
We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions in peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes and defined a commonly deleted region of 16 to 21 centimorgan ( cM ) .
To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics .
We have studied 48 patients with polycythemia vera and four patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis .
In each case , cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20 .
Seventeen microsatellite markers that span the common deleted region were used to search for loss of heterozygosity in granulocyte DNA .
No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA .
Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhibited allele loss on 20q .
In each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at distal markers was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity .
Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone .
Therefore , the human androgen receptor assay ( HUMARA ) was used to determine granulocyte clonality .
In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the granulocytes were clonally derived .
In 5 patients the granulocytes appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both granulocytes and T cells .
These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here , the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes .
Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder .
To define novel proteins involved in the early transcriptional response during the activation of human T lymphocytes , we used a high-resolution , two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system to identify nuclear , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) binding proteins exhibiting rapid changes in phosphorylation following cell stimulation .
We identified 18 nuclear proteins whose phosphorylation level changed more than 5-fold upon activation .
Of these , 11 were found to possess DNA-binding properties .
The 11 phosphoproteins with DNA-binding activity , along with 4 others , were analyzed further .
Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed several sets of proteins with different phosphorylated residues Kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of the selected proteins was performed and revealed a complex group of transient and sustained responses to cell activation .
Finally , the activation-induced changes in one set of phosphoproteins were dramatically inhibited by cyclosporin A .
We suggest that these phosphoproteins may be directly involved in regulating the transcriptional response to cellular activation by external stimuli .
A model of adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) infection was developed in guinea pigs to begin to study its role in the pathogenesis of peripheral lung inflammation .
Forty animals were inoculated intranasally with 10(7.0) pfu of Ad5/animal , and 15 animals inoculated with sterile culture media served as controls .
Viral titres were 10(4.4) , 10(6.1) , 10(5.2) , and 10(2.9) pfu/animal , on days 1 , 3 , 4 , and 7 after infection , respectively .
In situ hybridization to viral DNA and immunocytochemistry for Ad5 E1A protein localized the virus to airway and alveolar epithelial cells .
Histologic examination showed an extensive inflammatory cell infiltration around the airways , with epithelial necrosis and an alveolar exudate that caused localized alveolar collapse in the infected areas .
Immunocytochemistry identified the cells in the infiltrate as cytotoxic T cells .
Although all animals 20 and 47 days after infection had seroconverted to Ad5 , virus was not detected in these groups either by viral plaque assay or in situ hybridization .
Ad5 E1A DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in five of six animals 20 days after infection and in five of five animals 47 days after infection .
In these same animals , E1A protein was detected 20 days after infection in two and 47 days after infection in one while persistent bronchiolitis was observed in four and three animals 20 and 47 days after infection , respectively .
These results demonstrate that the guinea pig provides a useful model to study the role of Ad5 infection in chronic airway inflammation .
The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B is involved in the inducible expression of various inflammatory genes as well as in HIV-1 replication .
Activation of NF-kappa B is induced by prooxidants and several stimuli eliciting oxidative stress , such as cytokines , lipopolysaccharide , UV irradiation and other mediators .
Various antioxidants inhibit NF-kappa B activation in response to these stimuli .
In this study , we have investigated the effects of selenium , an integral component of glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) , on NF-kappa B activation .
In selenium-deprived Jurkat and ESb-L T lymphocytes , supplementation of selenium led to a substantial increase of GPX activity .
Analysis of DNA binding revealed that NF-kappa B activation in response to TNF was significantly inhibited under these conditions .
Likewise , reporter gene assays using luciferase constructs driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat showed a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B controlled gene expression by selenium .
The effects of selenium were specific for NF-kappa B , since the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 was not suppressed .
These data suggest that selenium supplementation may be used to modulate the expression of NF-kappa B target genes and HIV-1 .
We studied the role of the immediate early gene c-jun in cell proliferation and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced differentiation in U937 human monoblastic cells , using c-jun-specific antisense ( AS ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides .
In selecting the most specific and potent oligonucleotide sequence , we performed extensive analyses for the binding specificity between all candidates of c-jun AS oligonucleotides and the whole sequences in GenBank database , using a computer program .
Among the 20 selected oligonucleotides , two potent 15-mer AS oligonucleotides ( C-JUN AS oligonucleotides ) exhibited significant inhibition of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner between 2 and 10 microM .
Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that 10 microM of C-JUN AS oligonucleotides reduced c-jun expression at both the mRNA and protein levels .
More importantly , C-JUN AS oligonucleotides showed distinct effects on two markers of PMA-induced differentiation ; the C-JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion , whereas they did not affect another marker of differentiation , respiratory burst ( measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay ) .
These results suggest a critical role of c-jun in both cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but not in PMA-induced respiratory burst in U937 cells .
We describe two female monozygotic ( MZ ) twins heterozygous for Fabry disease , an X linked disorder resulting from the deficient activity of alpha-galactosidase A .
While one of the twins was clinically affected , the other was asymptomatic .
Enzymatic assay of alpha-galactosidase in blood leucocytes , skin fibroblasts , Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoid cell lines , and hair follicles of the twins and their parents confirmed the heterozygous status of the twins and indicated that Fabry disease had occurred as a result of a de novo mutation .
The son of the unaffected twin sister was shown to be hemizygous .
Molecular analysis of the alpha-galactosidase A gene permitted the identification of an as yet undescribed point mutation at position 10182 of exon 5 which causes an Asp to Asn substitution at codon 231 .
Single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis again showed the heterozygous status of the twins and a normal pattern in their parents .
The basis for the discordant expression of this d novo mutation in the twins was investigated by studying their X inactivation status .
Analysis of the inactive X specific methylation at the androgen receptor gene showed unbalanced inactivation in the twins ' fibroblasts and in opposite directions .
While the maternally derived X chromosome was preferentially active in the asymptomatic twin , the paternal X chromosome was active in the other , affected twin and was found in her hemizygotic nephew .
These data suggest that the paternal X chromosome carries the de novo alpha-galactosidase A mutation and that uneven X inactivation is the underlying mechanism for disease expression in this novel female MZ twin pair .
This is the first documented case of female twins discordant for Fabry disease .
From a murine B-cell cDNA-library we have cloned a cDNA encoding the murine B-cell specific coactivator mBob1 .
The protein is the murine homologue to the recently described human coactivator Bob1 ( hBob1 ) , also referred to as OBF-1 or OCA-B .
We have also characterized the genomic mBob1 clone .
Analysis of its intron-exon structure has allowed identification of a C-terminal splice variant .
mBob1 is B-cell restricted , and is found in all B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell differentiation .
mBob1 interacts with the octamer transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 and stimulates transcription mediated by these factors .
Eosinophils play an important role in the effector phase of allergic inflammation .
This review will focus on the conversion of the unprimed eosinophil phenotype in the peripheral blood of normal individuals to the primed phenotype found in the peripheral blood and tissues of allergic patients , a phenomenon called priming .
Recent data on the signals initiated after cytokine receptor activation on eosinophils will be reviewed .
Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation , the molecular mechanism ( s ) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated .
Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) as adhesion molecules are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions .
We observed that in a monocytic ( U937 ) and a bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell-line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced ICAM-1 expression .
Subsequent analysis of the human ICAM-1 promoter has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) upregulate ICAM-1 expression through the presence of a nuclear factor ( NF-kappa B ) target sequence ( TGGAAATTCC ) .
No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF-alpha upon transfection in 293 cells .
We propose that direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and nuclear factor-kappa B factors is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases .
Direct evidence that N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) enhances the immune response of peripheral blood T cells at the level of NF(kappa)B is presented .
In addition , NAC blocks the suppression of T cell mitogenesis and cytokine production by protease inhibitors such as N-tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) .
The proliferative responses of purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when anti-CD28 rather than the phorbol ester PMA is used as the mitogenic coactivator .
Cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-6 , INF-gamma ) production is inhibited 95-100 % by concentrations of TPCK that totally suppress the mitogenesis of CD4+ or CD8+ cells .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we find that TPCK virtually abolishes ( to less than 1 % ) the levels of NF(kappa)B ( but not Oct-1 ) found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of activated T cells .
Strikingly , the immunosuppressive effects of TPCK are blocked when T cells are pretreated for 15 min with 5 mM NAC .
NAC not only blocks the effect of TPCK but enhances mitogenesis and cytokine production ( > 2.5-fold in some cases ) upon activation of unsuppressed T cells .
Our data support the notion that NF(kappa)B and I(kappa)B proteases play obligate roles in T cell activation and mitogenesis , roles that are enhanced significantly by NAC .
The responses of lymphocytes to IL-2 and IL-12 , involving proliferation , differentiation , and cytokine production , are only partially overlapping , and may depend on induced differential expression of specific sets of genes .
Using reverse-transcription PCR differential display , we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL-2- but not IL-12-stimulated NK cells .
This was identified as the mRNA encoding the transcription factor egr-1 , which is expressed with fast kinetics in T and NK cells upon IL-2 , but not IL-12 , stimulation .
Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2 , but not IL-12 , whereas expression of c-jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine .
Accordingly , increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity were detected exclusively in IL-2-stimulated cells .
Analysis of the expression of genes reported to regulate cytokine-induced proliferation demonstrated that both IL-2 and IL-12 induce c-myc mRNA accumulation in NK and T cells , whereas only IL-2 induces bcl-2 expression .
Our data provide the first demonstration that IL-12-mediated activation of T and NK cells does not involve expression of members of the immediate-early activation genes family ( egr-1 , c-fos , and junB ) , AP-1 transcriptional activity , or bcl-2 expression .
This indicates that functional differences observed in IL-2- and IL-12-stimulated cells may depend , at least in part , on differential gene regulation .
A major obstacle in understanding the signaling events that follow CD28 receptor ligation arises from the fact that CD28 acts as a costimulus to TCR engagement , making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of CD28 signals as distinct from those of the TCR .
To overcome this problem , we have exploited the observation that activated human T cell blasts can be stimulated via the CD28 surface molecule in the absence of antigenic challenge ; thus , we have been able to observe the response of normal T cells to CD28 activation in isolation .
Using this system , we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was not accompanied by measurable IL-2 production .
However , subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) complexes , but not NF-AT .
In contrast , engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen , either with or without CD28 ligation , resulted in the induction of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production .
Using selective inhibitors , we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the CD28-mediated induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB .
This revealed that NF-kappaB generation was sensitive to chloroquine , an inhibitor of acidic sphingomyelinase , but not to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor , wortmannin .
In contrast , AP-1 generation was inhibited by wortmannin and was also variably sensitive to chloroquine .
These data suggest that in activated normal T cells , CD28-derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF-kappaB and AP-1 generation , and that this response uses both acidic sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-linked pathways .
This study was designed to determine the potential cis-elements involved in transcriptional regulation of the mouse perforin gene .
DNase I hypersensitive site ( DHS ) mapping revealed that the perforin locus contained six DHS within 7.0 kb of the 5' upstream sequence ( -7.0 kb ) and two DHS in intron 2 .
The six 5' upstream and one intronic DHS were detected in only perforin-expressing lymphocytes .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activities directed by 5' upstream promoter were detected preferentially in perforin-expressing cell lines .
A construct termed PFP5a containing -795 bp exhibited the highest CAT activity , and PFP9a20 containing only -73 bp also produced significantly high CAT activity in CTLL-R8 cells .
The proximal region in PFP9a20 contained two potential Sp1 binding sites ( GC box and GT box ) and one Ets binding site ( EBS ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that each of the cis-elements bound specific protein factors .
When single-point mutation was introduced to each GC box , EBS , and GT box in PFP9a20 , at least 3-fold less CAT activity was observed in CTLL-R8 cells .
To confirm the importance of the three cis-acting elements in the perforin gene expression , point mutation was introduced again to each proximal GC box , EBS , and GT box of PFP5a .
The point mutations resulted in a 2.5- to 3-fold reduction of CAT activity .
The results suggest that a combination of the three proximal cis-acting elements may constitute a minimal region responsible for CTL-specific expression of perforin .
We have studied the proliferation and CD40 antigen expression of lymphocytes , and the cytotoxicity to monocytes , of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the SP II promoter of HBV mRNA ( sequence I ) and the X gene ( sequence II ) in patients with chronic hepatitis B .
The oligo sequence I stimulated proliferation of both T and , to a lesser extent , B cells .
The percentage of cells expressing CD40 in T and B cell co-cultures increased from 4.2 % to 13.8 % after oligo stimulation in patients , while it increased form 4.7 % to 48.6 % in healthy controls .
The sense sequence ( sequence III ) of the X gene also enhanced the expression of CD40 antigen in patients with hepatitis B .
The proportion of CD40 cells ( 26 % ) in a resting B-cell preparation from hepatitis B patients decreased to zero after a 5-day culture with sequence I , but IgG levels in the culture supernatant increased .
The cytotoxic properties of monocytes were not influenced by the oligos .
These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of human lymphocytes in a non-specific manner and may activate T cells to express CD40 antigen .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , also known as type II interferon , is an important immunoregulatory gene that has multiple effects on the development , maturation , and function of the immune system .
IFN-gamma mRNA and protein are expressed predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes .
The IFN-gamma mRNA is induced/inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals , thus implicating a number of diverse , yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control .
In this review , I describe how DNA methylation and specific DNA binding proteins may regulate transcription of the IFN-gamma gene in response to extracellular signals .
SLP-76 ( SH2 domain leukocyte protein of 76 kDa ) is a recently identified substrate of the TCR-stimulated protein tyrosine kinases that functions in the signal transduction cascade linking the TCR with IL-2 gene expression .
In this report , we demonstrate that engagement of the TCR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 in its amino-terminal acidic region .
Two tyrosines ( Y113 and Y128 ) fall within an identical five amino-acid motif and are shown to be phosphorylated upon TCR ligation .
Although mutation of either Y113 and Y128 has a minimal effect on SLP-76 function , mutation of both residues decreases significantly the ability of SLP-76 to promote T cell activation .
A third tyrosine within the amino-terminal region ( Y145 ) appears to be the most important for optimal SLP-76 function , as altering it alone to phenylalanine has a potent impact on SLP-76 augmentation of NFAT promoter activity .
The murine fra-1 gene , encoding Fos-related Ag 1 , was isolated from a splenic cDNA library and sequenced .
Murine fra-1 was highly homologous to rat and human fra-1 .
Oligonucleotide primers based on the murine sequence were used to construct a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay for gene expression .
B lymphocyte stimulation via both CD40 and surface Ig ( sIg ) receptors substantially induced fra-1 expression , and for both receptors , induction was protein kinase C ( PKC ) dependent .
This contrasts with induction of c-fos by both CD40 and sIg , which is PKC independent and indicates that CD40 is capable of signaling through PKC or a closely related kinase .
Induction of fra-1 following engagement of CD40 did not require protein synthesis , suggesting that the PKC-dependent linkage between CD40 and fra-1 is direct .
CD40-mediated fra-1 induction did require tyrosine kinase activity .
These results demonstrate that CD40 , like sIg , may employ PKC in producing select outcomes , that individual B cell receptors may signal downstream events via both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways , and that multiple signal transduction pathways may be used to activate the expression of closely related genes .
Treatment of the acute promyelocytic ( APL ) cell line NB4 with interferon alpha ( IFN(alpha) ) , as well as IFN(beta) and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha ( RAR(alpha) ) and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor PML-RAR .
Transcriptional induction of the RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR mRNAs is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins .
Up-regulation of RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR gene expression by IFN(alpha) is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers , i.e. , granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor mRNA and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase .
However , IFN(alpha) does not have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33 .
The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells , since the phenomena are not observed in HL-60 promyelocytes .
Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells , although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity .
These results suggest the possible use of combinations between IFNs and retinoic acid in the cyto-differentiating treatment of APL patients .
In this study the genetic control of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene expression during the transition from B cell to plasma cell has been analyzed .
Class II molecules are not expressed in plasma cells because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription .
We show here that the plasma cell-specific repressor function , designated SIR ( suppressor of immune response genes ) , does not act directly on the transcription of class II genes , but instead on the transcription of the AIR-1 gene , whose product , the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes .
This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR-1 locus derived from CIITA-expressing cells do not express CIITA-specific transcripts .
Transfection of a cDNA containing the human CIITA coding sequence under the control of an heterologous promoter restores expression of human MHC class II genes in the hybrids and is responsible for de novo expression of mouse MHC class II genes in both the mouse plasmacytoma cell line and the hybrids .
These results confirm and extend the notion of the functional conservation of the AIR-1 gene product across species barriers .
Interestingly , in CIITA-transfected cell hybrids , cell surface expression of the human HLA-DQ heterodimer was not observed .
This result was not attributable to lack of HLA-DQ alpha or -DQ beta transcription , because both transcripts were present in the CIITA-transfected hybrids , although at reduced levels .
These findings further support our previous observations on the distinct regulation of expression of the human HLA-DQ class II subset , which may be thus controlled at the posttranscriptional level by a CIITA-independent mechanism .
Chromosome 1 abnormalities with loss of 1p36 have been investigated in 95 breast-cancer samples by means of a dual-target fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique using the pUC 1.77 and p1-79 probes , specific for the 1q12 and 1p36 regions , respectively .
Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83/95 samples .
Relative 1p36 under-representation was found in 79/95 .
The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast-cancer pathology .
Distinct patterns of chromosome 1 abnormalities were found among the histologic types of breast carcinoma .
Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations , whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under-representation of 1p36 .
In ductal carcinomas , chromosome 1 alterations increased with histologic grade , DNA aneuploidy , loss of bcl-2 and high c-erb B-2 expression .
These associations were found to be statistically significant .
No correlation between chromosome 1 alterations and nuclear grade , age , size , lymph-node involvement , hormonal receptor presence , proliferation activity or p53 protein expression was detected .
These results indicate the utility of this FISH technique for a better definition of the biological characteristics of ductal carcinomas .
Nasal T/NK-cell lymphomas can be further separated into those of natural killer ( NK ) cell lineage or of T-cell lineage , with differences in cellular phenotype , T-cell receptor ( TcR ) gene rearrangement and TcR transcript expression .
Both NK- and T-cell subtypes are closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
In this study , EBV gene expression was determined in 23 cases of nasal lymphoma ( NL ) by in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) , reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IH ) .
Of the 23 cases , 19 were classified as NK-cell and 4 as T-cell tumours .
ISH for EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs showed that all cases , whether NK or T , harboured EBV in virtually all tumour cells .
RT-PCR demonstrated that NL of both subtypes expressed EBNAI of the QUK splice pattern , the latent membrane proteins , LMP1 and 2 and the BamHI A rightward transcripts in the absence of EBNA2 mRNAs , compatible with the latency type II pattern .
In addition , analysis of EBV protein expression by IH revealed a heterogeneous pattern of EBV gene expression at the single-cell level consisting of both LMP1+ and LMP1- tumour cells , suggesting a mixture of latency I and II .
Although 2 early lytic transcripts , BZLF1 and BHRF1 , were also detected in 13 and 10 cases , respectively , the lack of ZEBRA staining in any case indicates that these lytic transcripts are most likely expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle .
The viral transcriptional pattern similar to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin 's disease suggests that EBV can exploit common regulatory mechanisms for gene transcription in diverse host cell types .
Down-regulation of immunogenic proteins ( EBNA2-EBNA6 ) in nasal lymphoma may enable tumour cells to evade host cytotoxic T-cell surveillance .
Estrogen may participate in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) via its intracellular receptor .
To investigate the presence of various isoforms of the estrogen receptor ( ER ) in SLE we isolated RNA from mononuclear cells of lupus patients and normal controls .
Using RT-PCR we were able to identify both the full length wild-type form and an isoform of the ER which precisely lacks exon V in both patient and normal individuals .
Our results , although limited , suggest that normal individuals can express both the wild-type and truncated version at the same time , whereas lupus patients only express either the wild-type or the truncated ER .
This finding may lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the prevalence of lupus in females and of the estrogenic effects on SLE disease activity .
IL-12 is a powerful skewer of CD4+ T cell responses toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing IFN-gamma production in naive Th cells .
In the present study we addressed the question of whether IL-12 can reverse established Th2 responses into Th1/Th0 responses by inducing IFN-gamma production in memory Th2 cells .
To this aim , allergen-specific CD4+ T cell clones ( TCC ) were generated from the peripheral blood of three atopic patients , and their cytokine profiles were analyzed .
The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile , and the production of IFN-gamma could not be induced by exogenous IL-12 .
Only those TCC with low IFN-gamma levels in the absence of IL-12 responded to IL-12 by additional enhancement of IFN-gamma production .
The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 ) , a transcription factor that is typically involved in IL-12 signaling .
Consequently , IL-12 also failed to induce the DNA-binding activity of STAT4-containing complexes in the nuclei of these Th2 clones .
All TCC expressed equal levels of the low-affinity IL-12R beta1 subunit .
Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profiles do not respond to IL-12 and , therefore , can not be induced to produce IFN-gamma .
The apparent high frequency of IL-12-nonresponsive Th cells within the allergen-specific populations in atopic patients predicts a limited skewing potential of IL-12 in the case of established Th2 responses , but only affecting newly recruited naive Th cells .
The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene ( RAR alpha ) in the acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) 15 ; 17 translocation .
PML is expressed in diverse tissues and cell lines and localized in the nucleus with a typical speckled pattern .
In the bone marrow , it is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells .
PML appears to be transcriptionally regulated by class I and II interferons , which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal myeloid cells and precursors by activating PML-dependent pathways .
Similarly , interferons could act on APL cells , alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) , especially if the PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript that results from the t(15; 17) is induced by interferon .
We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating human monocytes , lymphocytes , and polymorphonucleate cells , but is markedly induced by interferon ; that PML and PML/RAR alpha expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line , which carries the t(15; 17) , and in APL blasts from patients ; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA ; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells ; and , finally , that interferon gamma , but not alpha or beta , induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance , and partially restores RA response .
We previously showed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) stimulate the differentiation of human monocytes into two phenotypically distinct types of macrophages .
However , in vivo , not only CSF but also many other cytokines are produced under various conditions .
Those cytokines may modulate the differentiation of monocytes by CSFs .
In the present study , we showed that CD14+ adherent human monocytes can differentiate into CD1+relB+ dendritic cells ( DC ) by the combination of GM-CSF plus interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and that they differentiate into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) -positive osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells ( MGC ) by the combination of M-CSF plus IL-4 .
However , the monocyte-derived DC were not terminally differentiated cells ; they could still convert to macrophages in response to M-CSF .
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) stimulated the terminal differentiation of the DC by downregulating the expression of the M-CSF receptor , cfms mRNA , and aborting the potential to convert to macrophages .
In contrast to IL-4 , interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) had no demonstrable effect on the differentiation of monocytes .
Rather , IFN-gamma antagonized the effect of IL-4 and suppressed the DC and MGC formation induced by GM-CSF + IL-4 and M-CSF + IL-4 , respectively .
Taken together , these results provide a new aspect to our knowledge of monocyte differentiation and provide evidence that human monocytes are flexible in their differentiation potential and are precursors not only of macrophages but also of CD1+relB+DC and TRAP-positive MGC .
Such a diverse pathway of monocyte differentiation may constitute one of the basic mechanisms of immune regulation .
The gene encoding the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -specific dUTPase was amplified from virus DNA by PCR .
The active enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and in insect cells as a non-fusion protein .
The protein from E. coli specifically converted dUTP to dUMP and did not react with other dNTPs or NTPs .
Preliminary experiments yielded a Km value of about 0.8 microM for dUTP .
MAbs against the dUTPase reacted with a protein of approximately 31 kDa in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -stimulated B cells harbouring either type 1 or type 2 EBV .
The protein was found in untreated cells at low levels , whereas induction of the lytic replication cycle by TPA treatment or by providing the immediate early transactivator BZLF1 in trans resulted in increased expression .
We demonstrated that the virus dUTPase isolated from EBV-infected cells is a phosphoprotein .
The protein expressed in insect cells was used to test for the presence of specific antibodies in sera from normal , healthy carriers and from patients with various diseases .
While the sera of EBV-negative individuals ( 0/3 ) or healthy carriers ( 0/33 ) did not contain detectable levels of antibodies , patients with mononucleosis ( 5/18 ) , chronic EBV infection ( 2/7 ) , EBV reactivation ( 7/20 ) and human immunodeficiency virus infection ( 5/24 ) showed elevated antibody titres against the enzyme .
This indicated that the dUTPase is expressed during EBV replication and reactivation .
The enzyme might therefore be a potential target for drug therapy under conditions of active DNA replication .
Prostaglandins of the E series are immunomodulatory agents which exert inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on a variety of immune responses .
Since it is known that PGE2 is able to increase cAMP levels , we investigated whether it can affect gene expression through the activation of the transcription factors which bind enhancer elements in the promoter regions of cAMP-regulated genes .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , we demonstrated that a short treatment of human T lymphocytes with PGE2 induces specific binding activity to CRE and AP-2 , but not AP-1 , DNA elements .
Since the okadaic acid , a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor , prolongs the induction of the binding activity , phosphorylation events are likely to occur .
This activity seems to be due to increased cAMP levels because forskolin and IBMX mimic the effects of PGE2 .
More interestingly , transfection experiments with CRE-CAT plasmide show that PGE2 activates the transcription of a CRE-containing promoter .
These data support the positive role for PGE2 on some immune functions .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) is produced by natural killer cells and certain subsets of T cells , but the basis for its selective expression is unknown .
Within the region between -108 and -40 base pairs of the IFN-gamma promoter are two conserved and essential regulatory elements , which confer activation-specific expression in T cells .
This report describes studies indicating that the most proximal of these two regulatory elements is an important determinant of its restricted expression .
The proximal element is a composite site that binds members of the CREB/ATF , AP-1 , and octamer families of transcription factors .
Jun is essential for activation-induced transcription and binds preferably as a heterodimer with ATF-2 .
In contrast , CREB appears to dampen transcription from this element .
The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do not express IFN-gamma , and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding .
As a target for DNA methylation and for binding of transcription factors that mediate or impede transcription , this element appears to play a central role in controlling IFN-gamma expression .
The interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( IL-2R alpha ) gene is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation .
IL-2R alpha is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli .
Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) stimulates IL-2R alpha transcription , thereby amplifying expression of its own high-affinity receptor .
IL-2R alpha transcription is at least in part controlled by two positive regulatory regions , PRRI and PRRII .
PRRI is an inducible proximal enhancer , located between nucleotides -276 and -244 , which contains NF-kappaB and SRE/CArG motifs .
PRRII is a T-cell-specific enhancer , located between nucleotides -137 and -64 , which binds the T-cell-specific Ets protein Elf-1 and HMG-I(Y) proteins .
However , none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL-2R alpha transcription by IL-2 .
To find new regulatory regions of the IL-2R alpha gene , 8.5 kb of the 5' end noncoding sequence of the IL-2R alpha gene have been sequenced .
We identified an 86-nucleotide fragment that is 90 % identical to the recently characterized murine IL-2-responsive element ( mIL-2rE ) .
This putative human IL-2rE , designated PRRIII , confers IL-2 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .
PRRIII contains a Stat protein binding site that overlaps with an EBS motif ( GASd/EBSd ) .
These are essential for IL-2 inducibility of PRRIII/CAT reporter constructs .
IL-2 induced the binding of Stat5a and b proteins to the human GASd element .
To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings , we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of IL-2R alpha expression correlated with occupancy of the GASd element .
Our data demonstrate a major role of the GASd/EBSd element in IL-2R alpha regulation and suggest that the T-cell-specific Elf-1 factor can serve as a transcriptional repressor .
The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein LMP1 appears to be a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) on the basis of an intrinsic ability to aggregate in the plasma membrane and an association of its cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus ( CT ) with TNFR-associated factors ( TRAFs ) .
We now show that in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes most of TRAF1 or TRAF3 and 5 % of TRAF2 are associated with LMP1 and that most of LMP1 is associated with TRAF1 or TRAF3 .
TRAF1 , TRAF2 , and TRAF3 bind to a single site in the LMP1 CT corresponding to amino acids ( aa ) 199 to 214 , within a domain which is important for B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( aa 187 to 231 ) .
Further deletional and alanine mutagenesis analyses and comparison with TRAF binding sequences in CD40 , in CD30 , and in the LMP1 of other lymphycryptoviruses provide the first evidence that PXQXT/S is a core TRAF binding motif .
The negative effects of point mutations in the LMP1(1-231) core TRAF binding motif on TRAF binding and NF-kappaB activation genetically link the TRAFs to LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation .
NF-kappaB activation by LMP1(1-231) is likely to be mediated by TRAF1/TRAF2 heteroaggregates since TRAF1 is unique among the TRAFs in coactivating NF-kappaB with LMP1(1-231) , a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant can block LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation as well as TRAF1 coactivation , and 30 % of TRAF2 is associated with TRAF1 in EBV-transformed B cells .
TRAF3 is a negative modulator of LMP1(1-231)-mediated NF-kappaB activation .
Surprisingly , TRAF1 , -2 , or -3 does not interact with the terminal LMP1 CT aa 333 to 386 which can independently mediate NF-kappaB activation .
The constitutive association of TRAFs with LMP1 through the aa 187 to 231 domain which is important in NF-kappaB activation and primary B-lymphocyte growth transformation implicates TRAF aggregation in LMP1 signaling .
Neutral sphingomyelinase ( SMase ) can be activated by extracellular signals to produce ceramide , which may affect mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activities .
Neutral SMase activity was assessed in membranes from Jurkat , a human T-cell line , and EL4 , a murine T-cell line .
Ara-C activated SMase with 10 minutes in both Jurkat and EL4 cells , while phorbol ester ( PMA ) had no effect .
PMA , but not Ara-C or ceramides , activated ERK MAPKS , in Jurkat and EL4 .
PMA acted synergistically with ionomycin to activate JNK MAPKs in Jurkat and EL4 within 10 minutes .
Ara-C activated JNKs only after prolonged incubation ( 90-120 minutes ) .
Thus , ceramide is not a positive signal for ERK activation in T-cell lines .
The effects of Ara-C on JNK activity may be mediated through secondary response pathways .
In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr-1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of B cell lines , including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines .
Egr-1 expression correlates with the cellular phenotype and the specific pattern of viral latency established within the individual cell lines .
Thus , constitutive activation of Egr-1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all group III EBV genome carrying cell lines .
In contrast , Egr-1 expression is abrogated in group I Burkitt tumor cells , irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status .
Activated viral gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr-1 gene expression .
Several forms of EGR-1 protein are found within the different groups of cell lines , and the binding activity to DNA consensus sequences was investigated .
Finally , time course analysis of Egr-1 expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that Egr-1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte .
Signals transduced via the TCR activate the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which , in turn , is critical to the transcriptional induction of many genes important for the proliferation and expression of a differentiated phenotype .
Treatment of T cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA in combination with Ca2+ ionophores mimics this process , and the two agents are often substituted for TCR stimulation , bypassing the TCR .
Here we identify intracellular signaling components involved in activation of NF-kappaB following TCR stimulation .
TCR signaling was triggered by treating Jurkat T cells with PHA or anti-CD3 Abs , and NF-kappaB activation was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and/or by kappaB-dependent reporter assays .
Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB , high doses of staurosporine did not interfere with activation of NF-kappaB by PHA , while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA .
PHA-induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity was , however , effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of Raf-1 , suggesting a critical role for a Raf kinase .
The TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB was also dependent on a Ca2+ influx , because the Ca2+ channel blocker , SK&F 96365 , as well as other agents that prevented the Ca2+ influx , inhibited NF-kappaB activation .
Cotransfection of a constitutively active form of calcineurin largely substituted for the Ca2+ requirement and reversed the blockade by SK&F 96365 .
Consistent with these observations , coexpression of constitutively active forms of Raf-1 and calcineurin synergistically induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity , suggesting a physiologically relevant functional interaction between the kinase and the phosphatase .
A factor in bovine colostrum ( colostrum inhibitory factor , CIF ) inhibits interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) production in activated T helper cells by blocking the accumulation of IL2 mRNA .
To determine whether CIF blocks at the level of IL2 transcription , we introduced reporter plasmids into the human T leukemia cell line Jurkat by transient transfection .
These contained the luciferase gene under the control of either the human IL2 upstream enhancer region ( segments -326 to +45 ) or three repeats of the NFAT element contained within it ( segments -255 to -285 ) .
Expression of luciferase in these cells was induced by phorbol myristate acetate plus a calcium ionophore .
CIF inhibited induction of either construct as did cyclosporine , which is known to block activation of the NFAT element .
CIF failed to inhibit several other enhancer elements .
The NFAT-controlled luciferase gene system distinguishes CIF from other T cell inhibitory activities present in colostrum , in particular , TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 and the glucocorticoids .
Stably transfected Jurkat cells behaved similarly to the transiently transfected ones with respect to inhibition by CIF and cyclosporine .
The NFAT-luc assay is a useful technique for the rapid , sensitive measurement of CIF or other immunosuppressants with a similar mode of action .
The chemokine RANTES has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases including asthma and rhinitis which are frequently treated with glucocorticoids .
We observed that dexamethasone dramatically inhibited RANTES mRNA expression dose dependently in anti-CD3 activated Hut-78 T cells and human PBMCs .
Inhibition of RANTES expression did not appear to be secondary to IL-2 inhibition and required binding to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor .
The down-regulation of RANTES expression by glucocorticoids in T cells may directly contribute to the efficacy of these agents in suppressing cellular infiltration and to their anti-inflammatory properties .
BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids are important medications used to control the airway inflammation associated with asthma .
Synthetic glucocorticoids vary in their binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) .
METHODS : We compared hydrocortisone , beclomethasone dipropionate , triamcinolone acetonide , flunisolide , and budesonide with regard to their capacity to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation from six patients with steroid-sensitive asthma and seven patients with steroid-resistant asthma .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell GCR binding affinities for dexamethasone and budesonide were also determined for both patient groups by using a radioligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis .
RESULTS : Dose-dependent inhibition was demonstrated for all glucocorticoids in both patient groups , with the steroid-resistant group requiring approximately 2 log-fold more glucocorticoids for an equivalent degree of inhibition .
The mean concentrations necessary to cause 50 % inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50s ) for the steroid-sensitive group ranged from 2 x 10(-10) mol/L for budesonide to 7 x 10(-8) mol/L for hydrocortisone , whereas the mean IC50s for the steroid-resistant group ranged from approximately 2 x 10(-8) mol/L for budesonide to greater than 10(-6) mol/L for hydrocortisone .
In addition , a significant correlation was noted between the degree of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50 ) and the binding affinity of dexamethasone to the GCR .
Patients with steroid-resistant asthma have been shown to have a reduced GCR binding affinity .
The GCR binding affinity for budesonide was significantly higher in both groups ( i.e. , lower dissociation constant ) than that obtained for dexamethasone .
CONCLUSION : These data suggest that glucocorticoids such as budesonide , by virtue of their high GCR binding affinities and greater ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation , may therefore be beneficial in the management of difficult-to-control asthma .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a transcription factor that binds to the consensus DNA sequence in the cis-acting elements of various genes .
Although NF-kappa B activates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , little is known about the role of NF-kappa B activation in the induction of IgE synthesis in human B cells .
Therefore we first examined the participation of NF-kappa B in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 .
Stimulation of DND39 cells with IL-4 or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and subsequently induced nuclear expression of NF-kappa B , which was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
n-Acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , blocked NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4 and by anti-CD40 mAb .
Although inhibition of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription by NAC was not sufficient , the agent remarkably diminished anti-CD40 mAb-mediated up-regulation of germline C epsilon transcription .
Second , we studied the effect of NAC on IgE synthesis in human normal B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb .
NAC was effective in inhibiting mature C epsilon transcription and IgE synthesis in the T cell-independent culture system .
However , NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of IgE by atopic B cells .
These results indicate that NF-kappa B activity is commonly inducible in DND39 cells by IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating IgE synthesis in B cells .
Aging is classically accompanied by a dysregulation of the immunologic machinery .
As a consequence , the immune response developed in senescent organisms is usually inappropriate , often inefficient , sometimes aberrant , and potentially detrimental .
The age-associated immune dysfunction may be implicated to some degree in the extreme susceptibility of the elderly to infection and neoplasia and may even participate in various aspects of senescence .
The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence is still fragmentary .
The most extensively studied phenomenon is the progressive decline in the proliferative capacities of T lymphocytes with aging .
The loss of proliferative potential in response to antigenic challenge is a characteristic feature of immune senescence .
It is directly implicated in the emergence of the age-related immune deficiency .
The purpose of this review is to show how the accumulation of various biochemical lesions with advancing age leads to the failure of a critical cell function , namely the activation-induced lymphocyte proliferation .
The biochemical modifications responsible for the defect in transduction and execution of the proliferative signal are analyzed as a function of age .
The multiple alterations observed on the various biochemical pathways may appear as a consequence of a unique deleterious mechanism more fundamentally related to the process of senescence such as the inability to cope with oxidative stress .
We previously reported that monocyte adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -treated endothelial cells increased expression of tissue factor and CD36 on monocytes .
Using immunological cross-linking to mimic receptor engagement by natural ligands , we now show that CD15 ( Lewis X ) , a monocyte counter-receptor for endothelial selectins may participate in this response .
We used cytokine production as a readout for monocyte activation and found that CD15 cross-linking induced TNF-alpha release from peripheral blood monocytes and cells from the monocytic cell line MM6 .
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed an increase in steady-state TNF-alpha mRNA after 3 to 4 hours of cross-linking .
CD15 cross-linking also concomitantly increased interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) mRNA , while no apparent change was observed in the levels of beta-actin mRNA , indicating specificity .
To examine transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes by CD15 engagement , a CAT plasmid reporter construct containing IL-1 beta promoter/enhancer sequences was introduced into MM6 .
Subsequent cross-linking of CD15 increased CAT activity .
CD15 engagement by monoclonal antibody also attenuated IL-1 beta transcript degradation , demonstrating that signaling via CD15 also had posttranscriptional effects .
Nuclear extracts of anti-CD15 cross-linked cells demonstrated enhanced levels of the transcriptional factor activator protein-1 , minimally changed nuclear factor-kappa B , and did not affect SV40 promoter specific protein-1 .
We conclude that engagement of CD15 on monocytes results in monocyte activation .
In addition to its well-recognized adhesive role , CD15 may function as an important signaling molecule capable of initiating proinflammatory events in monocytes that come into contact with activated endothelium .
The caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is activated by gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) in promonocytic cells .
We have previously shown that a 70-bp element is necessary and sufficient for the response of the CAEV LTR to this cytokine .
At the 5' end , this 70-bp IFN-gamma response element contains sequence similarity to the gamma activated site ( GAS ) .
Here we demonstrate that the putative GAS element in the CAEV LTR binds specifically to a cellular factor induced by IFN-gamma in promonocytic cells .
Substitution mutations in this consensus sequence eliminate binding of the inducible factor .
The GAS element from the 70-bp motif is sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN-gamma using a heterologous minimal promoter .
Consistent with the binding data , the same mutations in the GAS element eliminate responsiveness to IFN-gamma in the context of both a functional CAEV LTR and a heterologous promoter .
The cellular factor that binds to the GAS element is present from 5 min to 14 h after stimulation with IFN-gamma .
Binding of the nuclear factor to the GAS element in the CAEV LTR is inhibited by antibody directed against STAT1 ( p91/84 ) .
Thus , the GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR is essential for the response to IFN-gamma and a STAT1-like factor binds to this site .
The STAT-1 signaling pathway provides at least one mechanism for activation of the CAEV LTR by IFN-gamma in monocytes .
These data are the first demonstration of a role for a STAT family member in the regulation of a viral promoter .
T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins , including Cbl , a protooncogene product whose function remains unclear .
As a first step toward elucidating the function of Cbl in TCR-initiated signaling , we evaluated the ability of wild-type Cbl or a transforming Cbl mutant ( 70Z/3 ) to induce transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) element derived from the interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) promoter in transiently cotransfected Jurkat-TAg T cells .
70Z/3 , but not Cbl , caused NFAT activation which was significantly enhanced by stimulation with calcium ionophore , and was drastically reduced by cyclosporin A pretreatment .
A point mutation of a potential phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) binding site ( Y731EAM to Y731EAC ) in 70Z/3 disrupted the association of PI3-K with 70Z/3 , but did not reduce the induction of NFAT activity , suggesting that the interaction between Cbl and PI3-K is not required in the 70Z/3-mediated induction of NFAT .
Additional mapping studies indicated that defined deletions of C-terminal 70Z/3 sequences affected to a variable degree its ability to stimulate NFAT activity .
Strikingly , deletion of 346 C-terminal residues augmented this activity , whereas removal of 20 additional residues abolished it .
Coexpression of dominant negative Ras abrogated the basal or ionomycin-stimulated , 70Z/3-mediated NFAT activation , suggesting a functional Ras is required for this activation .
These results implicate Cbl in Ras-dependent signaling pathways which lead to NFAT activation .
During monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation , the cellular content of vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) increases more than 4-fold .
We have shown previously that amplified expression of the B2 subunit of the V-ATPase occurs solely by increased transcription , and that the 5'-untranslated region of the B2 gene , containing multiple consensus binding sites for the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 , is required for this expression .
The present study demonstrates that AP-2 binding sequences are essential for increased transcription from the B2 promoter during monocyte-macrophage differentiation and that AP-2 , expressed exogenously in THP-1 and other cells , activates transcription from the B2 promoter .
In mobility shift assays , a nuclear factor from THP-1 and U-937 cells was identified that binds to several AP-2 response elements within the B2 promoter , but does not react with AP-2 antibodies , and has a DNA sequence binding affinity profile that differs from AP-2 .
These findings suggest that a novel AP-2-like transcription factor is responsible for V-ATPase B subunit amplification during monocyte differentiation .
There is general agreement on the inflammatory pathogenesis of bronchial asthma : an accumulation of activated eosinophils , degranulated mast cells , T lymphocytes and in very severe forms , granulocytes has constantly been found in the bronchial mucosa .
In allergic bronchial asthma , inflammation seems to be orchestrated predominantly by a subset of T lymphocytes , with a phenotype similar to the Th2 subset able to produce IL-4 and IL-5 .
Although corticosteroids are the most potent therapeutic agents used for this disease , their anti-inflammatory effect differs from patient to patient .
Some criteria which can be used to define steroid-resistant bronchial asthma are listed here .
This review analyzes various molecular alterations responsible for the deficient response to corticosteroid treatment observed in steroid-resistant bronchial asthmatic subjects .
New knowledge on the mechanism of steroid resistance may have important implications for the treatment of chronic asthma and other diseases .
The tax gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) transactivates interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene through activation of an enhancer termed CD28 responsive element ( CD28RE ) .
Tax activation of the CD28RE is partially mediated by a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells , NF-AT1 .
We have previously shown that NF-AT1 is constitutively active in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the Tax cDNA , although the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of this finding remain unclear .
In this report , we demonstrate that the active form of NF-AT1 is also present in the nuclei of HTLV-I-transformed T cells that express the Tax protein .
Interestingly , the constitutive activation of NF-AT1 in these T cells is associated with its dephosphorylation .
Furthermore , the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with cyclosporin A , an immunosuppressant inhibiting the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin .
These results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-transformed T cells results from its dephosphorylation , which in turn may be due to deregulation of calcineurin .
We have set out to test a model for tissue-specific gene expression that relies on the early replication of expressed genes to sequester limiting activating transcription factors .
Using an erythroid cell line , we have tested the changes in the DNA binding activity of the lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 through the cell cycle .
We find that GATA-1 activity is low in G1 , peaks in mid-S phase , and then decreases in G2/M .
In contrast , the binding activities of two ubiquitous transcription factors , Oct1 and Sp1 , remain high in G2/M .
GATA-1 protein and mRNA vary in a similar manner through the cell cycle , suggesting that the expression of the gene or the stability of its message is regulated .
Although a number of transcription factors involved in the control of the cell cycle or DNA replication have been shown to peak in S phase , this is the first example of a lineage-restricted transcription factor displaying S phase-specific DNA binding activity .
One interpretation of these data leads to a model in which the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding amplifies the effect of early replication on the activation of erythroid-specific genes at the same time as preventing activation of non-erythroid genes containing GATA-responsive elements .
These results may also relate to recent data implicating GATA-1 function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression .
A novel B-cell derived ( Bcd ) oncogene has been isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of one B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) patient using DNA transfer and a mouse tumorigenicity assay .
The Bcd proto-oncogene was activated by a truncation in the 5' UTR .
It predicts for two open reading frames ( ORFs ) .
ORF1 consists of 240 bp that would encode 80 amino acids , while the major ORF2 consists of 648 bp capable of coding for 216 amino acids .
Predicted peptide sequence of ORF2 contained a zinc finger domain which showed significant homology to GC box binding proteins BTEB2 and SP1 .
Transfection of an expression vector containing ORF2 but not full length cDNA was able to transform NIH3T3 cells and induce tumors in nude mice .
Bcd mRNA transcripts of < or = 2.6 kb were selectively expressed in PBL and testis of healthy individuals .
Within the PBL , Bcd gene expression was restricted to CD19+ B-cells and absent from CD14+ monocytes and T-cells .
Bcd transcripts were detected in all normal PBL samples tested but not in several malignant human B-cell lines and not in 50 % of B-cells from B-CLL patients .
However , stimulation of B-cells from B-CLL patients under conditions which induced differentiation into plasma cells was associated with induction of Bcd gene expression .
The Bcd gene may therefore play an important role in B-cell growth and development .
The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) is essential for the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens .
The tissular patterns of CIITA and MHC class II gene expression are tightly correlated : CIITA mRNA is highly expressed in B cells , and is induced by interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in macrophage and epithelial cell lines .
We first isolated two overlapping cosmids encoding human CIITA which , when co-transfected , are able to restore MHC class II expression in a B-lymphoblastoid cell line ( B-LCL ) defective for CIITA .
Subsequently , a 1.8 kilobase ( kb ) fragment of the CIITA promoter was isolated and sequenced .
A motif presenting a strong similarity to an initiator was detected , as well as putative binding sites for Sp1 , GATA-2 , LyF-1 , ets-1 , AP1 , and MZF1 transcription factors , and two GAS motifs .
When introduced in front of a luciferase reporter gene , this promoter is able to direct a high luciferase activity in a human B-LCL .
In contrast , luciferase expression was not stimulated after IFN-gamma treatment when the construct was transfected in macrophage or in epithelial cell lines .
However , an induction of the human CIITA gene was observed in mouse macrophage and fibrosarcoma cell lines , when the cells were transfected with a cosmid containing the human CIITA gene , but lacking the 1.8 kb promoter described above .
Taken together , these data suggest the existence of an intragenic promoter driving an IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CIITA .
The nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is thought to be crucially involved in the gene activation of several cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) .
Previously , we showed that fibroblast conditioned medium ( FCM ) is able to inhibit both TNF mRNA accumulation and protein release in peripheral blood-derived human monocytes ( PBM ) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
In this study we have investigated the effect of FCM on the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB , by means of electrophoretic shift assay ( EMSA ) .
We provide evidence that FCM strongly inhibits the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in PBM .
Furthermore , we show that exogenous PGE2 mimics the NF-kappaB inhibitory effect of FCM .
On the other hand , FCM produced in the presence of indomethacin does not inhibit NF-kappaB activation by LPS .
Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that inflammatory and immune responses of monocytes/macrophages may be modulated at the molecular level by signals originating from tissue structural cells such as fibroblasts .
Prolonged poor glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients often leads to a decline in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells , accompanied by a decrease in the insulin content of the cells .
As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to pancreatic beta cells , we induced glycation in HIT-T15 cells using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity , D-ribose , and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription .
The results of reporter gene analyses revealed that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control beta-actin gene promoter ; approximately 50 and 80 % of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , respectively .
In agreement with this , decrease in the insulin mRNA and insulin content was observed in the glycation-induced cells .
Also , gel mobility shift analyses using specific antiserum revealed decrease in the DNA-binding activity of an insulin gene transcription factor , PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 .
These effects of D-ribose seemed almost irreversible but could be prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM N-acetylcysteine , thus suggesting that glycation and reactive oxygen species , generated through the glycation reaction , serve as mediators of the phenomena .
These observations suggest that protein glycation in pancreatic beta cells , which occurs in vivo under chronic hyperglycemia , suppresses insulin gene transcription and thus can explain part of the beta cell glucose toxicity .
Several studies have pointed to a link between immune and endocrine systems , including a regulatory function of GH on monocyte activation .
The present study demonstrates that human THP-1 promonocytic cells , engineered by gene transfer to constitutively produce human growth hormone ( hGH ) , secreted depressed amounts of TNF-alpha in response to challenge by LPS .
The effect of GH appears to occur in an autocrine fashion , since the inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion by constitutive GH production could be abolished in the presence of anti-hGH mAb .
The GH-induced inhibitory effect was also observed using normal human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages .
Inhibition of TNF-alpha production by THP-1-hGH-transfected cells cultured in the presence of LPS is dependent on a selective pathway , since no inhibition of TNF-alpha production was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of PMA .
Inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion by LPS-stimulated THP-1-hGH cells was associated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB .
The capacity of GH to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by monocytes without altering other pathways leading to TNF-alpha production may be of potential relevance in septic shock , since GH is available for clinical use .
Activation of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor ( G-CSFR ) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular substrates in proliferating cells and nonproliferating , terminally differentiated neutrophils .
The kinases that couple ligand binding to tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates by the G-CSFR with activation of specific functional programs are largely unknown .
In this study , we examined early signaling events in proliferating and terminally differentiated cells following G-CSF stimulation to determine whether identical signaling cascades are activated .
In murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with the human G-CSFR and NFS-60 cells constitutively expressing the murine G-CSFR , G-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Tyk2 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and , to a lesser extent , Stat1 was also detected following G-CSF stimulation .
Using a mitogenically incompetent human G-CSFR mutant in which Pro639 and Pro641 were substituted by alanine , the box 1 PDP motif was found to be required for activation of Jak kinases , tyrosine phosphorylation of the G-CSFR , and recruitment of Stat proteins .
Notably , no activation of Jak1 , Jak2 , Tyk2 , Stat1 , or Stat3 was observed in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation .
In addition , there was no detectable activation in neutrophils of the recently cloned Jak3 kinase , which has been reported to be expressed at high levels as myeloid cells undergo terminal neutrophilic maturation .
These results indicate a lack of involvement of Jak kinases in signaling by the G-CSFR in neutrophils , and suggest utilization of alternative signal transduction pathways distinct from those in proliferating cells .
Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway correlates with proliferative signaling by the G-CSFR and requires the membrane-proximal box 1 PXP motif , which is conserved in members of the cytokine receptor superfamily .
The negative regulatory element ( NRE ) of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) core promoter contains three subregions which act synergistically to suppress core promoter activity .
One of these subregions , NRE gamma , is active in both HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells and was found to be bound by a protein factor present in both cell types .
Here we show that the transcription factor RFX1 can bind to NRE gamma and transactivate the core promoter through this site .
Mutations which abrogated the gene-suppressive activity of NRE gamma prevented RFX1 from binding to NRE gamma .
In addition , RFX1 can bind simultaneously , most likely as a heterodimer , with the transcription factor MIBP1 to NRE gamma .
In the absence of a cloned MIBP1 gene for further studies , we hypothesize that RFX1 acts with MIBP1 to negatively regulate the core promoter activity through the NRE gamma site .
The ability of RFX1 to transactivate the core promoter raises the possibility that RFX1 may play a dual role in regulating HBV gene expression .
Monoclonal anti-D antibodies submitted to the Third Monoclonal International Workshop were evaluated against a number of D variant cells using standard serological techniques .
The monoclonal antibodies were able to discriminate between the cells of Categories Va , VI and DFR but not Category III cells .
Cells within each category did not give any aberrant results .
The Rh : 33 cells behaved as normal Rh ( D ) positive cells .
Carboxylesterases play an important role in defense and clearance mechanisms of the monocyte/macrophage system .
During the differentiation process of cells from the monocytic cell line THP-1 we observed a transient transcriptional upregulation of a human carboxylesterase analyzed by means of Northern blots .
In PMA-treated THP-1 cells we could detect three major transcription initiation sites as revealed by Nuclease Protection Assay carried out with two overlapping antisense RNA probes .
We have recently cloned the carboxylesterase upstream sequence and showed its basal promoter activity in CHO cells .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we demonstrated that the promoter region spanning base pairs -1 to -275 , which contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors , is bound by nuclear factors Sp1 and IRBP but not by C/EBPs .
Taken together these data indicate that carboxylesterase gene transcription in THP-1 cells starts at multiple initiation sites and that Sp1 and IRBP may be critical factors for modulating the differentiation-dependent transcription of this human carboxylesterase gene .
Tepoxalin , a dual enzyme inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase has been shown to inhibit T-cell activation .
Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin , but not cyclosporin , suppresses NF-kappa B activation .
Here we report that tepoxalin selectively inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) /MAC-1 ( CD11b/CD18 ) dependent adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to IL-1 activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells .
The mechanism of inhibition is related to the surface expression of several cell adhesion molecules .
Flow cytometry analyses on cultured cells that were treated with tepoxalin or antisense oligonucleotides to the P65/p50 subunit of NF-kappa B , and then stimulated with PMA , revealed a reduced expression of CD11b/CD18 on monocytic HL60 cells , and endothelial adhesion molecule-1 ( CD62E ) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( CD106 ) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells .
Expression of other adhesion molecules such as lymphocyte function associated-antigen-1 ( CD11a/CD18 ) and CD54 were unaffected .
Tepoxalin also inhibited the secretion of a NF-kappa B regulated chemokine , IL-8 , a known inducer of CD11b/CD18 expression .
Thus the suppression of CD11b/CD18 expression by tepoxalin may involve IL-8 .
Our results suggest that by inhibiting NF-kappa B activation , surface expression of several adhesion molecules can be modulated and that tepoxalin may be useful in treating selected adhesion mediated events such as leukocyte migration or atherosclerotic plaque formation .
Rap1 is a small , Ras-like GTPase whose function and regulation are still largely unknown .
We have developed a novel assay to monitor the active , GTP-bound form of Rap1 based on the differential affinity of Rap1GTP and Rap1GDP for the Rap binding domain of RalGDS ( RBD ) .
Stimulation of blood platelets with alpha-thrombin or other platelet activators caused a rapid and strong induction of Rap1 that associated with RBD in vitro .
Binding to RBD increased from undetectable levels in resting platelets to > 50 % of total Rap1 within 30 s after stimulation .
An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is both necessary and sufficient for Rap1 activation since it was induced by agents that increase intracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by a Ca2+-chelating agent .
Neither inhibition of translocation of Rap1 to the cytoskeleton nor inhibition of platelet aggregation affected thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 .
In contrast , prostaglandin I2 ( PGI2 ) , a strong negative regulator of platelet function , inhibited agonist-induced as well as Ca2+-induced activation of Rap1 .
From our results , we conclude that Rap1 activation in platelets is an important common event in early agonist-induced signalling , and that this activation is mediated by an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration .
Currently available data indicate that erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other , and there may exist progenitor cells common to those two lineages may exist .
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML-M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .
These blast cells express lineage-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid-specific mRNAs such as gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS-E ) , indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .
These results suggest that blasts in M7 and TMD may correspond to progenitors of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel of transcription factors which are involved in the gene control of lymphoid cells .
The following transcription factors were studied : the Octamer factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 , members of the AP-1 factor family , NF-AT factors , in particular NF-ATp , and members of the Rel/NF-kB family .
We show that the constitutive nuclear translocation of NF-ATp , a member of the growing family of NF-AT factors , is a hallmark of nonstimulated B cells from CLL patients that distinguishes B-CLL cells from ' normal ' B lymphocytes .
Constitutive nuclear appearance was also observed for NF-kB2/p52 .
Constitutive binding of further factor proteins to DNA , such as JunD , c-Fos and FosB , was detected in several patients whereas the localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as c-Jun , RelA/p65 and c-Rel was unaltered .
It is remarkable that in B-CLL cells the nuclear appearance and DNA binding of specific transcription factors is dramatically affected whereas other members of the same factor family remained unaltered in these leukemic cells .
It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific ' pre-activation ' , i.e. constitutive nuclear translocation and DNA binding , of these members of NF-AT , NF-kB and AP-1 factor families .
Tax1 , a potent activator of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcription , has been shown to modulate expression of many cellular genes .
Tax1 does not bind DNA directly but regulates transcription through protein-protein interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors .
Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins which interact with Tax1 , we isolated the B subunit of the CCAAT binding protein NF-Y from a HeLa cDNA library .
The interaction of Tax1 with NF-YB was specific in that NF-YB did not interact with a variety of other transcription factors , including human immunodeficiency virus Tat , human papillomavirus E6 , and Bicoid , or with the M7 ( amino acids 29CP-AS ) Tax1 mutant .
However , NF-YB did interact with the C-terminal Tax1 mutants M22 ( 130TL-AS ) and M47 ( 319LL-RS ) .
We also show that in vitro-translated NF-YB specifically bound to a glutathione S-transferase-Tax1 fusion protein .
Further , Tax1 coimmunoprecipitated with NF-Y from nuclear extracts of HTLV-1-transformed cells , providing evidence for in vivo interaction of Tax1 and NF-YB .
We further demonstrate that Tax1 specifically activated the NF-Y-responsive DQbeta promoter , as well as a minimal promoter which contains only the Y-box element .
In addition , mutation of the Y-box element alone abrogated Tax1-mediated activation .
Taken together , these data indicate that Tax1 interacts with NF-Y through the B subunit and that this interaction results in activation of the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter .
Through activation of this and other NF-Y driven promoters , the Tax1-NF-Y interaction may play a critical role in causing cellular transformation and HTLV-1 pathogenesis .
The ferritin H-chain gene promoter regulation was analyzed in heme-treated Friend leukemia cells ( FLCs ) and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation .
In the majority of cell lines studied , the regulation of ferritin expression was exerted mostly at the translational level .
However , in differentiating erythroid cells , which must incorporate high levels of iron to sustain hemoglobin synthesis , and in macrophages , which are involved in iron storage , transcriptional regulation seemed to be a relevant mechanism .
We show here that the minimum region of the ferritin H-gene promoter that is able to confer transcriptional regulation by heme in FLCs to a reporter gene is 77 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box .
This cis element binds a protein complex referred to as HRF ( heme-responsive factor ) , which is greatly enhanced both in heme-treated FLCs and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation .
The CCAAT element present in reverse orientation in this promoter region of the ferritin H-chain gene is necessary for binding and for gene activity , since a single point mutation is able to abolish the binding of HRF and the transcriptional activity in transfected cells .
By competition experiments and supershift assays , we identified the induced HRF as containing at least the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y .
NF-Y is formed by three subunits , A , B , and C , all of which are necessary for DNA binding .
Cotransfection with a transdominant negative mutant of the NF-YA subunit abolishes the transcriptional activation by heme , indicating that NF-Y plays an essential role in this activation .
We have also observed a differential expression of the NF-YA subunit in heme-treated and control FLCs and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation .
Numerous genes required during the immune or inflammation response as well as the adhesion process are regulated by nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) .
Associated with its inhibitor , I kappaB , NF-kappaB resides as an inactive form in the cytoplasm .
Upon stimulation by various agents , I kappaB is proteolyzed and NF-kappaB translocates to the nucleus , where it activates its target genes .
The transduction pathways that lead to I kappaB inactivation remain poorly understood .
In this study , we have characterized a cellular mutant , the 70/Z3-derived 1.3E2 murine pre-B cell line , that does not activate NF-kappaB in response to several stimuli .
We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide , Taxol , phorbol myristate acetate , interleukin-1 , or double-stranded RNA , I kappaB alpha is not degraded , as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 .
Neither a mutation in I kappaB alpha nor a mutation in p50 or relA , the two major subunits of NF-kappaB in this cell line , accounts for this phosphorylation defect .
As well as culminating in the inducible phosphorylation of I kappaB alpha on serines 32 and 36 , all the stimuli that are inactive on 1.3E2 cells exhibit a sensitivity to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) .
In contrast , stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock or phosphatase inhibitors , which use PDTC-insensitive pathways , induce I kappaB alpha degradation in 1.3E2 .
Analysis of the redox status of 1.3E2 does not reveal any difference from wild-type 70Z/3 .
We also report that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -derived Tax trans-activator induces NF-kappaB activity in 1.3E2 , suggesting that this viral protein does not operate via the defective pathway .
Finally , we show that two other I kappaB molecules , I kappaB beta and the recently identified I kappaB epsilon , are not degraded in the 1.3E2 cell line following stimulation .
Our results demonstrate that 1.3E2 is a cellular transduction mutant exhibiting a defect in a step that is required by several different stimuli to activate NF-kappaB .
In addition , this analysis suggests a common step in the signaling pathways that trigger I kappaB alpha , I kappaB beta , and I kappaB epsilon degradation .
Transcriptional factors of the NFAT family play an important role in regulating the expression of several cytokine genes during the immune response , such as the genes for interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 , among others .
Upon antigen stimulation , precursor CD4+ T helper ( pTh ) cells proliferate and differentiate into two populations of effector cells ( eTh1 and eTh2 ) , each one expressing a specific pattern of cytokines that distinguishes them from their precursors .
eTh2 cells are the major source of IL-4 , while gamma interferon is produced by eTh1 cells .
Here we have used reporter transgenic mice to show that DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFAT are transiently induced during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh1 or eTh2 cells to mediate the expression of IL-2 as a common growth factor in both pathways .
However , although NFAT DNA binding is similarly induced in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells upon antigen stimulation , only the NFAT complexes present in eTh2 cells are able to mediate high-level transcription , and relatively little NFAT transcriptional activity was induced in eTh1 cells .
In contrast to activated pTh cells , neither eTh1 nor eTh2 cells produced significant IL-2 upon stimulation , but the high levels of NFAT transcriptional activities directly correlate with the IL-4 production induced in response to antigen stimulation in eTh2 cells .
These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the failure of eTh1 cells to produce IL-4 in response to an antigen is due , at least partially , to a failure to induce high-level transcription of the IL-4 gene by NFAT .
Regulation of NFAT could be therefore a critical element in the polarization to eTh1 or eTh2 .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates more efficiently in vitro in differentiated macrophages than in freshly isolated monocytes .
We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of NF-kappaB with monocyte differentiation .
We demonstrated that constitutive expression of NF-kappaB in primary human monocytes changed significantly with differentiation in vitro to monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) and differentiation in vivo to alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) .
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively expressed high levels of transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer which decreased with time in culture in favor of the transcriptionally active p50/p65 and p50/RelB heterodimers .
As in MDMs , AMs constitutively expressed p50/p65 and p50/RelB although at lower levels .
HIV infection of fresh monocytes failed to induce p50/p65 as seen in MDMs .
The replacement of p50 homodimers with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection during in vitro culture .
The change in NF-kappaB components with monocyte differentiation in vivo may also explain the different transcriptional activities of these cell populations in HIV-infected individuals .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as hydrogen peroxide serve as second messengers in the induction of the transcription factor NF-kappaB , and hence in the activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in human cells .
During inflammatory reactions , many oxidative species are produced , one of which is hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , which is responsible for the microbicidal effects of activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes .
Treatment of a T-lymphocytic cell line with micromolar concentrations of HOCl promoted the appearance of transcription factor NF-kappaB ( the heterodimer p50/p65 ) in the nucleus of the cells , even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis .
Western blot analysis of the NF-kappaB inhibitory subunits ( IkappaB ) demonstrated that both IkappaB-alpha proteolysis and p105 processing were induced by the treatment .
NF-kappaB activation was very effective when cells were subjected to hyperthermia before being treated with HOCl .
Various antioxidants , such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , p-bromophenacyl-bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid could strongly reduce NF-kappaB translocation , demonstrating the importance of oxidative species in the transduction mechanism .
Moreover , ACH-2 cells treated with HOCl or H2O2 released tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in the supernatants .
The importance of TNF-alpha release in NF-kappaB induction by HOCl or H2O2 was demonstrated by the fact that : ( 1 ) the nuclear appearance of NF-kappaB was promoted in untreated cells ; and ( 2 ) synergism between TNF-alpha and HOCl was detected .
Collectively , these results suggest that HOCl should be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing NF-kappaB in a T-lymphocytic cell line through a transduction mechanism involving ROS , and having a long-distance effect through subsequent TNF-alpha release .
Heat-shock for 2 hours at 42 degrees C , or the administration for 3 hours of 100 or 150 microM cadmium chloride , inhibited the subsequent proliferation activity , induced the expression of functional differentiation markers , and caused an increase in the amount of the stress-responsive HSP70 protein in U-937 human promonocytic cells .
In addition , both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the intermediate filament protein vimentin , as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays .
By contrast , the amounts of actin and beta-tubulin were not significantly altered .
The amount of vimentin mRNA was also increased during recovery from stress , indicating that vimentin expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level .
Although cadmium caused an early , transient stimulation of c-jun and c-fos expression and AP-1 binding activity , heat-shock failed to alter both protooncogene expression and transcription factor binding , indicating that the stress-induced vimentin increase was not the result of AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation .
Finally , it was observed that the rate of decay of vimentin mRNA upon actinomycin D administration was decreased in heat- and cadmium-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells .
These results indicate that stress treatments cause an increase in vimentin levels in promonocytic cells , which may be explained at least in part by transcript stabilization .
Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is characterized by a chronic state of immune hyperactivation in patients .
Infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with HIV-1 in vitro resulted in increased interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) secretion in response to T cell activation via the CD3 and CD28 receptors .
Expression of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat recapitulated this phenotype and was associated with increased IL-2 secretion in response to costimulation with CD3 plus CD28 .
IL-2 superinduction by Tat occurred at the transcriptional level , was mediated by the CD28-responsive element in the IL-2 promoter , and was exclusively dependent on the 29 amino acids encoded by the second exon of Tat .
The Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , and Fes tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to interleukin ( IL ) -4 stimulation in different cell systems .
However , it is not clear which , if any , of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates in vivo .
In the present study , we have utilized a mutant Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line , E1C3 , and its parental Jak1-expressing counterpart , 1D4 , to analyze the role of Jak1 in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events .
IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) -1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells .
IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was pronounced in 1D4 cells , while no IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation was detected in E1C3 cells .
IL-4 also induced Stat6 DNA binding activity from lysates of 1D4 but not E1C3 cells utilizing a radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline epsilon promotor sequence ( Iepsilon ) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Reconstitution of Jak1 expression in E1C3 cells restored the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation .
These results provide evidence that Jak1 expression is required for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of crucial molecules involved in IL-4 signal transduction .
The possible clinical use of the methyl xanthine derivative , pentoxifylline ( PF ) , for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases is being noted with increasing interest .
In this paper , we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation .
We found that in T cells , anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF , whereas the induction of other NF-kappaB family members was not significantly affected .
However , induction of NF-AT , which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction , was not inhibited by PF .
Among genes that respond to these transcription factors , IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF , whereas IL-2R ( alpha ) chain mRNA induction was not affected .
These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL-2 promoter factor , for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments .
In contrast with the observation in T cells , c-Rel induction was not blocked by PF in B cells .
The greater selectivity of PF , compared with FK506 , at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo .
NF-kappa B is an important transcription factor required for T cell proliferation and other immunological functions .
The NF-kappa B1 gene encodes a 105-kD protein that is the precursor of the p50 component of NF-kappa B .
Previously , we and others have demonstrated that NF-kappa B regulates the NF-kappa B1 gene .
In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which T cell lines stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and phytohemagglutin ( PHA ) display significantly higher levels of NF-kappa B1 encoding transcripts than cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha , despite the fact that both stimuli activate NF-kappa B .
Characterization of the NF-kappa B1 promoter identified an Egr-1 site which was found to be essential for both the PMA/PHA-mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of NF-kappa B and Egr-1 .
Furthermore , Egr-1 induction was required for endogenous NF-kappa B1 gene expression , since PMA/PHA-stimulated T cell lines expressing antisense Egr-1 RNA were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-kappa B1 transcription .
Our studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both Egr-1 and NF-kappa B may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating NF-kappa B1 gene expression .
Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) is an important cytokine for B and T lymphocyte function and mediates its effects via a receptor that contains gammac .
B cells derived from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) are deficient in gammac and provide a useful model in which to dissect the role of this subunit in IL-4-mediated signaling .
We found that although IL-4 stimulation of X-SCID B cells did not result in Janus tyrosine kinase-3 ( JAK3 ) phosphorylation , other IL-4 substrates including JAK1 and IRS-1 were phosphorylated .
Additionally , we detected signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in X-SCID B cells with a wide range of gammac mutations .
However , reconstitution of these X-SCID B cells with gammac enhanced IL-4-mediated responses including STAT6 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity and resulted in increased CD23 expression .
Thus , gammac is not necessary to trigger IL-4-mediated responses in B cells , but its presence is important for optimal IL-4-signaling .
These results suggest that two distinct IL-4 signaling pathways exist .
AML1 may play a role in growth and differentiation of cells along erythroid and/or megakaryocytic lineages , because a significant level of the AML1 gene is expressed in these cells .
We overexpressed AML1a ( without the transcription-activating domain ) and AML1b ( with the domain ) proteins in K562 leukemia cells , which can be induced to differentiate into hemoglobin-producing cells and megakaryocytes .
The AML1a-transfected K562 cells had a reduced capacity to differentiate in the presence of sodium n-butyrate but not in the presence of other inducers , such as hemin , 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine , and herbimycin A .
The AML1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide but not the sense oligomer recovered its differentiation-inducing capacity in the presence of butyrate .
On the other hand , AML1b conferred a similar differentiation-inducing capacity upon K562 cells transfected with vector alone .
AML1a expression was associated with enhanced sensitivity to megakaryocytic differentiation induced by phorbol ester .
These results provide evidence that AML1 proteins play a role in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation .
We have compared the action on U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells of two DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors , namely the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide and the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193 .
One hour pulse-treatment with 3 microM etoposide caused topoisomerase associated , primary DNA breakage , which was rapidly followed by apoptosis .
By contrast , these effects were not observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 microM ICRF-193 .
However , continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide ( 0.15 microM ) and ICRF-193 ( 0.3 microM ) produced several similar effects , namely decreased cell proliferation , accumulation of cells at G2 , increase in cell mass , and induction of differentiation .
Under these conditions , etoposide produced a biphasic activation of protein kinase C , which consisted in an early transient activation ( from hours 1 to 6 ) of the membrane-bound enzyme followed by a later activation ( hour 48 ) of the total , membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme .
By contrast , ICRF-193 only provoked a late activation ( from hours 72 to 96 ) of the total enzyme .
When used at differentiation-inducing concentrations , both topoisomerase inhibitors caused a great stimulation of AP-1 binding activity , with maximum value at hour 12 in etoposide-treated cells and at hour 48 in ICRF-193-treated cells .
By contrast , the binding activity of the NF-kappa ( B ) and EGR-1 transcription factors was little affected .
It is concluded that topoisomerase II inhibitors may induce the differentiation of promonocytic cells , independently of their capacity to cause DNA strand breaks .
However , there are other effects , such as the early activation of protein kinase C , which are probably derived from the production of primary DNA breakage by some anti-topoisomerase drugs .
The regulatory Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for viral replication and also shows pleiotropic activities on various cell functions .
To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of Tat , we investigated the effect of endogenous and exogenous Tat protein on c-fos gene expression in T lymphoblastoid ( Jurkat ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines , as well as in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Transient cotransfection of tat cDNA in sense orientation ( tat/S ) , together with a plasmid containing the c-fos promoter ( FC3 , from - 711 to +42 ) in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene significantly enhanced CAT activity in Jurkat cells activated by the addition of 15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) or 5 micrograms/mL phytohemagglutinin plus 10(-7) mol/L phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and U937 cells activated by 15 % FCS or 10(-7) mol/L PMA .
This effect was specifically due to Tat , since Jurkat and U937 cells cotransfected either with tat cDNA in antisense orientation ( tat/AS ) , tat carrying a mutation in the aminoacid cys22-gly22 ( tat 22/S ) or with the backbone vector alone ( pRPneo-SL3 ) did not show any significant difference in c-fos promoter activity as compared to cells transfected with FC3 plasmid alone .
By using deletion mutants of the c-fos promoter , we found that the minimal DNA sequence required for Tat activity was located between nucleotides -404/-220 and that the serum responsive element ( SRE , -317/-288 ) , present within this region , was still responsive to Tat .
A single point mutation in the SRE completely abrogated the responsiveness to tat/S .
Exogenous recombinant Tat protein was also able to upregulate c-fos promoter activity in serum-activated Jurkat and U937 cells , as well as endogenous c-fos mRNA expression and c-Fos protein synthesis in both serum-activated cell lines and primary PBMC .
c-Fos protein was shown essential for an optimal transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) by Tat : incubation of Jurkat cells with antisense , but not sense , c-fos oligonucleotides significantly reduced either the Tat-enhanced expression of an LTR-CAT reporter construct or the levels of gag p24 in the culture supernatants of Jurkat cells and PBMC acutely infected with HIV-1 .
Our data suggest that the c-fos upregulation mediated by Tat might play a significant role in the control of viral gene transactivation .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel proteins are inducible transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular genes .
They are particularly abundant in lymphoid tissues and are thought to be critical for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .
We have reported previously that a nuclear NF-kappa B activity was present in freshly extracted human thymocytes in the absence of in vitro treatment of these cells .
In the present report , we identified NF-kappa B proteins extracted from human thymocyte nuclei as being p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel complexes .
Immunochemical and immunofluorescent staining of thymus sections using specific Abs allowed visualization of nuclear NF-kappa B proteins in both thymocytes and nonthymocyte cells .
This detection suggested a preferential activation of p50/c-Rel in medullary thymocytes , whereas p50/p65 was present in both cortical and medullary regions of human thymus lobules .
However , the intensity of p65 labeling was much higher in several thymocytes from the medulla .
p65 , p50 , and c-Rel activities were found in both CD4- and CD8-positive thymocytes .
These observations suggest that p65 and c-Rel complexes play distinct roles in gene expression and that both forms of NF-kappa B play critical roles during late stages of the intrathymic maturation of T cells .
The ZEBRA protein from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) activates a switch from the latent to the lytic expression program of the virus .
ZEBRA , a member of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins , is a transcriptional activator capable of inducing expression from viral lytic cycle promoters .
It had previously been thought that ZEBRA 's capacity to disrupt EBV latency resided primarily in its ability to activate transcription of genes that encode products required for lytic replication .
We generated a point mutant of ZEBRA , Z ( S186A ) , that was not impaired in its ability to activate transcription ; however , this mutation abolished its ability to initiate the viral lytic cascade .
The mutant , containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein , bound to several known ZEBRA-binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA-responsive promoters but did not disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines .
Therefore , initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the ZEBRA protein requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation ; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the DNA-binding domain of ZEBRA abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the ZEBRA protein in disruption of EBV latency .
The additional function that is required for initiation of the lytic viral life cycle is likely to require phosphorylation of serine 186 of the ZEBRA protein , which may influence either DNA recognition or transcriptional activation of lytic viral promoters in a chromatinized viral episome .
We have previously demonstrated an obligatory requirement for intracellular reactive oxygen species generation during T lymphocyte activation , and have proposed that intracellular reactive oxygen species may act as signalling agents in the regulation of certain cellular processes , for example , during cell cycle entry .
To test this hypothesis , we have been interested to determine which , if any , cell cycle entry events are affected by oxidative signalling .
In earlier studies , we have identified the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 as molecular targets for oxidative signalling processes during cell cycle entry , and have shown that oxidative signalling is involved in the regulation of early changes in gene expression during the G0 to G1 phase transition .
To extend these initial observations , we have examined the effect of antioxidant treatment on the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases erk1 and erk2 , as members of a signal transduction pathway known to directly regulate transcription factor function .
Using as a probe cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with both antioxidant and antiproliferative activity , we have identified erk2 , a key element of the MAP kinase pathway , as being responsive to oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .
These observations provide further evidence to suggest a role for intracellular oxidant generation as a regulatory mechanism during cell cycle entry , and establish a link between oxidative signalling and other aspects of the intracellular signalling network that is activated in response to mitogenic stimulation .
During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) interacts with monocyte/macrophage receptors , resulting in the generation of inflammatory cytokines .
Transcription factor NF-kappaB is crucial in activating the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines .
In this paper , we demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in a promonocytic cell line ( U937 ) followed a rather slow kinetics , depending on the rate of IkappaB-alpha inhibitor hydrolysis .
No degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions .
The transduction pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF-kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide .
This ROS pathway was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors .
This finding indicates that phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase are also involved .
However , the NF-kappaB activation pathway involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did not seem to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells .
For cells of the innate immune system to mount a host defence response to infection , they must recognize products of microbial pathogens such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , the endotoxin secreted by Gram-negative bacteria .
These cellular responses require intracellular signalling pathways , such as the four MAP kinase ( MAPK ) pathways .
In mammalian cells the MAPK p38 is thought to play an important role in the regulation of cellular responses during infection through its effects on the expression of proinflammatory molecules .
One means of understanding the role of p38 in these responses is to identify proteins with functions regulated by p38-catalysed phosphorylation .
Here we demonstrate a link between the p38 pathway and a member of the myocyte-enhancer factor 2 ( MEF2 ) group of transcription factors .
We found that in monocytic cells , LPS increases the transactivation activity of MEF2C through p38-catalysed phosphorylation .
One consequence of MEF2C activation is increased c-jun gene transcription .
Our results show that p38 may influence host defence and inflammation by maintaining the balance of c-Jun protein consumed during infection .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) plays a broad role in gene regulation , but it is not evident whether NF-kappa B acts as a messenger system for germline C epsilon transcription .
We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) participates in NF-kappa B activation responsible for germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 .
Both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-kinase ) , translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C , and nuclear expression of NF-kappa B .
All such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002 , a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase .
In addition , N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , decreased NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4 , anti-CD40 mAb , or their combination .
NAC was also effective in diminishing germline C epsilon transcription , and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb than in those stimulated with IL-4 alone .
These results indicate that IL-4 and ligation of CD40 induce NF-kappa B expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the PI3-kinase pathway and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating germline C epsilon transcription .
The E2F family of transcription factors are thought to play an important role in the control of cell cycle progression .
There is now also increasing evidence that some family members may act as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes .
The characterization of these proteins in human primary haemopoietic cells and acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) blasts may thus give an insight to the molecular mechanisms governing proliferation and leukaemogenesis in these cells .
Therefore we analysed the expression of E2F-DNA binding activity and the constituent proteins found in the complexes in human primary haemopoietic cells of various lineages .
We also studied blasts from 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) .
On electromobility shift assays ( EMSA ) a single E2F-DNA binding complex was detected in T cells , B cells and monocytes which was shown to contain E2F-4 , DP-1 and p130 , indicating that all quiescent haemopoietic cells have the same complex .
Examination of 18 AML samples by EMSA revealed the presence of E2F binding and no gross abnormalities were detected .
An E2F-4/p130 complex was detected in representative samples of all FAB types analysed .
Thus abnormalities of E2F function are unlikely to play a primary pathogenic role in AML .
Clinical deterioration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is associated with increased levels of viral replication and burden in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs .
T cell activation and ensuing cellular gene activation can be critical for HIV-1 replication .
The hypothesis that the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) may influence HIV-1 replication is therefore compelling given the tight correlation of HIV-1 transcriptional induction to T cell activation .
We report that certain NF-AT ( Rel ) family members productively bind the kappaB regulatory elements , synergize with NF-kappaB and Tat in transcriptional activation of HIV-1 , and enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells .
These results link regulatory factors critical to T cell commitment directly to HIV-1 replication .
BACKGROUND : The reduction of symptoms due to treatment with corticosteroids varies among patients with perennial rhinitis .
Most patients will respond but a few patients respond less to these drugs .
OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association in reduction of symptoms due to glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptor characteristics in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis , in vitro glucocorticoid receptor binding studies were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells using dexamethasone and in vitro production of mediators were measured .
METHODS : During a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study , 200 micrograms fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray ( in the active treatment period ) and placebo ( in the placebo treatment period ) were administered twice daily for 2 weeks to 22 patients allergic to house dust mite .
At the end of both treatment periods symptoms were scored after allergen provocation ( 100 , 1000 , 10000 BU/mL ) and during the 9.5 hours after this challenge .
Receptor binding studies with dexamethasone were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Leukotriene B4 produced by monocytes in vitro and soluble interleukin-2 receptor released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels in plasma were determined .
RESULTS : No significant partial correlations of the number of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors ( 6821 +/- 5669 binding sites per cell ) and the affinity ( Kd : 16.5 +/- 13.51 nmol/L ) for the glucocorticoid receptors with the symptom score ( placebo : 4.3 +/- 2.45 pts ; fluticasone : 2.4 +/- 1.55 pts ) after active treatment were found .
Also no significant partial correlations of the levels of leukotriene B4 ( 45.6 +/- 105.3 ng/10(6) cells ) produced by monocytes in vitro , soluble interleukin-2 receptor ( 734 +/- 237 ng/10(6) cells ) released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels ( 571 +/- 236 ng/mL ) in plasma with the symptom score after active treatment were found .
CONCLUSIONS : The reduction of symptoms due to topical fluticasone propionate in patients with rhinitis and allergy to house dust mite is not correlated with the characteristics of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Cytokine and growth factor receptor engagement leads to the rapid phosphorylation and activation of latent , cytosolic signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins , which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcriptional events from specific promoter sequences .
STAT3 expression in particular has been associated with Abl , Src , and HTLV-1 transformation of normal cells .
B-1 lymphocytes are self-renewing , CD5+ B cells that display a propensity for malignant transformation and are the normal counterpart to human chronic lymphocytic leukemias .
Further , B-1 cells are characterized by aberrant intracellular signaling , including hyperresponsiveness to phorbol ester PKC agonists .
Here we demonstrate that B-1 lymphocytes constitutively express nuclear activated STAT3 , which is not expressed by unmanipulated conventional ( B-2 ) lymphocytes .
In contrast , STAT3 activation is induced in B-2 cells after antigen receptor engagement in a delayed fashion ( after 3 h ) .
Induction of STAT3 is inhibited by both the serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and requires de novo protein synthesis , demonstrating novel coupling between sIg and STAT proteins that differs from the classical paradigm for STAT induction by cytokine receptors .
The inability of prolonged stimulation of conventional B-2 cells with anti-Ig , a treatment sufficient to induce CD5 expression , to result in sustained STAT3 activation suggests that STAT3 is a specific nuclear marker for B-1 cells .
Thus , STAT3 may play a role in B cell antigen-specific signaling responses , and its constitutive activation is associated with a normal cell population exhibiting intrinsic proliferative behavior .
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the chronic gut inflammation observed in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases ( e.g. ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) is associated with enhanced production of leukocyte-derived oxidants .
Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide are known to activate certain transcription factors such as nuclear transcription factor kappa beta .
Nuclear transcription factor kB ( NF-kappa B ) is a ubiquitous transcription factor and pleiotropic regulator of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses .
This transcription factor is activated via the selective phosphorylation , ubiquination and degradation of its inhibitor protein I-kB thereby allowing translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus where it upregulates the transcription of a variety of adhesion molecules ( e.g. ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 ) , cytokines ( TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 ) and enzymes ( iNOS ) .
The proteolytic degradation of the post-translationally modified I-kappa B is known to be mediated by the 26S proteasome complex .
Based upon work from our laboratory , we propose that inhibition of NF-kappa B activation produces significant anti inflammatory activity which may be mediated by the inhibition of transcription of certain pro-inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules .
Biological markers of ovulation , after a great in the past , have been fallen into disuse for the large diffusion of biochemical and biophysical ones .
However , the real effect of hormones involved in ovulation is expressed by biological modifications on target tissues .
To explore the modifications of not reproductive target tissues as ovulation markers we studied the behaviour of Albuminemia , Platelet Factor IV ( as indicator of Platelet Aggregation ) , Type II estrogenic receptors in 42 ovulation induced women , undergoing our observation .
33 of them had ovulation and 9 developed a LUF syndrome , constituting two biological models of an opposite situation for the three markers observed .
All the markers considered were sufficiently sensitive , but among them , Platelet Factor IV was the most reliable to the hormonal ovulatory situation .
Intimate interactions between multipotential hemopoietic stem cells and their microenvironment work towards redefining the identity and the differentiative fate of these primitive cells .
Molecular cues delivered by the microenvironment frequently act in an instructive fashion by initiating intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately target a select group of transcription factors .
These transcriptional regulators in turn trigger a cascade of genetic changes that ultimately determine the course of the cells during differentiation .
Gene inactivation studies on the PU.1 , Ikaros and GATA-3 genes have revealed that their encoded factors are essential for the earliest commitment step into the B and T lymphoid lineages .
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) have long been used as the most effective agents for the treatment of allergic diseases accompanied by eosinophilia such as chronic asthma and atopic dermatitis .
The development of chronic eosinophilic inflammation is dependent on interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , a selective eosinophil-activating factor , produced by helper T cells .
To delineate the regulatory mechanisms of human IL-5 synthesis , we established allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from asthmatic patients .
GC efficiently suppressed IL-5 synthesis of T-cell clones activated via either T-cell receptor ( TCR ) or IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) .
Induction of IL-5 mRNA upon TCR and IL-2R stimulation was totally inhibited by dexamethasone .
Human IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct transfected to T-cell clones was transcribed on either TCR or IL-2R stimulation and was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , indicating that the approximately 500-bp human IL-5 gene segment located 5' upstream of the coding region contains activation-inducible enhancer elements responsible for the regulation by GC .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis suggested that AP-1 and NF-kappaB are among the possible targets of GC actions on TCR-stimulated T cells .
NF-AT and NF-kappaB were not significantly induced by IL-2 stimulation .
Our results showing that GC suppressed IL-5 production by human CD4+ T cells activated by two distinct stimuli , TCR and IL-2R stimulation , underscore the efficacy of GC in the treatment of allergic diseases via suppression of T-cell IL-5 synthesis .
Serum amyloid A ( SAA ) has been linked to atherosclerosis because of its ability to remodel high-density lipoprotein by the depletion of apolipoprotein A1 , its ability to bind cholesterol , and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques of coronary and carotid arteries .
In the present study , we investigated the induction mechanism of SAA gene in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells which play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic fatty streak and plaque formation .
We and others have shown that SAA gene is induced in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
By promoter function analysis , we show that the SAA promoter sequence between -280 and -226 can confer LPS responsiveness .
Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay detected an induced DNA-binding activity in these cells in response to LPS .
Characterization of the DNA-binding protein by UV cross-linking , Southwestern blot , and antibody ablation/supershift assays revealed that it is similar to a recently reported nuclear factor designated SAF .
These results demonstrated that LPS-mediated SAA gene induction in monocyte/macrophage cells is primarily due to the induction of SAF activity .
Neutrophil elastase ( NE ) and cathepsin G are two serine proteinases released concomitantly by stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils .
We previously demonstrated that while NE by itself does not activate human platelets , it strongly enhances the weak aggregation induced by a threshold concentration of cathepsin G ( threshold of cathepsin G ) ( Renesto , P. , and Chignard , M. ( 1993 ) Blood 82 , 139-144 ) .
The aim of this study was to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in this potentiation process .
Two main pieces of data prompted us to focus on the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor , the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin .
First , previous studies have shown this integrin to be particularly prone to proteolytic regulation of its function .
Second , we found that the potentiating activity of NE on the threshold of cathepsin G-induced platelet aggregation was strictly dependent on the presence of exogenous fibrinogen .
Using flow cytometry analysis , NE was shown to trigger a time-dependent binding of PAC-1 and AP-5 , two monoclonal antibodies specific for the activated and ligand-occupied conformers of alphaIIbbeta3 .
Furthermore , the potentiated aggregation was shown to result from an increased capacity of platelets to bind fibrinogen .
Indeed , the combination of NE and threshold of cathepsin G increased the binding of PAC-1 approximately 5.5-fold over basal values measured on nontreated platelets , whereas this binding raised only by approximately 3-fold in threshold of cathepsin G-stimulated platelets ( p < 0.05 ) .
By contrast , phosphatidic acid accumulation , pleckstrin phosphorylation , and calcium mobilization produced by the combination of NE and threshold of cathepsin G were not significantly different from those measured with threshold of cathepsin G alone ( p > 0.05 ) , indicating that the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway is not involved in the potentiation of aggregation .
The foregoing data , as well as the requirement of catalytically active NE to trigger alphaIIbbeta3 activation and potentiate threshold of cathepsin G-initiated platelet aggregation , led us to examine whether the structure of this integrin was affected by NE .
Immunoblot and flow cytometry analysis revealed a limited proteolysis of the carboxyl terminus of the alphaIIb subunit heavy chain ( alphaIIbH ) , as judged by the disappearance of the epitope for the monoclonal antibody PMI-1 .
Mass spectrometry studies performed on a synthetic peptide mapping over the cleavage domain of alphaIIbH predicted the site of proteolysis as located between Val837 and Asp838 .
Treatment by NE of ATP-depleted platelets or Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human recombinant alphaIIbbeta3 clearly established that activation of the integrin was independent of signal transduction events and was concomitant with the proteolysis of alphaIIbH .
Transcription factor E2F binds to cellular promoters of certain growth- and cell cycle-controlling genes and forms distinct heteromeric complexes with other nuclear proteins .
It has therefore been proposed that E2F is involved in cellular proliferation control .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .
We show here by mobility-shift assay that E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes were detected in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients but not in an uninfected T-cell line , Jurkat , and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The Tax protein , encoded by HTLV-I , is a potent transcription activator of viral and several cellular genes .
We demonstrate that expression of Tax can induce the E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes in Jurkat T cells .
Thus , Tax , through enhancement of the DNA-binding activity of E2F , may be capable of regulating cellular gene expression implicated in the proliferation and transformation of T cells in ATL .
This activity may be relevant to the mechanisms whereby HTLV-I which does not contain oncogenes induces neoplasia .
In this report , we demonstrate that the AP-1 site and a distal promoter element regulate transcriptional induction of collagenase-1 during monocytic differentiation .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression constructs containing regions of the human collagenase-1 promoter were stably or transiently transfected into U937 cells , and reporter activity was assessed at various times after the onset of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -mediated differentiation .
Rapid and strong induction of promoter activity was lost in constructs with a mutant AP-1 element ; however , at 16-96 h post-PMA , the mutant collagenase-1 promoter displayed AP-1 independent PMA-mediated transactivation .
The AP-1 mutant constructs also showed delayed transcriptional activation in PMA-treated fibroblasts .
Western and supershift analyses indicated that functional Jun and Fos proteins were present in nuclear extracts of PMA-differentiated U937 cells .
Promoter deletion constructs demonstrated the potential role of distal promoter sequences in regulating collagenase-1 transcription .
In particular , Western , supershift , and promoter deletion analyses suggested a role for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta ( C/EBP-beta ) binding site between -2010 and -1954 in regulating transcription of collagenase-1 in monocytic cells .
Our findings suggest that distinct regulatory elements , acting somewhat independently of each other , control expression of collagenase-1 .
In addition , our data suggests that the rapid PMA-mediated induction of collagenase-1 transcription is controlled by a mechanism distinct from that regulating the sustained expression of this proteinase in activated macrophages .
Ascorbic acid ( ascorbate or vitamin C ) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in latently infected T lymphocytic cells following stimulation with a tumor promoter ( PMA ) and inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-alpha ) .
To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor , NF-kappa B , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or absence of ascorbate , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine ( AZT ) .
Pretreatment of ACH-2 T cells by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA , TNF-alpha , or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) resulted in strong suppression of NF-kappa B activation .
In contrast , neither ascorbate nor AZT affected NF-kappa B activity under all three induction conditions in the ACH-2 cell line .
Ascorbate and AZT also had no effect on NF-kappa B activation following TNF-alpha- or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells .
These results suggest that the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is not mediated via NF-kappa B inhibition , unlike that seen with other antioxidants .
In this report , we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV , LAI , does not replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated by cross-linking CD3 and CD28 .
In contrast , LAI replicates well in memory CD4 T cells stimulated in the same way .
Unlike this physiologically relevant stimulation , PHA stimulates productive LAI replication in both naive and memory T cells .
These studies were conducted with highly purified ( FACS-isolated ) subsets of CD4 T cells identified by expression of both CD45RA and CD62L .
Remixing of purified T cells showed that naive T cells do not suppress LAI replication in memory T cells and that memory T cells do not restore LAI expression in naive T cells .
The suppression of productive LAI replication in naive T cells is not due to differential expression of viral coreceptors , nor is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV transcription factors , nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 .
The inherent resistance of naive T cells to productive HIV infection , coupled with their proliferative advantage as demonstrated here , provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of CD4 T cells from HIV-infected adults .
The complex network of cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immunoregulatory responses plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection .
RANTES ( regulated upon activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted ) is a cytokine that belongs to the beta-chemokine family ; it is chemoattractant for CD4+/CD45RO T cells , it is produced by various cell types including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as monocytes/macrophages , and has recently been shown to suppress replication of macrophage-tropic strains of HIV in CD4+ T cells .
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of RANTES expression , the RANTES promoter region was analyzed by transient expression and gel-mobility shift assays .
We demonstrate that : 1 ) RANTES promoter activity is up-regulated by PMA plus ionomycin , coexpression of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B , the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta , and the CD28 costimulatory pathway ; 2 ) the RANTES promoter region contains four NF-kappa B binding sites at positions -30 , -44 , -213 , and -579 relative to the transcription start site ; 3 ) one site ( -213 ) is an NF-AT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) binding site that also has weak affinity to NF-kappa B , and the most distal site ( -579 ) also serves as a CD28-responsive element ; and 4 ) mutation on any of those NF-kappa B sites or coexpression of I kappa B alpha ( cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappa B ) markedly reduced the promoter activity .
Thus , NF-kappa B , a potent transcriptional activator of HIV expression , is also involved in the expression of RANTES , a chemokine that blocks infection by macrophage-tropic strains of HIV .
Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells , plays a crucial role in regulating interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production and in the generation of IFN-gamma-producing T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells .
Here we show that the IL-12 receptor ( IL-12R ) beta 2 subunit , a recently cloned binding and signal transducing component of the IL-12R , is expressed on human Th1 but not Th2 clones and is induced during differentiation of human naive cells along the Th1 but not the Th2 pathway .
IL-12 and type I but not type II interferons induce expression of the IL-12R beta 2 chain during in vitro T cell differentiation after antigen receptor triggering .
The selective expression and regulation of the IL-12R beta 2 subunit may help to understand the basis of Th1/Th2 differentiation and may provide therapeutic options for altering the Th1/Th2 balance in several immuno-pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies .
The malignant cells of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) contain a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fuses the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( PML ) with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene ( RAR alpha ) .
To test the hypothesis that the chimera PMLRAR alpha plays a role in leukemogenesis , we expressed a PMLRAR alpha cDNA in myeloid cells of transgenic mice .
PMLRAR alpha transgenic mice exhibited impaired neutrophil maturation early in life , which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL .
Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice , and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL .
The APL recapitulated features of the human disease , including a response to retinoic acid .
Retinoic acid caused the leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro and in vivo , eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice .
Our results demonstrate that PMLRAR alpha impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL .
The transgenic mice described here provide an apparently accurate model for human APL that includes clear evidence of tumor progression .
The model should be useful for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms of the therapeutic response to retinoic acid , as well as for preclinical studies of therapeutic regimens .
The E2A-HLF ( hepatic leukemia factor ) oncoprotein , generated in pro-B lymphocytes by fusion of the trans-activation domain of E2A to the basic region/leucine zipper ( bZIP ) domain of HLF , functions as an anti-apoptotic transcription factor in leukemic cell transformation .
When introduced into interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) -dependent mouse pro-B lymphocytes , E2A-HLF prevents apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation , suggesting that IL-3 mediates cell survival through activation of a transcription factor whose activity can be constitutively replaced by the chimeric oncoprotein .
We considered four bZIP transcription factors as candidates for this putative IL-3-regulated factor , each of which binds avidly to the DNA consensus sequence recognized by E2A-HLF and is related to the Caenorhabditis elegans CES-2 ( cell death specification protein ) neuron-specific mediator of cell death .
The expression and binding activity of the Nfil3 protein ( also called E4bp4 ) , but not of Hlf , Dbp , or Tef , was found to be regulated by IL-3 in mouse pro-B cell lines ( Baf-3 and FL5.12 ) .
Northern blot analysis showed that Nfil3/E4bp4 is regulated as a " delayed-early " IL-3-responsive gene , requiring de novo protein synthesis .
In the absence of IL-3 , enforced expression of the human NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA promoted the survival but not the growth of IL-3-dependent pro-B cells .
Our results implicate NFIL3/E4BP4 ( nuclear factor regulated by IL-3/adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein ) in a distinct growth factor-regulated signaling pathway that is responsible for the survival of early B-cell progenitors , and whose alteration by E2A-HLF leads to childhood B lineage leukemia .
Assembly of terminal complement complexes ( TCC ) C5b-7 , C5b-8 , and C5b-9 on target cells during acute and chronic inflammation induces hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids and heterotrimeric G protein activation .
TCC also stimulate a variety of cellular activities , which include cytokine synthesis , proto-oncogene activation , and mitotic signaling .
Now we report that sublytic TCC induced Ras , Raf-1 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 activation in JY25 B cell line .
When cells were exposed to C5b-9 , GTP-bound Ras in anti-C5b-9 immunoprecipitates was increased 3.2-fold at 2 min , while GTP-bound Ras in anti-Ras immunoprecipitates was increased 2-fold at 10 min .
Both C5b-9 and C5b-7 , but not C5b6 , increased Raf-1 kinase activity maximum 3.3-fold at 2 min and 2.8-fold at 5 min , respectively .
ERK1 activity was 2-fold increased by C5b-9 at 2 min and by C5b-7 at 10 min , over the C5b6 level .
The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway on TCC-inducible mitotic signaling was evaluated by assessing DNA synthesis and activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) DNA-binding activity .
The MAPK/ERK-specific inhibitor PD 098,059 abolished the C5b-9-induced DNA synthesis .
Involvement of G protein in the activation of MAPK pathway by TCC was indicated by inhibition of Raf-1 and ERK1 kinase activity , as well as the DNA synthesis by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin .
Overexpression of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 carboxyl-terminal peptide in JY25 cells also inhibited Raf-1 and ERK1 activity , indicating a direct involvement of G betagamma subunits in the signal transduction generated through activation of MAPK pathway by TCC assembly in the plasma membrane .
The HLA DQA1 locus is polymorphic .
Haplotypes containing HLA DQA1*0501 , but not HLA DQA1*0201 , together with HLA DQB1*0201 are associated with Grave 's disease and celiac sprue .
In this report , we demonstrate a functional correlate of DQA1 polymorphism .
T cells infiltrating a herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) lesion from a HLA DQ 2,7 individual yielded a virus-specific CD4+ clone restricted by DQ2 .
Presentation of viral peptide and protein segregated with DQA1 allele , because cell lines bearing DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 heterodimers presented antigen in proliferation and cytotoxicity assays much more efficiently than cell lines bearing DQA1*0201/DQB1*0201 .
Binding of viral peptide to cell lines bearing DQA1*0201 , in comparison to DQA1*0501 , was only moderately reduced and may not explain this effect .
Truncation and substitution analyses of peptide binding and T-cell activation were performed to determine which viral peptide residues contacting TCR might therefore be presented in an altered conformation by DQA1*0201/DQB1*0201 .
Residues 432 , 435 , 437 , 438 , and 440 ( position P1 , P4 , P6 , P7 , and P9 ) contributed to DQ2 binding , whereas residues 431 , 433 , 434 , and 436 ( positions P 1 , P2 , P3 , and P5 ) contributed to TCR contact .
Differential presentation of peptide by HLA DQ2 heterodimers varying at the DQA1 locus may have relevance to host defense and the pathogenesis of HLA DQ2-associated autoimmune diseases .
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance in patients with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) seriously impairs successive GC therapy after renal transplantation .
We examined the relationship between GC-receptor ( GC-R ) parameters in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and PBMC resistance to GC in 21 CRF patients and 18 healthy subjects .
Each subject group was divided into two subgroups according to PBMC sensitivity to prednisolone in a mitogen assay procedure ; i.e. , sensitive ( IC50 < 381 ng/mL ) and resistant ( IC50 > 381 ng/mL ) groups .
In healthy subjects , the mean GC-R Bmax and Kd in quiescent PBMC of the GC-sensitive group were 2.89 +/- 1.23 fmol/10(6) cells and 4.00 +/- 2.24 nM , respectively .
The Bmax in these subjects significantly increased to 6.61 +/- 2.02 ( 257.7 +/- 107.8 % ) after 24 h stimulation with concanavalin A ( p < 0.01 ) , while the Kd change was not significant .
The GC-R Bmax and Kd in quiescent PBMC of the GC-resistant group were 5.33 +/- 1.37 fmol/10(6) cells and 3.20 +/- 1.39 nM , respectively .
Both of these parameters , however , did not change significantly after mitogen stimulation .
There was a significant negative correlation between IC50S of prednisolone and increase-ratios ( post/pre ratio ) of Bmax after mitogen stimulation ( p < 0.05 ) .
In CRF patients , Bmax and Kd in quiescent PBMC of the GC-sensitive group were 6.04 +/- 2.35 fmol/10(6) cells and 3.49 +/- 1.72 nM , respectively , while those in PBMC of the GC-resistant group were 5.13 +/- 2.31 fmol/10(6) cells and 4.04 +/- 1.62 nM , respectively .
The Bmax and Kd were not significantly changed after mitogen stimulation in both subgroups of CRF .
Moreover , in contrast to healthy subjects , there was no correlation between IC50 and GC-R parameters in CRF .
We concluded that , in healthy subjects , decreased PBMC capacity to amplify GC-R numbers in response to mitogen is correlated with GC resistance , whereas in CRF patients the resistant mechanism is not correlated with GC-R parameters .
An unknown event might be involved in GC-resistance of CRF .
Germline transcripts initiate from promoters upstream of the immunoglobulin switch region , and are necessary to target the appropriate switch region for recombination and switching .
Different cytokines activate transcription at the appropriate germline promoter .
Because binding sites for B-cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) are located upstream of several switch regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster , BSAP might play a role in the regulation of germline transcription and isotype switching .
We investigated whether BSAP plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the epsilon germline promoter in human B cells .
Our results showed that BSAP plays a role in both IL-4-dependent induction and CD40-mediated upregulation of human epsilon germline transcription .
BSAP is unique among the transcription factors that regulate epsilon germline expression , because it is B cell specific , and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for IgE switching .
The A6H monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) recognizes a 120,000-140,000 MW antigen that is expressed at similar densities on 85-90 % of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and on renal cell carcinomas .
The binding of the A6H mAb induced a costimulatory signal in anti-CD3 activated T cells .
In the present report , we show that A6H costimulated cell proliferation and cytokine production in purified CD4+ T cells .
Unexpectedly , the CD8+ T-cell subpopulation failed to respond .
CD4+ T cells costimulated with the A6H mAb upregulated CD80 , CD86 , CD71 , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) R alpha , IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma , while no corresponding up-regulation of these cell surface molecules was seen in CD8+ T cells .
In order to investigate the nature of the A6H mAb costimulus at the transcriptional level we have examined induction of the transcription factors OCT-1 , AP-1 and NF-kappa B which are known to be transcriptional regulators of several cytokine and cytokine receptor genes , including the IL-2 and IL-2R genes .
Co-ligation of the A6H antigen and the CD3 complex induced expression of the transcription factor AP-1 in CD4+ T cells , whereas no increase in NF-kappa B and octamer-binding ( Oct ) proteins was seen compared to T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone .
Furthermore , no induction of AP-1 was seen in A6H costimulated CD8+ T cells .
These results suggests that both proximal steps in CD8+ T-cell activation as well as the later phases are unresponsive to A6H ligation .
Molecular differences of the A6H molecule or distinct regulation of the A6H transduced AP-1 activation pathway may exist in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations .
PO-B was originally characterized as a transcriptional regulatory factor of the pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) gene ; however , it has become increasingly clear that this protein may be active in tissues outside the pituitary , since it is present in diverse cell types , including differentiated HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells .
We previously showed that PO-B DNA-binding is progressively induced during differentiation of promyelomonocytic leukemic HL-60 cells to the macrophage-like lineage ( with phorbol esters ) .
We now report that PO-B DNA-binding in HL-60 cells is similarly induced during differentiation to the granulocytic lineage ( with either retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide ) .
Either a genetic or pharmacologic blockade of HL-60 differentiation prohibited these inductive effects .
These studies have prompted our interest in the dynamics of other transcription factor changes during HL-60 differentiation .
Of these , we observed that another transcription factor ( AP-1 ) is also robustly induced at the DNA-binding level during macrophage-like HL-60 differentiation , but not during granulocytic differentiation .
Conversely , the DNA-binding of the transcription factor AP-2 was slightly reduced by TPA-induced HL-60 differentiation but unchanged during granulocyte differentiation .
From these data , we conclude that the induction of PO-B DNA binding is a general marker of HL-60 myelomonocytic differentiation , but that qualitative aspects of the induction of additional distinct transcription factors , such as AP-1 , may contribute to lineage-specific determinants of cell fate .
Adenovirus can establish persistent infections which may reactivate and cause disease in immunocompromised hosts .
Lymphocytes have been postulated to serve as a site of adenoviral persistence based upon the ability to isolate adenovirus from tonsils and to detect adenovirus DNA by Southern blot hybridization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
To test this hypothesis , a more sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay was developed to detect adenovirus DNA .
Two sets of nested primers were designed to conserved sequences in the adenovirus E1A and hexon genes .
The E1A and hexon primers amplified DNA from representative adenoviral serotypes in all six adenoviral groups ( A-F ) .
Both primers detected a single copy of the adenovirus type 2 genome but were less sensitive for the group B type 35 .
None of 33 PBMC specimens from healthy adults and only one of 40 pediatric samples was positive ( at a low level ) for adenovirus DNA by nested PCR assay .
In comparison , PBMC from two children with fatal adenoviral infection were both strongly positive for adenovirus DNA .
It is concluded that , in contrast to a previous study , PBMC are not a common site of persistent group C adenoviral infection .
In addition , assay of PBMC by the adenovirus-specific PCR may help detect early invasive disease and warrants further evaluation .
The immunoregulatory properties of prolactin , a pituitary peptide hormone , have received renewed attention .
The prolactin receptor , a member of the hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily , is ubiquitously expressed by cells in the immune system .
Certain subpopulations of lymphocytes synthesize and secrete biologically active prolactin , which suggests that prolactin can act as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor to modulate the activities of cells of the immune system .
This review focuses on the molecular actions of prolactin in the immune system .
Emphasis is given to recent information about the molecular mechanisms of prolactin receptor signal transduction , and the signaling molecules and prolactin-inducible target genes that participate in these responses .
In particular , the prolactin-inducible interferon regulatory factor-1 gene and its roles in mediating diverse immune responses .
Mutants of type 5 adenovirus ( Ad5 ) with reiterated DNA sequences in the E1a region appeared in a human T-lymphocyte cell line , Molt-4 , persistently infected with H5sub304 , a deletion/substitution mutant that has a wild-type phenotype in viral replication .
Endonuclease analyses and DNA sequencing revealed DNA reiteration in each mutant .
In the four representative mutants investigated , the DNA reiterations all started within a six-base-pair consensus sequence , G ( or C ) CTGTG , located in the second exon of the E1a region ( at nt 1333 , 1367 , or 1419 ) .
There was not any DNA homology between the breakpoints in the second exon and the inserting sequences ( starting at nt 532 , 710 , or 792 ) .
Northern analyses suggested that the reiterated splicing sites of the representative mutants were all used in RNA splicing , and the closest donor and recipient joints were used most frequently .
These observations imply that during persistent infection Ad5 underwent spontaneous mutations by sequence-specific breakage and nonhomologous end-end joining recombination events .
These E1a reiteration mutants could be propagated in HeLa , A549 , and KB cells ; they were genetically stable ; and they killed CREF cells at a strikingly high frequency .
Preliminary observations tend to correlate this CREF cell killing with the accumulation of the early viral proteins and/or viral DNA in the infected cells .
This degree of cell damage was not observed in Ad5wt or H5sub304 infection of CREF cells .
The observed E1a reiterations provide a model to gain insight into understanding the evolutionary events of some , if not all , adenovirus types during many years of symbiotic , persistent relationship in human tonsils and adenoids and possibly other lymphoid organs .
T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha and delta gene segments are organized within a single genetic locus but are differentially regulated during T cell development .
An enhancer-blocking element ( BEAD-1 , for blocking element alpha/delta 1 ) was localized to a 2.0-kb region 3' of TCR delta gene segments and 5' of TCR alpha joining gene segments within this locus .
BEAD-1 blocked the ability of the TCR delta enhancer ( Edelta ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a chromatin-integrated construct .
We propose that BEAD-1 functions as a boundary that separates the TCR alpha/delta locus into distinct regulatory domains controlled by Edelta and the TCR alpha enhancer , and that it prevents Edelta from opening the chromatin of the TCR alpha joining gene segments for VDJ recombination at an early stage of T cell development .
BACKGROUND : The immediate early genes ( IE ) of human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can be expressed in monocytic cells and are known to regulate viral and cellular genes .
Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) plays a central role in numerous inflammatory and immune processes .
Interleukin-6 levels are increased in lung transplant patients clinically diagnosed with CMV pneumonitis .
The regulation of IL-6 is dependent on various stimuli that include lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , viruses , and other cytokines .
These studies examined the ability of CMV IE gene products to modulate IL-6 production .
METHODS : THP-1 cells , a monocytic cell line , were transfected with the CMV IE genes .
Interleukin-6 protein and IL-6 mRNA were measured in control and CMV immediate early transfected cells .
Cotransfection of CMV IE genes and IL-6 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) or IL-6 luciferase constructs were used to study IL-6 promoter activity .
RESULTS : Interleukin-6 protein and mRNA production were significantly increased in cells transfected with the CMV IE genes and stimulated with LPS compared to LPS-stimulated control cells .
Cytomegalovirus IE gene products significantly enhanced LPS stimulation of IL-6 promoter activity in both IL-6 CAT and IL-6 luciferase assays .
A deletion construct that contains a NF-kappa B site but is missing the multiple response region demonstrated a continued increase in IL-6 luciferase activity in LPS-stimulated CMV transfected cells .
CONCLUSION : Cytomegalovirus immediate early gene products significantly enhanced expression of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated cells .
The increase in IL-6 luciferase activity occurs in the absence of the multiple response region , the area of the IL-6 promoter responsive to IL-1 , TNF alpha , cyclic amp , and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
The ability of CMV IE gene products to enhance IL-6 production may play an important role in immune inflammatory states associated with CMV infection .
Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is an important B-cell growth and differentiation factor .
IL-6 treatment of the human lymphoblastoid cell line , SKW6.4 , leads to increased IgM production .
We have previously shown that IL-6 induces activation of JAK1 and JAK2 in human B cell lines .
A chimeric IL-6 receptor , comprised of the intracellular tail of the IL-6 receptor subunit gp130 fused to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor , was stably transfected into SKW6.4 cells .
EGF treatment induced IgM production in cells transfected with an intact gp130 cytoplasmic tail , but not in untransfected cells or cells transfected with a cytoplasmic tail lacking all four signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) binding sites .
Moreover , EGF treatment induced Stat3 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the intact chimeric EGF-gp130 receptor along with induction of DNA-mobility shift of a classical interferon-gamma-activated site .
To define further the relation between Stat3 activation and enhanced IgM production , we determined the effect of chimeric gp130 on the transcriptional activation of a genetic element linked to immunoglobulin production , namely the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( IgH-enhancer ) .
Parental as well as transfected SKW6.4 cells were transiently transfected with an IgH-enhancer-luciferase construct .
The transcriptional activity of the IgH-luciferase construct was induced upon ligation of the full-length chimeric receptor but not by truncated gp130 receptors .
Moreover , the gp130-induced activity of this reporter gene was abrogated by Stat3EE , a mutant Stat3 incapable of binding DNA .
These results indicate that IL-6-induced B-cell differentiation , as measured by IgM production , may be controlled by Stat3 proteins .
The role of cellular redox status in both cytotoxic activity and NF-kappa B activation in natural killer ( NK ) cells was investigated .
The results indicate that stimulation of NK cells , either freshly isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) or long-term cultured NK clones , with specific cell targets results in an increased binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 transcription factors measured by gel retardation .
Pretreatment of NK cells with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbarmate ( PDTC ) leads to the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation but the AP-1 binding to DNA was superinduced .
The inhibition of NF-kappa B by PDTC paralleled with an inhibition of spontaneous cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells .
Moreover , the inhibitors of serine proteases , N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone , also blocked the cytolytic activity of NK cells against the sensitive target K562 .
In contrast , NK activity was not affected by pretreatment of the effector cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal which selectively inhibits NF-kappa B activation .
Altogether , these results support the hypothesis that the activation of NK cells involved transcriptional and post-transcriptional events , and that reactive intermediates may play an important role in the molecular processes related with the generation of a cytotoxic response by NK cells .
The cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -4 and IL-13 play a critical role in inducing Cepsilon germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in human B cells .
The IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) in B cells is composed of two chains , the IL-4-binding IL-4Ralpha chain , which is shared with the IL-13R , and the IL-2Rgamma ( gammac ) chain , which is shared with IL-7R , IL-9R , and IL-15R .
IL-4 induces Cepsilon germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in B cells from patients with gammac chain deficiency .
Induction of Cepsilon germline transcripts by IL-4 in B cells that lack the gammac chain may involve signaling via the IL-13R .
Alternatively , the IL-4Ralpha chain may transduce intracellular signals that lead to Cepsilon gene transcription independently of its association with other chains .
We show that ligand-induced homodimerization of chimeric surface receptors consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the erythropoietin receptor and of the intracellular domain of IL-4Ralpha induces Janus kinase 1 ( Jak1 ) activation , STAT6 activation , and Cepsilon germline transcripts in human B cell line BJAB .
Disruption of the Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region of IL-4Ralpha abolished signaling by this chimeric receptor .
Furthermore , B cells transfected with a chimeric CD8alpha/IL-4Ralpha receptor , which is expressed on the cell surface as a homodimer , constitutively expressed Cepsilon germline transcripts .
These results suggest that homodimerization of the IL-4Ralpha chain is sufficient to transduce Jak1-dependent intracellular signals that lead to IgE isotype switching .
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell types .
We have previously shown that in T cells the PI3-K inhibitor , wortmannin , interferes with activation of the mitogen-activated kinase , Erk2 , after T cell receptor ( TcR ) stimulation .
To further explore the involvement of PI3-K in T cell activation , we created a set of potentially dominant negative PI3-K constructs comprising individual or tandem domains of the regulatory p85 subunit and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like Erk2 activation and transcription from an NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) element taken from the interleukin-2 promoter .
Following TcR stimulation , activation of Erk2 was only inhibited by a previously described truncated form of p85 that can not bind the catalytic subunit , but not by other constructs of p85 .
In contrast , several mutant p85 alleles had dramatic effects on NFAT activation .
Most interestingly , the N-terminal SH2 domain had an inhibitory effect , whereas a mutant p85 containing only the two SH2 domains enhanced basal NFAT activity in a Ras-dependent manner .
Ionomycin induced synergistic activation of NFAT in cells expressing p85 mutants that contained the C-terminal SH2 domain .
Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins bound to truncated p85 constructs revealed cooperative binding of the two SH2 domains but no apparent differences between the N- and C- terminal SH2 domains .
Wortmannin did not interfere with NFAT activation , although it inhibited PI3-K and Erk2 activation in the same experiment .
These results suggest that PI3-K is involved in NFAT activation through a complex adaptor function of its regulatory subunit and that its lipid kinase activity is dispensable for this effect .
To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of binding to the human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) , we developed a new monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) raised against the hormone-binding domain ( HBD ) .
For this purpose , mice were immunized with a fusion protein including the sequence Thr729-Lys984 of hMR .
After ELISA screening , mAb 18C7 was selected for its specificity towards the HBD .
This antibody recognized both the denatured and native MR forms , as well as the hetero-oligomeric MR form and the transformed MR state .
By using several HBD subfragments , the mAb 18C7 epitope was located in the N-terminal region of the HBD from Thr729 to Leu765 .
We then studied the effect of the antibody on aldosterone and progesterone binding to the hMR .
When 18C7 was incubated with liganded MR , it was able to partly displace ( 20 % ) the hormone from its binding site .
When 18C7 was incubated with MR before aldosterone or progesterone , the antibody inhibited 75-80 % of the binding .
The effect of 18C7 on the binding was similar with both hormones .
A sucrose gradient analysis indicated the simultaneous presence of two kinds of receptor complexes : the steroid-MR complex and the antibody-MR complex .
After its associated proteins , especially the heat-shock protein hsp90 , had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate , 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor .
Our results indicated that the epitope recognized by 18C7 was directly implicated in hormone binding .
The lack of steroid binding of HBD mutants with the Thr729-Leu765 sequence deleted [ Jalaguier , Mesnier , Leger and Auzou ( 1996 ) J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Biol.57 , 43-50 ] supports this hypothesis .
Because of the similar behaviours of aldosterone and progesterone , we conclude that the N-terminal Thr729-Leu765 region of the HBD is similarly involved in the binding of both hormones .
Differentiation generally leads to cell cycle arrest .
Human leukemia HL60 cells respond to the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25D3 ) by expressing a number of markers of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and become arrested predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
We have recently reported a series ( A ) of 1,25D3-resistant variants of HL60 cells which proliferate in the presence of 1,25D3 and do not express differentiation markers ( Exp. Cell Res. 224 , 312 , 1996 ) .
We now describe another series ( B ) of such variants , which differ from A series cells grown in similar concentrations of 1,25D3 in that they express the CD14 antigen and nonspecific esterase , characteristic of the monocyte , while continuing to proliferate and they develop hypotetraploid DNA ( 4C ) content at higher concentrations of ambient 1,25D3 than the A series cells .
Cells in the B series with 4C DNA content ( 100B and 200B ) also differed from the A series 4C cells by the absence of DNA binding by the full-length Sp1 transcription factor .
However , B series cells resembled the A series cells in exhibiting faster growth rates than the parental HL60 cells and showed high levels of vitamin D receptor and retinoid receptor X proteins .
These results show that the initial steps in the 1,25D3 signaling pathway are intact in B series resistant cells and lead to the appearance of early markers of monocytic differentiation .
However , the progression to subsequent events which comprise terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest is halted during the adaptation to the presence of 1,25D3 in these cells .
Thus , the availability of these variant cells should provide a system for studying the link between differentiation and cell cycle arrest .
The class II trans- activator ( CIITA ) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of MHC class II proteins .
Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain .
Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three alpha-helices , each with a high proportion of acidic residues .
Using site-directed mutagenesis , we found that two of these predicted alpha-helices are required for full transcriptional activation by CIITA .
Moreover , a CIITA protein in which both functional alpha-helices have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype .
This activation domain of CIITA interacts with the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID , TAFII32 .
Decreased transcriptional activation by N-terminal deletions of CIITA is correlated directly with their reduced binding to TAFII32 .
We conclude that interactions between TAFII32 and CIITA are responsible for activation of class II genes .
We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) specifically in thymic T cells .
The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity , although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development .
Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation .
When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore , the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein , CREB , and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter .
Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus , the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells .
Consequently , T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above , demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible .
Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus .
Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated , it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) is a key cytokine of T lymphocytes with major regulatory functions in the immune system .
To determine and compare protein/DNA interactions at the native IFN-gamma locus in T cells , we analyzed the human IFN-gamma promoter by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction ( LM-PCR ) techniques .
Accordingly , Jurkat T cells and primary CD45RA and CD45R0 CD4+ T cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood using immunomagnetic beads were cultured and analyzed by LM-PCR .
Constitutive and inducible protein/DNA interactions of the IFN-gamma promoter in vivo were detected in all T cells tested .
Interestingly , an inducible footprint between -183 and -196 was consistently observed in Jurkat T cells and CD45RA and CD45R0 T helper subsets upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate+phytohemagglutinin ( PMA+PHA ) that was highly sensitive to treatment with corticosteroids .
This novel target site , denoted the C-site , was shown by several criteria , including cell distribution studies , stimulation experiments , supershift assays , and cross-competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind the transcription factor AP-1 .
Mutation of the C-site that prevented AP-1 binding to this site was sufficient strikingly to reduce inducible promoter activity in primary CD45R0 T cells .
In summary , the data demonstrate that IFN-gamma gene transcription in primary T cells is regulated in vivo at the level of constitutive and inducible protein/DNA interactions .
We propose a model where basal transcription is maintained by binding of various transcription factors to the IFN-gamma promoter , whereas PMA+PHA-inducible IFN-gamma transcription in CD45R0 T cells is associated with binding of AP-1 to the C-site .
Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with Lck and down-regulates Lck-mediated activation .
We identified a novel cellular Tip-associated protein ( Tap ) by a yeast two-hybrid screen .
Tap associated with Tip following transient expression in COS-1 cells and stable expression in human Jurkat-T cells .
Expression of Tip and Tap in Jurkat-T cells induced dramatic cell aggregation .
Aggregation was likely caused by the up-regulated surface expression of adhesion molecules including integrin alpha , L-selectin , ICAM-3 , and H-CAM .
Furthermore , NF-kappaB transcriptional factor of aggregated cells had approximately 40-fold higher activity than that of parental cells .
Thus , Tap is likely to be an important cellular mediator of Tip function in T cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri .
CIITA is a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines .
Its N-terminal region is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a DNA binding domain .
We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation .
Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( TATA box binding protein ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in TBP known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors .
Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in TBP that in yeast is known to abolish VP16-mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected .
A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP-associated factor TAFII250 also failed to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain .
Certain interactions between TBP and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA-mediated transactivation to reach its full potential .
Finally , like VP16 , CIITA was able to stimulate elongation of transcription .
Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the human B-cell-specific CIITA is very similar to that mediated by the herpes virus transactivator VP16 in the ways that have been tested .
Two of the genes defective in the five complementation groups identified in the class II-negative bare lymphocyte syndrome or corresponding laboratory mutants have been cloned .
One gene encodes a protein , RFX5 , that is a member of the RFX family of DNA binding proteins .
The other , CIITA , encodes a large protein with a defined acidic transcriptional activation domain ; this protein does not interact with DNA .
Expression plasmids encoding regions of RFX5 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain activated transcription from a reporter construct containing GAL4 sites in a cotransfection assay in the Raji human B cell line .
However , these plasmids produced transcriptional activity in HeLa cells only in conjunction with interferon gamma stimulation , a condition in which expression of both CIITA and class II major histocompatibility complex surface proteins are induced.
Furthermore , these plasmids were not active in RJ2.2.5 , an in vitro mutagenized derivative of Raji in which both copies of CIITA are defective .
Transcriptional activation by the RFX5 fusion protein could be restored in RJ2.2.5 by cotransfection with a CIITA expression plasmid .
Finally , a direct interaction between RFX5 and CIITA was detected with the yeast two-hybrid and far-Western blot assays .
Thus , RFX5 can activate transcription only in cooperation with CIITA .
RFX5 and CIITA associate to form a complex capable of activating transcription from class II major histocompatibility complex promoters .
In this complex , promoter specificity is determined by the DNA binding domain of RFX5 and the general transcription apparatus is recruited by the acidic activation domain of CIITA .
This paper aims to review the role of free radical-induced tissue damage and antioxidant defence mechanisms in inflammatory diseases that involve pathogenic processes similar to the periodontal diseases .
There is a clearly defined and substantial role for free radicals or reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in periodontitis , but little research has been performed in this area .
This paper reviews the considerable data available relating ROS activity and antioxidant defence to inflammatory diseases and attempts to draw parallels with periodontitis , in an effort to stimulate more periodontal research in this important area .
The recent discovery of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is reviewed and several potential pathways for cytokine-induced periodontal tissue damage , mediated by NF-kappa B1 are discussed .
Emphasis is placed on cytokines that have been studied in periodontitis , principally TNF-alpha , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 and beta-interferon .
The link between cellular production of such important mediators of inflammation and the antioxidant ( AO ) thiols , cysteine and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , is discussed and it is hypothesised that NF-kappa B antagonists may offer important therapeutic benefits .
Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific transcription factor that belongs to the ETS protein family .
It can bind to DNA target sequences within a variety of cytokine genes .
We demonstrate that Elf-1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus which is dependent on the presence of amino acids 86-265 .
Analysis of Gal4-Elf-1 fusion proteins revealed that the N-terminal 86 amino acids of Elf-1 contain a transcriptional activation domain , the activity of which is attenuated by an internal repression domain .
Furthermore , Elf-1 interacts specifically with the E74 target sequence and can stimulate transcription driven by the E74 site independent of mitogenic signaling .
Thus , Elf-1 is able to stimulate gene transcription which may be required for the development and activity of lymphocytes .
Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) is a vasculitic syndrome that preferentially affects medium and large-sized arteries .
Glucocorticoid therapy resolves clinical symptoms within hours to days , but therapy has to be continued over several years to prevent disease relapses .
It is not known whether and how glucocorticoids affect the function of the inflammatory infiltrate or why the disease persists subclinically despite chronic treatment .
GCA is self-sustained in temporal arteries engrafted into SCID mice , providing a model in which the mechanisms of action and limitations of glucocorticoid therapy can be examined in vivo .
Administration of dexamethasone to temporal artery-SCID chimeras for 1 wk induced a partial suppression of T cell and macrophage function as indicated by the reduced tissue concentrations of IL-2 , IL-1beta , and IL-6 mRNA , and by the diminished expression of inducible NO synthase .
In contrast , synthesis of IFN-gamma mRNA was only slightly decreased , and expression of TGF-beta1 was unaffected .
These findings correlated with activation of the IkappaBalpha gene and blockade of the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB in the xenotransplanted tissue .
Dose-response experiments suggested that steroid doses currently used in clinical medicine are suboptimal in repressing NFkappaB-mediated cytokine production in the inflammatory lesions .
Chronic steroid therapy was able to deplete the T cell products IL-2 and IFN-gamma , whereas the activation of tissue-infiltrating macrophages was only partially affected .
IL-1beta transcription was abrogated ; in contrast , TGF-beta1 mRNA synthesis was steroid resistant .
The persistence of TGF-beta1-transcribing macrophages , despite paralysis of T cell function , may provide an explanation for the chronicity of the disease , and may identify a novel therapeutic target in this inflammatory vasculopathy .
Regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene expression is controlled by a B cell-specific promoter , intronic enhancer and additional B cell-specific enhancer elements identified recently in the 3' end of the IgH locus .
One of the latter elements , the IgH 3' enhancer , is of particular interest : ( 1 ) it is B cell-specific and active only in late B cell development ; ( 2 ) in rodent plasmacytomas and in some human Burkitt 's lymphomas it is part of a locus control region ( LCR ) that is involved in deregulation of the c-myc oncogene as a result of translocation into the IgH locus ; and ( 3 ) it has been implicated in the mechanisms that control Ig gene class switch recombination .
We have used a somatic cell hybridization approach to genetically analyse regulation of the activity of the IgH 3' enhancer .
When mouse MPC11 plasmacytoma cells , in which the IgH 3' enhancer is active , are fused with fibroblasts , Ig expression is extinguished at the level of transcription .
Here we show that in a MPC11 plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment , the IgH 3' enhancer is transcriptionally inactive .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that binding of several B cell-specific transcription factors , essential for IgH 3' enhancer activity , is lacking , which may explain 3' enhancer inactivity , although the binding of repressors can not be excluded .
Moreover , the high expression level of c-myc , characteristic of the parental MPC11 cells carrying the t(12;15) translocation , is down-regulated in the hybrids to that in unfused fibroblasts .
Therefore , inactivation of the IgH 3' enhancer is a multifactorial process affecting several transcription factors that control the cell-specific and developmental activity of the enhancer .
The common gamma-chain ( gamma(c) ) is a functional component of the IL-4R , yet cells lacking gamma(c) are able to respond to IL-4 .
This has led to the suggestion that a surrogate gamma'-chain , which can interact with the IL-4R alpha chain to mediate signaling , is expressed on cells lacking gamma(c) .
An alternative possibility is that in the absence of gamma(c) , the IL-4R alpha chain is able to transduce signals by homodimerization .
To test this latter possibility , a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of c-kit ( the stem cell factor ( SCF ) receptor ) and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IL-4R alpha chain was generated .
Treatment of cells expressing the chimeric receptor kit/IL-4R alpha with SCF induces activation of the IL-4R alpha-associated kinase JAK-1 and the transcription factor STAT6 .
However , tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-3 , which associates with gamma(c) , is not induced by SCF in these cells .
SCF-mediated ligation of kit/IL-4R alpha is sufficient to elicit IL-4-specific gene expression , including up-regulation of CD23 and synthesis of germ-line epsilon transcripts .
In the T cell line CTLL2 , ligation of kit/IL-4R alpha induces cellular proliferation .
Finally , in JAK-1-deficient HeLa cells , STAT6 activation by IL-4 is completely abolished .
Together , these data demonstrate that the IL-4R alpha cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to activate JAK-1 and STAT6 and to induce expression of IL-4 target genes , thus identifying a mechanism by which IL-4 signaling can proceed in the absence of JAK-3 and gamma(c) .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) is a potent monocyte regulatory cytokine that inhibits gene expression of proinflammatory mediators .
In this study , we investigated the mechanism by which IL-10 downregulates expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) on the cell surface of normal human monocytes activated with interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 expression was apparent as early as 3 hours and was blocked by an anti-IL-10 antibody but not by an isotype-matched control antibody .
Northern blot analysis showed that IL-10 reduced the accumulation of ICAM-1 mRNA in IFN-gamma-stimulated monocytes .
IL-10 inhibition of ICAM-1 steady-state mRNA was detected at 3 hours and remained at 24 hours .
Nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that IL-10 inhibited the rate of IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene , and mRNA stability studies showed that IL-10 did not alter the half-life of IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 message .
Thus , IL-10 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 expression in monocytes primarily at the level of gene transcription .
Activation of IFN-gamma-responsive genes requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor STAT-1alpha ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-1alpha ) .
However , IL-10 did not affect IFN-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1alpha or alter STAT-1alpha binding to the IFN-gamma response element ( IRE ) in the ICAM-1 promoter .
Instead , IL-10 prevented IFN-gamma-induced binding activity at the NF-kappaB site of the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -responsive NF-kappaB/C-EBP composite element in the ICAM-1 promoter .
These data indicate that IL-10 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene by a regulatory mechanism that may involve NF-kappaB .
Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) and Jak ( Janus kinases ) proteins are central components in the signal transduction events in hematopoietic and epithelial cells .
They are rapidly activated by various cytokines , hormones , and growth factors .
Upon ligand binding and cytokine receptor dimerization , Stat proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by Jak kinases .
Activated Stat proteins form homo- or heterodimers , translocate to the nucleus , and induce transcription from responsive genes .
Stat5 and Stat6 are transcription factors active in mammary epithelial cells and immune cells .
Prolactin activates Stat5 , and interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) activates Stat6 .
Both cytokines are able to stimulate cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival .
We investigated the transactivation potential of Stat6 and found that it is not restricted to lymphocytes .
IL-4-dependent activation of Stat6 was also observed in HC11 mammary epithelial cells .
In these cells , Stat6 activation led to the induction of the beta-casein gene promoter .
The induction of this promoter was confirmed in COS7 cells .
The glucocorticoid receptor was able to further enhance IL-4-induced gene transcription through the action of Stat6 .
Deletion analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat6 and recombination of this region with a heterologous DNA binding domain allowed the delimitation and characterization of the transactivation domain of Stat6 .
The potencies of the transactivation domains of Stat5 , Stat6 , and viral protein VP16 were compared .
Stat6 had a transactivation domain which was about 10-fold stronger than that of Stat5 .
In pre-B cells ( Ba/F3 ) , the transactivation domain of Stat6 was IL-4 regulated , independently from its DNA binding function .
Reactive oxygen species are involved in signal transduction pathways leading to nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation which has been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription .
We recently reported that a garlic compound , S-allyl cysteine ( SAC ) , protects bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells from oxidant injury induced by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) .
In this study we determined the effects of SAC on NF-kappa B activation in human T lymphocytes ( Jurkat cells ) induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- alpha ) and H2O2 .
Activated NF-kappa B in nuclear extracts was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled probe .
SAC consistently exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B activation induced by both TNF-alpha and H2O2 .
Supershift with specific antibodies to NF-kappa B subunits confirmed that the inducible retarded bands observed in the EMSA and p65-p50 heterodimer of the NF-kappa B/Rel protein .
Our data suggest that SAC may act via antioxidant mechanisms to block NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat cells .
An increasing body of evidence suggests that amyloid-beta ( A beta ) peptides and microglia are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .
In an effort to further elucidate the biological effects of A beta towards microglia , we investigated the ability of A beta peptides to activate nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B in the N9 murine microglial cell line .
Co-stimulation of microglia with suboptimal concentrations of A beta ( 25-35 ) and 100 U/ml IFN gamma resulted in the detection of a specific NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel mobility shift assays .
This response required at least 120 min to be evident and supershift experiments revealed that the NF-kappa B complex contains both RelA and p50 .
Accordingly , immunoblot experiments showed that amongst NF-kappa B/Rel proteins , RelA and p50 are mobilized to the nucleus following microglial cell stimulation with A beta ( 25-35 ) plus IFN gamma .
Higher concentrations of A beta ( 25-35 ) were effective by themselves in inducing NF-kappa B activation , both in the N9 microglial cell line and in rat primary microglia , as well as in human monocytes .
For purposes of comparison , microglia were also stimulated with bacterial LPS , a known NF-kappa B inducer .
As expected , LPS strongly induced the formation of two NF-kappa B DNA-binding activities , one of which was identified as RelA/p50 .
The LPS response was also more rapid , as it was already evident by 40 min and remained sustained for up to 3 h .
Collectively , these findings indicate that NF-kappa B activation might constitute one of the mechanisms underlying the inducible expression of kappa B-dependent genes in microglia stimulated by A beta peptides and IFN gamma , or by LPS .
That the signal transduction pathways used by the cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 are identical would suggest that these cytokines have redundant roles in lymphoid development ; instead , IL-2 is the guardian of thymus-derived T-cell homeostasis , while interleukin-15 promotes extrathymic development of T and NK cells .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) regulates differentiation , survival , and proliferation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells .
The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as alpha and beta subunits .
We have demonstrated that the murine FDC-P1-derived cell line WT-19 transfected with the human GM-CSF receptor alpha and beta subunits ( GM-CSFRalpha and beta ) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of human GM-CSF ( hGM-CSF ) .
By expressing a series of GM-CSFRalpha mutants in WT19 cells , we have determined the amino acid domains of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain that regulate cell differentiation , proliferation , and survival .
We found that the membrane proximal proline-rich domain and adjacent 16 residues are essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation .
In contrast , the C-terminal region of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by hGM-CSF , but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of hGM-CSF to support cell survival .
While the activation of JAK2 , Shc , Erk , and STAT5 proteins correlated with hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth , cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways .
The hypercalcemia of various granulomatoses is caused by endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1,25-(OH)2D3 ] overproduction by disease-activated macrophages .
The inability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to suppress its synthesis in macrophages contrasts with the tight control of its production in macrophage precursors , peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) .
We examined whether 1,25(OH)2D3 resistance develops as PBM differentiate to macrophages or with macrophage activation .
Normal human pulmonary alveolar macrophages ( PAM ) are less sensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3 than PBM , despite similar vitamin D receptor content ; however , both PBM and PAM respond to exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 by inhibiting 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis and inducing 1,25(OH)2D3 degradation through enhancement of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels and activity .
The human monocytic cell line THP-1 mimics PAM in 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis and sensitivity to exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 .
We utilized THP-1 cells to examine the response to 1,25(OH)2D3 with macrophage activation .
Activation of THP-1 cells with gamma-interferon ( gamma-IFN ) enhances 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis 30-fold , blocks 1,25-(OH)2D3 suppression of its synthesis , and reduces by 42.2 % 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of its degradation .
The antagonistic effects of gamma-IFN are not merely restricted to enzymatic activities .
In THP-1 cells and in normal PBM , gamma-IFN inhibits 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels without reducing mRNA stability , suggesting gamma-IFN inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D3 transactivating function .
These results explain 1,25(OH)2D3 overproduction in granulomatoses and demonstrate potent inhibition by gamma-IFN of 1,25(OH)2D3 action in immune cells .
During 15 days of treatment of K562 cells with sodium phenylacetate , we observed an increase in the cellular hemoglobin concentration with a similar increase in the expression of gamma-globin mRNA .
Morphological studies demonstrated characteristic features of erythroid differentiation and maturation .
At the same time there was no change in the level of expression of the cell surface antigenes CD33 , CD34 , CD45 , CD71 and glycophorin A .
Likewise , the level of expression of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 , GATA-2 , NF-E2 , SCL and RBTN2 , all expressed in untreated K562 cells , did not increase during sodium phenylacetate induced erythroid differentiation .
The expression of the nuclear factors Evi-1 and c-myb , known to inhibit erythroid differentiation , did not decrease .
We conclude that sodium phenylacetate treatment of K562 cells increases gamma-globin mRNA and induces cell maturation as judged by morphology without affecting the expression of the erythroid transcription factors , some of which are known to be involved in the regulation of beta-like globin genes .
Glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) are ubiquitous molecules and are present also in the hippocampus and in several other nervous and immune tissues .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) are a good model for studies of GR in humans .
Glucocorticoids are important for maintaining cellular and humoral homeostasis and are key mediators of neuroendocrine-immune regulatory interactions .
The increase of cortisol is immunosuppressive and reduces GR concentration both in nervous and immune systems .
Variation of glucocorticoids in healthy aged subjects and athletes has been shown .
Prompted by these results , we have investigated in man a possible relationship between GR binding capacity in the PBMCs and age , in relation also to plasma testosterone and cortisol .
The same parameters have been examined in a group of soccer players for comparison with the sedentary group .
GR binding capacity was higher in younger subjects than in older ones , and lower in the group of athletes than in the younger and older sedentary subjects .
In the sedentary group a negative correlation was present between GR binding capacity and age .
Plasma cortisol was higher and testosterone lower in the athletes ; they were negatively correlated in athletes and positively correlated in the sedentary subjects .
The results for athletes agree with their lower anabolic/catabolic balance .
The mechanism of reduced GR levels in relation to age and sport activity could involve a loss or an involution of receptor synthesis .
However other possibilities , such as altered distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations with different receptor concentrations and with different cytokine production , can not be excluded .
Several neuroendocrine-immune interactions could be responsible for reduced GR levels with age and sport activity in man .
IFN signaling is mediated by binding of IFNs to their receptors and subsequent activation of Janus tyrosine kinase ( JAK ) -STAT signaling pathway .
Stimulation of cells with IFN-alpha leads to the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription factor complex formed by STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 protein .
IFN-gamma signaling is mediated by homodimeric STAT1 protein .
Although these signaling molecules are expressed constitutively , there is also evidence of transcriptional regulation by IFNs .
We have characterized the expression of STAT and IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family transcription factors in primary human blood mononuclear cells and macrophages in response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation .
We show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma rapidly and efficiently enhanced STAT1 , STAT2 , p48 , and IRF-1 gene expression .
IFN-gamma induced IRF-1 gene expression more strongly than IFN-alpha .
Stimulation experiments in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , suggested that these genes were activated directly by IFNs .
IRF-2 gene was apparently only weakly responsive to IFNs in these cells .
When macrophages were pretreated with low doses of IFN-gamma and then stimulated with IFN-alpha , clearly enhanced formation of specific transcription factor complexes was detected .
This suggests that higher intracellular levels of STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 protein may result in enhanced signal transduction for cytokines utilizing these transcription factors .
It is known that the expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) in adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) cells are high , whereas those in T-lymphoid cells are not .
In order to investigate the factors that influence the induction of ICAM-1 molecules , Northern blot analysis to measure the expression level of ICAM-1 mRNAs and Southern blot hybridization to analyze the integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) provirus were done .
The levels of ICAM-1 mRNA expression of ATL cells were generally higher than those of T-lymphoid cells .
However , ILT-mat cells and ATL16T(-) cells , although they were ATL cells , showed rather low surface ICAM-1 expression and ICAM-1 mRNA expression .
Southern blot hybridization showed that only two and four bands were found in ILT-mat and ATL16T(-) cells , respectively , whereas > 10 bands were detected in other ATL cells .
These results suggest that monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus to the genome of T cell , especially the number of integration sites , is one of the factors for induction of ICAM-1 molecules .
When transcriptionally active , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter contains a nucleosome-free region encompassing both the promoter/enhancer region and a large region ( 255 nucleotides [ nt ] ) downstream of the transcription start site .
We have previously identified new binding sites for transcription factors downstream of the transcription start site ( nt 465 to 720 ) : three AP-1 sites ( I , II , and III ) , an AP3-like motif ( AP3-L ) , a downstream binding factor ( DBF ) site , and juxtaposed Sp1 sites .
Here , we show that the DBF site is an interferon-responsive factor ( IRF ) binding site and that the AP3-L motif binds the T-cell-specific factor NF-AT .
Mutations that abolish the binding of each factor to its cognate site are introduced in an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone to study their effect on HIV-1 transcription and replication .
Individual mutation of the DBF or AP3-L site as well as the double mutation AP-1(III)/AP3-L did not affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus .
In contrast , proviruses carrying mutations in the Sp1 sites were totally defective in terms of replication .
Virus production occurred with slightly delayed kinetics for viruses containing combined mutations in the AP-1(III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites and in the AP3-L and DBF-sites , whereas viruses mutated in the AP-1(I,II,III) and AP3-L sites and in the AP-1(I,II,III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites exhibited a severely defective replicative phenotype .
No RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA .
Measurement of the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter after transient transfection of the HIV-1 provirus DNA or of long terminal repeat-luciferase constructs showed a positive correlation between the transcriptional and the replication defects for most mutants .
Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a critical transcription factor for maximal expression of many cytokines that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases , such as adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and sepsis syndrome .
Activation and regulation of NF-kappa B are tightly controlled by a group of inhibitory proteins ( I kappa B ) that sequester NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm of immune/inflammatory effector cells .
NF-kappa B activation involves signaled phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteolysis of I kappa B .
Liberated NF-kappa B migrates to the nucleus , where it binds to specific promoter sites and activates gene transcription .
The activation of NF-kappa B initiates both extracellular and intracellular regulatory events that result in autoregulation of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-kappa B activation .
Recently , activation of NF-kappa B has been linked to ARDS and has been shown to be a critical proximal step in the initiation of neutrophilic inflammation in animal models .
Activation of NF-kappa B can be inhibited in vivo by treatment with antioxidants , corticosteroids , and the induction of endotoxin tolerance .
Identification of more specific and efficacious inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation might prove beneficial for the treatment of cytokine-mediated inflammatory diseases .
The genes encoding the functionally related hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha play a critical role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function .
Mutations in these liver-enriched transcription factors result in two forms of early-onset type 2 diabetes ( maturity-onset diabetes of the young [ MODY ] ) , MODY3 and MODY1 , which are characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion , early disease onset , and autosomal dominant inheritance .
The transcriptional hierarchy of HNFs suggests that other proteins of the regulatory cascade might be responsible for other forms of MODY and/or late-onset type 2 diabetes .
In this study , we show that HNF-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells .
We report the identification and characterization of simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms in the genes encoding HNF-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 and the mapping of HNF-6 to chromosome bands 15q21.1-21.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
These markers will be useful to study the role of genetic variation in these genes in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes .
The Zfh family of zinc finger/homeodomain proteins was first identified in Drosophila where it is required for differentiation of tissues such as the central nervous system and muscle .
ZEB , a vertebrate homolog of Zfh-1 , binds a subset of E boxes and blocks myogenesis through transcriptional repression of muscle genes .
We present evidence here that ZEB also has an important role in controlling hematopoietic gene transcription .
Two families of transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis are c-Myb and Ets .
These factors act synergistically to activate transcription , and this synergy is required for transcription of at least several important hematopoietic genes .
ZEB blocks the activity of c-Myb and Ets individually , but together the factors synergize to resist this repression .
Such repression imposes a requirement for both c-Myb and Ets for transcriptional activity , providing one explanation for why synergy between these factors is important .
The balance between repression by ZEB and transcriptional activation by c-Myb/Ets provides a flexible regulatory mechanism for controlling gene expression in hematopoietic cells .
We demonstrate that one target of this positive/negative regulation in vivo is the alpha4 integrin , which play a key role in normal hematopoiesis and function of mature leukocytes .
The T-cell receptor ( TCR ) beta-chain promoters have been characterized as nonstructured basal promoters that carry a single conserved ubiquitous cyclic AMP-responsive element .
Our investigation of the human TCR beta gene uncovers a surprisingly complex and tissue-specific structure at the TCR Vbeta 8.1 promoter .
The core of the promoter ( positions -42 to +11 ) is recognized by the lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors Ets-1 , LEF1 , and AML1 as well as by CREB/ATF-1 , as is demonstrated in gel shift and footprinting experiments .
With the exception of LEF1 , these factors activate transcription in T cells .
Binding sites at the core region show little conservation with consensus sites .
Nonetheless , CREB , Ets-1 , and AML1 bind and activate cooperatively and very efficiently through the nonconsensus binding sites at the core promoter region .
Moderate ubiquitous activation is further induced by CREB/ATF and Sp1 factors through proximal upstream elements .
The tissue-specific core promoter structure is apparently conserved in other T-cell-specifically expressed genes such as the CD4 gene .
Our observations suggest that both the enhancer and the promoter have a complex tissue-specific structure whose functional interplay potentiates T-cell-specific transcription .
The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K protein represents a novel class of proteins that may act as docking platforms that orchestrate cross-talk among molecules involved in signal transduction and gene expression .
Using a fragment of K protein as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen , we isolated a cDNA that encodes a protein whose primary structure has extensive similarity to the Drosophila melanogaster extra sex combs ( esc ) gene product , Esc , a putative silencer of homeotic genes .
The cDNA that we isolated is identical to the cDNA of the recently positionally cloned mouse embryonic ectoderm development gene , eed .
Like Esc , Eed contains six WD-40 repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein and is thought to repress homeotic gene expression during mouse embryogenesis .
Eed binds to K protein through a domain in its N terminus , but interestingly , this domain is not found in the Drosophila Esc .
Gal4-Eed fusion protein represses transcription of a reporter gene driven by a promoter that contains Gal4-binding DNA elements .
Eed also represses transcription when recruited to a target promoter by Gal4-K protein .
Point mutations within the eed gene that are responsible for severe embryonic development abnormalities abolished the transcriptional repressor activity of Eed .
Results of this study suggest that Eed-restricted homeotic gene expression during embryogenesis reflects the action of Eed as a transcriptional repressor .
The Eed-mediated transcriptional effects are likely to reflect the interaction of Eed with multiple molecular partners , including K protein .
Fusion proteins involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) and the PML or PLZF nuclear protein are the genetic markers of acute promyelocytic leukemias ( APLs ) .
APLs with the PML-RAR alpha or the PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced differentiation : PML-RAR alpha blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment , while patients with PLZF-RAR alpha do not .
We here report that ( i ) like PML-RAR alpha expression , PLZF-RAR alpha expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines ( U937 and HL-60 ) in response to different stimuli ( vitamin D3 , transforming growth factor beta1 , and dimethyl sulfoxide ) ; ( ii ) PML-RAR alpha , but not PLZF-RAR alpha , increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells ; ( iii ) PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar RA binding affinities ; and ( iv ) PML-RAR alpha enhances the RA response of RA target genes ( those for RAR beta , RAR gamma , and transglutaminase type II [ TGase ] ) in vivo , while PLZF-RAR alpha expression has either no effect ( RAR beta ) or an inhibitory activity ( RAR gamma and type II TGase ) .
These data demonstrate that PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar ( inhibitory ) effects on RA-independent differentiation and opposite ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) effects on RA-dependent differentiation and that they behave in vivo as RA-dependent enhancers or inhibitors of RA-responsive genes , respectively .
Their different activities on the RA signalling pathway might underlie the different responses of PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha APLs to RA treatment .
The PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein contains an approximately 120-amino-acid N-terminal motif ( called the POZ domain ) , which is also found in a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of poxvirus proteins and which mediates protein-protein interactions .
Deletion of the PLZF POZ domain partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RAR alpha on RA-induced differentiation and on RA-mediated type II TGase up-regulation , suggesting that POZ-mediated protein interactions might be responsible for the inhibitory transcriptional activities of PLZF-RAR alpha .
BACKGROUND : Recent studies have raised the hypothesis that glucocorticoids could diminish the ability of endothelial cells to direct leukocyte traffic into inflamed tissues by inhibiting expression of the adhesion molecules endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 .
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether glucocorticoids also regulate the expression of L-selectin and CD11/CD18 integrins on human neutrophil granulocytes .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Incubation of human whole blood with platelet-activating factor ( PAF , 1 mumol/L ) evoked downregulation of L-selectin and upregulation of CD11/CD18 adhesion receptors on neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry .
While dexamethasone ( 0.1 nmol/L to 100 mumol/L ) did not affect expression of adhesion molecules on resting neutrophils , it attenuated the PAF-induced changes in L-selectin and CD18 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion with IC50 values of 31 and 13 nmol/L , respectively .
These effects of dexamethasone were completely aborted by RU-486 ( 10 mumol/L ) , which blocks transcriptional activation of the glucocorticoid receptor , and by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( 35.5 mumol/L ) .
Dexamethasone , up to a concentration of 1 mumol/L , neither affected significantly the release of granule enzymes nor interfered with PAF binding to its membrane receptors .
CONCLUSIONS : Our results show that glucocorticoids at clinically relevant concentrations exert specific actions on expression of adhesion molecules on activated neutrophils , which are mediated through ligation of glucocorticoid receptors and induction of protein synthesis , and suggest a novel mechanism by which anti-inflammatory corticosteroids may inhibit leukocyte accumulation .
Because candidiasis and cryptococcosis are common in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected persons , the effect of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans on HIV expression in monocytic cells was examined .
Stimulation of the latently HIV-infected myelomonocytic cell line OM-10.1 with C. neoformans and C. albicans in the presence of pooled human serum caused a ratio-dependent increase in HIV production .
Induction of HIV by C. neoformans was enhanced by anti-capsular antibody , while induction by both organisms was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody .
In THP-1 cells transfected with HIV plasmid constructs , both organisms induced transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat that was dependent on intact NF-kappaB binding sequences .
Thus , C. neoformans and C. albicans enhance HIV expression in monocytic cells through a TNF-alpha- and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism .
In HIV-infected patients , such enhancement may further impair host immunity and could accelerate the course of HIV disease .
Induction of the adaptive immune response depends on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines by antigen-presenting cells .
The mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection are poorly understood .
It has been proposed that their expression is controlled by the non-clonal , or innate , component of immunity that preceded in evolution the development of an adaptive immune system in vertebrates .
We report here the cloning and characterization of a human homologue of the Drosophila toll protein ( Toll ) which has been shown to induce the innate immune response in adult Drosophila .
Like Drosophila Toll , human Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain , and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor .
Both Drosophila Toll and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the NF-kappaB pathway .
We show that a constitutively active mutant of human Toll transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of NF-kappaB-controlled genes for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 , IL-6 and IL-8 , as well as the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 , which is required for the activation of naive T cells .
During humoral immune responses , B-lymphocyte activation is followed by differentiation along either the plasma cell pathway or the memory B-cell pathway .
Recent studies suggest that CD40-CD40 ligand , OX-OX40 ligand , a group of cytokines and intracellular transcriptional factors may all contribute to B-lymphocyte differentiation control .
Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of class I antigen induced in PBMC and highly purified T lymphocytes the nuclear activity of NF-kappa B/Rel complexes .
These included both p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers , recognized by specific antibodies in EMSA .
The induced complexes were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with anti-class I monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) for 1.5 h ; the induction was maximal at 5 h , persistent at 16 h and no longer observed at 40 h .
The mAb failed to induce NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin , an inhibitor of I kappa B-alpha degradation .
Together , these results suggest that class I triggering can induce the activity of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes , thereby modulating the expression of genes regulated by these transcription factors .
The transcription factor NF-kappa B controls the induction of numerous cytokine promoters during the activation of T lymphocytes .
Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters .
We show for human Jurkat T leukemia cells , as well as human and mouse primary T lymphocytes , that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins c-Rel , RelA/p65 and NF-kappa B1/p50 , whereas the nuclear appearance of RelB remains unaffected .
CsA does not interfere with the synthesis of Rel proteins , but prevents the inducible degradation of cytosolic NF-kappa B inhibitors I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta upon T cell activation .
CsA neither inhibits the processing of the NF-kappa B1 precursor p105 to p50 , nor does it " stabilize " the C-terminal portion of p105 , I kappa B gamma , which is degraded during p105 processing to mature p50 .
These results indicate that CsA interferes with a specific event in the signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta , but does not affect the processing of NF-kappa B1/p105 to p50 .
Some of the most potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents are synthetic glucocorticoids .
However , major side effects severely limit their therapeutic use .
The development of improved glucocorticoid-based drugs will require the separation of beneficial from deleterious effects .
One possibility toward this goal is to try to dissociate two main activities of glucocorticoids , i.e. transactivation and transrepression .
Screening of a library of compounds using transactivation and AP-1 transrepression models in transiently transfected cells identified dissociated glucocorticoids , which exert strong AP-1 inhibition but little or no transactivation .
Importantly , despite high ligand binding affinity , the prototypic dissociated compound , RU24858 , acted as a weak agonist and did not efficiently antagonize dexamethasone-induced transcription in transfected cells .
Similar results were obtained in hepatic HTC cells for the transactivation of the endogenous tyrosine amino transferase gene ( TAT ) , which encodes one of the enzymes involved in the glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of neoglucogenesis .
To investigate whether dissociated glucocorticoids retained the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive potential of classic glucocorticoids , several in vitro and in vivo models were used .
Indeed , secretion of the proinflammatory lymphokine interleukin-1beta was severely inhibited by dissociated glucocorticoids in human monocytic THP 1 cells .
Moreover , in two in vivo models , these compounds exerted an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity as potent as that of the classic glucocorticoid prednisolone .
These results may lead to an improvement of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies and provide a novel concept for drug discovery .
Interleukin-9 receptor ( IL-9R ) complex consists of a ligand-specific alpha chain and IL-2R gamma chain .
In this study , two regions in the cytoplasmic domain of human IL-9Ralpha were found to be important for IL-9-mediated cell growth .
A membrane-proximal region that contains the BOX1 consensus sequence is required for IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases ( JAKs ) .
Deletion of this region or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif abrogated IL-9-induced cell proliferation and signal transduction .
However , substitution of the Pro-X-Pro in the BOX1 motif with Ala-X-Ala failed to abolish IL-9-induced cell proliferation but decreased IL-9-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , insulin receptor substrate-2 , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and expression of c-myc and junB .
Another important region is downstream of the BOX1 motif and contains a STAT3 binding motif YLPQ .
Deletion of this region significantly impaired IL-9-induced cell growth , activation of JAK kinases , insulin receptor substrate-2 , and STAT3 and expression of early response genes .
A point mutation changing YLPQ into YLPA greatly reduced IL-9-induced activation of STAT3 and expression of c-myc but did not affect cell proliferation .
These results suggest that cooperation or cross-talk of signaling molecules associated with different domains of IL-9Ralpha other than STAT3 is essential for IL-9-mediated cell growth .
Latent infection of B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) can be disrupted by expression of the EBV ZEBRA protein .
ZEBRA , a transcriptional activator , initiates the EBV lytic cascade by activating viral gene expression .
ZEBRA is also indispensable for viral replication and binds directly to the EBV lytic origin of replication .
The studies described herein demonstrate that the activation domain .
ZEBRA activation can be replaced by a heterologous acidic , proline-rich , or glutamine-rich activation domain .
ZEBRA activation domain swap constructs retain ZEBRA 's native abilities to activate specific EBV promoters , to disrupt EBV latency , and to stimulate replication at the EBV lytic origin .
Additional work , employing sequential and internal deletions of ZEBRA 's N-terminal activation domain , indicates that its separate activities are not attributable to specific subdomains but are spread throughout its N terminus and therefore can not be inactivated by deleting localized regions .
A large amount of detailed information about the intracellular proteins regulating NF-kappa B activation and the cellular response to NF-kappa B activation has emerged recently .
Several small molecules , an antisense oligonucleotide , and gene therapeutic agents that inhibit NF-kappa b activation have been described .
Despite this , there are still significant gaps in our understanding of this process and its consequences .
In contrast , the characterization of transcription factors selectively regulating cytokine production by CD4+ T cell subsets is at a very early stage .
Three interacting proteins have recently been shown to contribute to subset-restricted expression of the IL-4 gene .
There are other elements regulating IL-4 gene expression , however , and the relative importance of these recently identified proteins has yet to be determined .
The aim of this study was to analyze the role of cholecystokinin ( CCK(B) ) receptor in human lymphoblastic Jurkat T cells .
We investigated the trophic effect resulting from activation of such a receptor by using the reporter gene strategy .
For this purpose , we transiently transfected Jurkat T cells with the reporter plasmid p [(TRE)3-tk-Luc] and found that CCK-8 was able to dose-dependently induce luciferase expression related to activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activation with a maximal response identical to that obtained with compounds known to activate AP-1 complex ( quantitatively , the same level of induction was obtained with 1 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , 100 microM diacylglycerol , or 4 nM epidermal growth factor ) .
The involvement of the CCK(B) receptor in such a stimulation was demonstrated by the inhibiting effect of the selective CCK(B) receptor antagonist PD-135,158 .
This effect was confirmed in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA of CCK(B) receptor cloned from Jurkat T cells .
To better understand the AP-1-dependent luciferase expression in Jurkat T cells , we tested two specific inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases-1 and -2A : okadaic acid and calyculin A .
These compounds strongly increased the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate response , whereas we have not observed a contribution of phosphatase inhibitors on a CCK-8-induced luciferase activity .
To confirm that CCK(B) receptors are involved in AP-1 response , we investigated the CCK-8 effect on interleukin-2 expression , a natural endogenous gene regulated by several factors , including AP-1 .
In Jurkat T cells activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin , CCK-8 induced IL-2 expression .
This induction was abolished by PD-135,158 .
Our results indicate that CCK-8 exerts a trophic effect in Jurkat T cells through stimulation of CCK(B) receptors by modulation of expression of AP-1-regulated genes .
Phagocytosis represents an important physiological trigger for the inducible expression of several genes in human neutrophils .
Here , we report that a DNA-binding activity primarily consisting of the classical NF-kappa B heterodimer , p50/RelA , is induced in phagocytosing neutrophils .
Under these conditions , NF-kappa B activation was found to be a rapid and transient response , reaching a maximum by 10-15 min , and returning to near-basal levels by 30 min .
In neutrophils undergoing the phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts , the onset of NF-kappa B activation was paralleled by a decline in immunoreactive I kappa B-alpha protein levels , and the cellular I kappa B-alpha pool was replenished by 30 min , in agreement with our gel shift data .
We conclude that NF-kappa B activation could constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of kappa B-responsive genes is enhanced in phagocytosing neutrophils .
To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that phagocytic stimuli can induce NF-kappa B activation in human neutrophils .
The expression of many genes for which products are involved in inflammation is controlled by the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B .
Because surfactant protein ( SP ) A is involved in local host defense in the lung and alters immune cell function by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as surface proteins involved in inflammation , we hypothesized that SP-A exerts its action , at least in part , via activation of NF-kappa B .
We used gel shift assays to determine whether SP-A activated NF-kappa B in the THP-1 cell line , a human monocytic cell line .
Activation of NF-kappa B in THP-1 cells by SP-A doses as low as 1 microgram/ml occurred within 30 min of SP-A treatment , peaked at 60 min , and then declined .
This activation is inhibited by known inhibitors of NF-kappa B or by simultaneous treatment of the cells with surfactant lipids .
Moreover , the NF-kappa B inhibitors blocked SP-A-dependent increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels .
These observations suggest a mechanism by which SP-A plays a role in the pathogenesis of some lung conditions and point to potential therapeutic measures that could be used to prevent SP-A induced inflammation in the lung .
The adherence of monocytes to activated endothelium is an early event in atherogenesis .
Because antioxidants have been considered to be of antiatherosclerotic potential , we investigated the effects of alpha-tocopherol ( TCP ) and its acetate and succinate esters on monocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) .
Endothelial cells were treated with TCP , alpha-tocopherol acetate ( TCP acetate ) , or alpha-tocopheryl succinate ( TCP succinate ) before stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) or interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) .
Cytokine-stimulated cell surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 , CD106 ) and E-selectin ( ELAM-1 , CD62E ) , but not of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) , was time- and dose- dependently inhibited by TCP succinate but not by TCP or TCP acetate .
TCP succinate ( 200 microM , 24 h ) reduced TNF-induced VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression from a specific mean fluorescence intensity of 151 +/- 28 to 12 +/- 4 channels and from 225 +/- 38 to 79 +/- 21 channels , respectively .
Succinate alone had no effect .
Decreased adhesion molecule expression was associated with a reduction of monocytic cell adhesion .
TCP succinate ( 20 microM , 72 h ) , but not TCP ( 200 microM , 72 h ) , reduced U-937 cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated ( 10 U/ml , 6 h ) HUVEC by 30 % ( P < 0.025 ) and to IL-1 beta-stimulated HUVEC by 56 % ( P < 0.010 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of HUVEC nuclear proteins revealed a decrease in TNF-alpha-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation after pretreatment of HUVEC with TCP succinate but not with TCP , TCP acetate , or succinate alone .
In conclusion , we demonstrate that the vitamin E derivative TCP succinate prevents monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappa B , further emphasizing the antiatherosclerotic potential of lipid soluble antioxidants .
Leukocyte integrins are fundamentally important in modulating adhesion to extracellular matrix components and to other cells .
This integrin-mediated adhesion controls leukocyte arrest and extravasation during the onset of inflammatory responses .
Moreover , integrin-ligand interactions trigger signaling pathways that may influence leukocyte phenotype and function at sites of inflammation .
In the current studies , we evaluated the combinatorial effects of monocyte adhesion and IFN-gamma on intracellular signaling pathways .
IFN-gamma triggers a well-defined signal transduction pathway , which although not directly stimulated by monocyte adherence to fibronectin or arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) -coated substrata , was enhanced significantly in these matrix-adherent cells .
Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces , monocytes adherent to fibronectin or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of IFN-gamma-induced mRNA for the high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor .
By electrophoretic mobility shift assays , this increase in mRNA was associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the STAT1-containing DNA-binding complex that binds to Fc gammaRI promoter elements .
Furthermore , the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 was enhanced significantly in RGD-adherent monocytes compared with control cells .
These results suggest a novel mechanism by which integrin-mediated cell adhesion can modulate the magnitude of cytokine-induced signal transduction pathways , thereby amplifying cellular events leading to monocyte activation and inflammation .
Mutations in the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3 are responsible for approximately 50 % of familial tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ) .
The gene has 41 small exons spanning 45 kb of genomic DNA and encoding a 5.5 kb mRNA .
Large germline deletions of TSC2 occur in < 5 % of cases , and a number of small intragenic mutations have been described .
We analysed mRNA from 18 unrelated cases of TSC for TSC2 mutations using the protein truncation test ( PTT ) .
Three cases were predicted to be TSC2 mutations on the basis of linkage analysis or because a hamartoma from the patient showed loss of heterozygosity for 16p13.3 markers .
Three overlapping PCR products , covering the complete coding sequence of mRNA , were generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines , translated into 35S-methionine labelled protein , and analysed by SDS-PAGE .
PCR products showing PTT shifts were directly sequenced , and mutations confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion where possible .
Six PTT shifts were identified .
Five of these were caused by mutations predicted to produce a truncated protein : ( i ) a sporadic case showed a 32 bp deletion in exon 11 , and a mutant mRNA without exon 11 was produced ; the normal exon 10 was also spliced out ; ( ii ) a sporadic case had a 1 bp deletion in exon 12 ( 1634delT ) ; ( iii ) a TSC2-linked mother and daughter pair had a G --> T transversion in exon 23 ( G2715T ) introducing a cryptic splice site causing a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 23 ; ( iv ) a sporadic case showed a 2 bp deletion in exon 36 ; ( v ) a sporadic case showed a 1 bp insertion disrupting the donor splice site of exon 37 ( 5007+2insA ) , resulting in the use of an upstream exonic cryptic splice site to cause a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 37 .
In one case , the PTT shift was explained by in-frame splicing out of exon 10 , in the presence of a normal exon 10 genomic sequence .
Alternative splicing of exon 10 of the TSC2 gene may be a normal variant .
Three 3rd base substitution polymorphisms were also detected during direct sequencing of PCR products .
Confirmed mutations were identified in 28 % of the families studied and on the assumption that half of the sporadic cases should have TSC2 mutations , a crude estimate of the detection rate would be 60 % .
This compares favourably with other screening methods used for TSC2 , notably SSCP , and since PTT involves much less work it may be the method of choice .
The leukocyte integrin genes CD11c and CD11b are expressed predominately in myelomonocytic cells .
In previous experiments , the -70 to -65 and -121 to -103 regions of the CD11c promoter and the -66 to -59 region of the CD11b promoter were shown to be essential for Sp1- mediated activation of these genes .
In vivo genomic footprinting had also revealed cell-specific binding of protein , presumably Sp1 , to these regions .
In this study , electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that the Sp1-related factor , Sp3 , also binds at or near these same regions .
Cotransfection of Sp3 along with CD11c promoter-luciferase constructs into Sp-deficient Drosophila Schneider 2 cells showed that Sp3 could activate the CD11c promoter .
Deletion of both the -70 to -65 and -121 to -103 regions of the CD11c promoter resulted in the loss of activation by Sp3 .
Both sites showed activation by Sp3 ; however , the -70 to -65 region was more responsive to Sp3 than to Sp1 .
Similar transfection analysis of the -66 to -59 region of the CD11b promoter showed Sp3-dependent expression .
Further , cotransfection analysis in Drosophila cells showed that Sp3 , as was previously shown for Sp1 , also synergizes with c-Jun to activate CD11c .
Antisense experiments that knocked out endogenous Sp3 expression in the myelomocytic cell line , HL60 , revealed that Sp3 participates in activation of the CD11c and CD11b promoters in vivo .
Eotaxin is an eosinophil specific beta-chemokine assumed to be involved in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis , allergic rhinitis , asthma and parasitic infections .
Its expression is stimulus- and cell-specific .
We here describe the genomic organisation ( 3 exons of 132 , 112 and 542 bp and 2 introns of 1211 and 378 bp ) and sequence including 3 kb of DNA from the immediate 5' upstream region of the human eotaxin gene .
Among the regulatory promoter elements potentially regulating eotaxin gene expression and/or mediating the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs we identified consensus sequences known to interact with nuclear factors like NF-IL6 , AP-1 , a NF-kappa-B like consensus sequence and gamma-interferon- as well as glucocorticoid response elements .
The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate unwanted cells from a wide variety of organisms .
Various extracellular signals , often converging in common intracellular pathways , can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion .
Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors regulate apoptosis in many cell types .
In most cells , Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis ; however , under some circumstances , activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis .
Rel/NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that consists of multiple polypeptide subunits , and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve protein-protein interactions , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , proteolytic degradation , and nucleocytoplasmic translocation .
The sophisticated control of Rel/NF-kappa B activity is not surprising since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion .
Thus , it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens , which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel/NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication , cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses .
This review will cover the molecular mechanisms that are utilized by mammalian oncogenic viruses to affect the activity of Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors and the role of Rel/NF-kappa B in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication .
Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 3 and 5 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
We now show that IL-2 regulation of STAT3 proteins in T cells is a complex response involving activation of two forms of STAT3 : 90-kDa STAT3alpha and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3beta .
The phosphorylation of STAT proteins on serine residues is also required for competent STAT transcription .
A critical serine phosphorylation site in STAT3alpha is at position 727 .
In this study we have produced an antisera specific for STAT3alpha proteins phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation .
Our results show that phosphorylation of STAT3alpha on serine 727 is not constitutive in quiescent T cells but can be induced by the cytokine IL-2 .
Interestingly , triggering of the T cell antigen receptor complex or activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding .
Hence , the present results show that STAT3 serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule .
IL-2 and T cell antigen receptor complex induction of STAT3alpha serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the MEK/ERK pathway .
Previous studies have identified H-7-sensitive kinase pathways that regulate STAT3 DNA binding .
We show that H-7-sensitive pathways regulate STAT3 DNA binding in T cells .
Nevertheless , we show that H-7-sensitive kinases do not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 .
These results thus show that STAT3 proteins are targets for multiple kinase pathways in T cells and can integrate signals from both cytokine receptors and antigen receptors .
1 . In this study we hypothesized that in individuals with certain genetic makeup , MTBE , benzene or their metabolites act as adducts and may induce programmed cell death .
2 . Our study involved a group of 60 male and female subjects who were exposed to MTBE and benzene-contaminated water concentrations up to 76 PPB for MTBE and 14 PPB for benzene , for a period of 5 to 8 years .
For comparison , we recruited a control group consisting of 32 healthy males and females with similar age distribution and without a history of exposure to MTBE or benzene .
3 . Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) of both groups were tested for the percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle progression using flow cytometry .
4 . When apoptotic lymphocytes from exposed individuals were compared to apoptotic lymphocytes from the control group , statistically-significant differences between each mean group were detected ( 26.4 +/- 1.8 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 , respectively ) , indicating an increased rate of apoptosis in 80.5 % of exposed individuals ( P < 0.0001 , Mann-Whitney U-Test ) .
MTBE and benzene-induced apoptosis is attributed to a discrete block within the cell cycle progression .
Because cell cycle analysis showed that in PBL from chemically-exposed individuals , between 20-50 % of cells were accumulated at the S-G2/M boundaries .
5 . One of the signaling molecules which mediates programmed cell death is nuclear factor Kappa-B ( NF-kappa B ) .
NF-kappa B was examined as one of the many molecular mechanisms for mediating cell death by MTBE and benzene .
Indeed , addition of inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , to the lymphocytes of the chemically-exposed group was capable of inhibiting programmed cell death by 40 % .
This reversal of apoptosis almost to the control level by inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation may indicate involvement of this signaling molecule in MTBE and benzene induction of programmed cell death .
Acute ethanol exposure has the capacity to modulate immune functions , particularly , to down regulate monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines .
However , the intracellular mechanisms for these effects of ethanol are yet to be understood .
Considering that nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel is a common regulatory element of the promoter region of the inflammatory cytokine genes , herein , we tested the hypothesis that acute ethanol affects NF-kappa B activation in human monocytes .
Adherence-isolated monocytes showed constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B .
A clinically relevant dose ( 25 mM ) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased NF-kappa B binding activity in monocytes with a preferential induction of the inhibitory , p50/p50 , NF-kappa B/Rel homodimer , and resulted in no induction of the p65/p50 heterodimer .
In contrast , lipopolysaccharide stimulation primarily induced the p65/p50 heterodimer that has been shown to result in gene activation .
Thus , such unique activation of the inhibitory p50/p50 homodimer by acute ethanol treatment may result in inhibition rather than activation of NF-kappa B-regulated inflammatory cytokine genes .
Consequently , these results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol may affect production of inflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1 beta , and interleukin-6 by disrupting NF-kappa B signaling in monocytes .
Bcl-6 protein is a recently identified novel transcription factor whose deregulated expression is associated with diffuse large B cell lymphomas .
It was recently shown by us that the protein is located in germinal center B cells and their neoplastic counterparts .
In the present study , the expression of bcl-6 protein on normal epidermis , benign , and malignant tumors originating from epidermal cells , and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines are investigated .
With the use of immunohistochemistry , bcl-6 protein was shown to stain intensely on normal prickle cells , but none to only slightly on epidermal basal cells .
Papillomas and keratoacanthomas copied their normal counterparts in the mode of expression .
Various levels of expression were found on seborrheic keratoses , while the expression level on basal cell epitheliomas was low .
Peculiarly , eccrine poromas and undifferentiated spindle-shaped basal cell epitheliomas were totally unstained .
Squamous cell carcinomas showed a variety of expression levels , while two undifferentiated spindle-shaped carcinomas and one undifferentiated SCC cell line remained unstained .
These results suggest that the expression of bcl-6 protein may be associated with morphological differentiation in normal and neoplastic epidermal cells .
The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas-mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease .
To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2 , as an anti-apoptosis protein .
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti-Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis .
In addition , BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells .
The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL .
Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32 , but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors .
A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas- induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .
Surprisingly , expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bcl-2 in a B-cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells .
Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .
Activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor ( NF-AT ) is a key event underlying lymphocyte action .
The CAML ( calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand ) protein is a coinducer of NF-AT activation when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells .
A member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily was isolated by virtue of its affinity for CAML .
Cross-linking of this lymphocyte-specific protein , designated TACI ( transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor ) , on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells with TACI-specific antibodies led to activation of the transcription factors NF-AT , AP-1 , and NFkappaB .
TACI-induced activation of NF-AT was specifically blocked by a dominant-negative CAML mutant , thus implicating CAML as a signaling intermediate .
Cyclosporine ( CsA ) is both a clinical immunosuppressive drug and a probe to dissect intracellular signaling pathways .
In vitro , CsA inhibits lymphocyte gene activation by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin ( CN ) .
In clinical use , CsA treatment inhibits 50-75 % of CN activity in circulating leukocytes .
We modeled this degree of CN inhibition in primary human leukocytes in vitro in order to study the effect of partial CN inhibition on the downstream signaling events that lead to gene activation .
In CsA-treated leukocytes stimulated by calcium ionophore , the degree of reduction in CN activity was accompanied by a similar degree of inhibition of each event tested : dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins , nuclear DNA binding , activation of a transfected reporter gene construct , IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA accumulation , and IFN-gamma production .
Furthermore , the degree of CN inhibition was reflected by a similar degree of reduction in lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-gamma production in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures .
These data support the conclusion that CN activity is rate-limiting for the activation of primary human T lymphocytes .
Thus , the reduction of CN activity observed in CsA-treated patients is accompanied by a similar degree of reduction in lymphocyte gene activation , and accounts for the immunosuppression observed .
Ig heavy chain class switching is directed by cytokines inducing transcription from unrearranged CH genes .
Subsequently , such primed cells can undergo switch recombination to express the selected new isotype .
In the case of IgE class switching , IL-4 activates the IgE germline promoter by inducing the interaction of the transcription factor STAT6 ( IL-4STAT ) with a responsive DNA element in the proximal region of the promoter .
This study describes the characterization of two additional cis-acting elements that interact with members of the NF kappa B/rel transcription factor family in an IL-4-independent fashion .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that the nucleoprotein complex formed on the upstream site ( NF kappa B1 ) contains the classical p50/p65 heterodimer .
The complex on the proximal site ( NF kappa B2 ) appears to be composed of p50 and relB .
IgE germline promoter reporter gene constructs carrying point mutations in the NF kappa B2 site were largely unresponsive to IL-4 stimulation in transient transfection experiments , while plasmids with similar mutations in the NF kappa B1 site responded to cytokine stimulation better than the wild-type promoter .
The NF kappa B2 effect was dependent on the presence of the STAT6 binding site , demonstrating that the NF kappa B2 motif is necessary but not sufficient for mediating cytokine up-regulation .
In addition , the combination of a NF kappa B/rel binding site and the STAT6 response element conferred IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous minimal promoter , while the individual sites had no effect .
The available data suggest that the NF kappa B2 nucleoprotein complex may cooperate with DNA-bound STAT6 to achieve IL-4-dependent activation of the human IgE germline gene .
The myb family of transcription factors has been strongly implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in the haematopoietic system .
The v-myb oncogene , carried by avian defective retroviruses , causes leukaemias in the chicken and transforms haematopoietic cells in vitro .
Its normal cellular equivalent c-myb , has been shown to promote the proliferation and block the differentiation of haematopoietic cells in several experimental models and is required for fetal haematopoiesis .
Two other members of the family have been cloned more recently , A-myb and B-myb , which show sequence homology with c-myb in several domains , of which the DNA binding domain as well as other regulatory domains .
Both have been shown to be transcription factors .
B-myb is also involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation , but , unlike c-myb , it is expressed in many cell types .
The third member of the family , A-myb , shows the most restricted pattern of expression , suggesting a very specific role for this transcription factor .
A-myb is expressed in a subpopulation of normal B lymphocytes activated in vivo and localised in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid organs and is not detected at significant levels in all other mature or immature haematopoietic populations studied , including bone marrow cells , T lymphocytes , granulocytes , monocytes , either at rest or after in vitro activation .
These studies indicate that A-myb plays a role during a narrow window of normal B cell differentiation .
A-myb expression has also been studied in a wide range of neoplastic B cells , representing the whole spectrum of B cell differentiation .
A-myb is strongly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphomas ( BL ) and slg+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias ( B-ALL ) and not in all other leukaemias/lymphomas tested , with the exception of a subset of CLL ( about 25 % of cases ) .
It is intriguing that the A-myb genome has been localised relatively close to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 , suggesting that the c-myc translocation in BL and B-ALL may affect A-myb transcription .
Studies are in progress to investigate the functional relationship between A-myb and c-myc , particularly in the context of BL cells and to determine whether A-myb is deregulated in these cells .
The distribution of myeloid lineage-associated cytokine receptors and lysosomal proteins was analyzed in human CD34+ cord blood cell ( CB ) subsets at different stages of myeloid commitment by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
The highly specific granulomonocyte-associated lysosomal proteins myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and lysozyme ( LZ ) , as well as the transcription factor PU.1 , were already detectable in the most immature CD34+Thy-1+ subset .
Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels for the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor , granulocyte-macrophage ( GM ) -CSF receptor alpha subunit and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptors I ( p55 ) and II ( p75 ) were also detected in this subset in addition to c-kit and flt-3 , receptors known to be expressed on progenitor cells .
By contrast , the monocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor was largely absent at this stage and in the CD34+Thy-1-CD45RA- subsets .
The M-CSF receptor was first detectable in the myeloid-committed CD34+Thy-l-CD45RA+ subset .
All other molecules studied were found to be expressed at this stage of differentiation .
Different cocktails of the identified ligands were added to sorted CD34+Thy-1+ single cells .
Low proliferative capacity was observed after 1 week in culture in the presence of stem cell factor ( SCF ) + Flt-3 ligand ( FL ) + G-CSF .
Addition of GM-CSF to this basic cocktail consistently increased the clonogenic capacity of single CD34+Thy-1+ cells , and this effect was further enhanced ( up to 72.3 +/- 4.3 % on day 7 ) by the inclusion of TNF-alpha .
In conclusion , the presence of myeloid-associated growth factor receptor transcripts in CD34+ CB subsets does not discriminate the various stages of differentiation , with the exception of the M-CSF receptor .
In addition , we show that TNF-alpha is a potent costimulatory factor of the very immature CD34+Thy-1+ CB subset .
Monochloramine derivatives are long lived physiological oxidants produced by neutrophils during the respiratory burst .
The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine ( NH2Cl ) on protein kinase C ( PKC ) and PKC-mediated cellular responses were studied in elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils and human Jurkat T cells .
Neutrophils pretreated with NH2Cl ( 30-50 microM ) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which is a potent PKC activator .
These cells , however , were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation , which induces the respiratory burst by a PKC-independent mechanism .
The NH2Cl-treated neutrophils showed a decrease in both PKC activity and PMA-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein , which corresponds to the cytosolic factor of NADPH oxidase , p47 ( phox ) .
Jurkat T cells pretreated with NH2Cl ( 20-70 microM ) showed a decrease in the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain following PMA stimulation .
This was also accompanied by a decrease in both PKC activity and nuclear transcription factor-kappaB activation , also without loss of cell viability .
These results show that NH2Cl inhibits PKC-mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible PKC activity .
The HIV-1 accessory gene product Vpr can influence viral pathogenesis by affecting viral replication as well as host cell transcription and proliferation .
We have investigated the effects of Vpr on host cell activation and confirm that it influences cellular proliferation .
However , we have also found that Vpr modulates T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -triggered apoptosis in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoids .
In the absence of TCR-mediated activation , Vpr induces apoptosis whereas in its presence , Vpr interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis .
This regulation of apoptosis is linked to Vpr suppression of NF-kappa B activity via the induction of I kappa B , an inhibitor of NF-kappa B .
Further , Vpr suppresses expression of IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF alpha and IL-4 , all of which are NF-kappa B-dependent .
The effects of Vpr could be reversed by RU486 .
Our finding that Vpr can regulate NF-kappa B supports the hypothesis that some aspects of viral pathogenesis are the consequence of cell dysregulation by Vpr .
SR 31747A , defined as a sigma ligand , is a novel immunosuppressive agent that blocks proliferation of human and mouse lymphocytes .
Using a radiolabeled chemical probe , we here purified a target of SR 31747A and called it SR 31747A-binding protein ( SR-BP ) .
Purified SR-BP retained its binding properties and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a Mr 28,000 protein .
Cloning of the cDNA encoding human SR-BP shows an open reading frame for a 223-amino acid protein , which is homologous to the recently cloned sigma 1 receptor .
Interestingly , the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be related to fungal C8-C7 sterol isomerase , encoded by the ERG2 gene .
The ERG2 gene product has been identified recently as the molecular target of SR 31747A that mediates antiproliferative effects of the drug in yeast .
Northern blot analysis of SR-BP gene expression revealed a single transcript of 2 kilobases which was widely expressed among organs , with the highest abundance in liver and the lowest abundance in brain .
Subcellular localization analysis in various cells , using a specific monoclonal antibody raised against SR-BP , demonstrated that this protein was associated with the nuclear envelope .
When studying the binding of SR 31747A on membranes from yeast expressing SR-BP , we found a pharmacological profile of sigma 1 receptors ; binding was displaced by (+)-pentazocine , haloperidol , and (+)-SKF 10,047 , with (+)-SKF 10, 047 being a more potent competitor than (-)-SKF 10,047 .
Scatchard plot analysis revealed Kd values of 7.1 nM and 0.15 nM for (+)-pentazocine and SR 31747A , respectively , indicating an affinity of SR-BP 50-fold higher for SR 31747A than for pentazocine .
Additionally , we showed that pentazocine , a competitive inhibitor of SR 31747A binding , also prevents the immunosuppressive effect of SR 31747A .
Taken together , these findings strongly suggest that SR-BP represents the molecular target for SR 31747A in mammalian tissues , which could be critical for T cell proliferation .
EBNA3C is a potent repressor of transcription when bound to DNA as a fusion with the DNA binding domain ( DBD ) of GALA .
A survey of promoters has revealed that the wild-type , unfused EBNA3C can specifically repress expression from reporter plasmids containing the Epstein-Barr virus Cp latency-associated promoter .
Repression of Cp activity required amino acids 207 to 368 , which encompasses a region resembling a basic DBD adjacent to a leucine zipper DNA binding motif and a site which binds to the cellular factor CBF1/RBP-Jkappa .
However , amino acids 207 to 368 are dispensable when the protein is bound to DNA as a fusion with the GAL4 DBD , thus implicating this region in DNA binding .
Mutation of the CBF1/RBP-Jkappa binding site in EBNA3C abrogated repression , strongly suggesting that CBF1/RBP-Jkappa is necessary for targeting the viral protein to Cp .
Consistent with this result , mutation of the EBNA2 response element ( a CBF1/RBP-Jkappa binding site ) in Cp also prevented significant repression .
In addition , amino acids 346 to 543 , which were previously defined as important for the repressor activity of the GAL4-EBNA3C fusion proteins , also appear to be necessary for the repression of Cp .
Since repression by these fusions was not observed in all cell types , it seems likely that EBNA3C either depends on a corepressor which may interact with amino acids 346 to 543 or is modified in a cell-specific manner in order to repress .
These data are consistent with EBNA3C contributing to the regulation of EBNA expression in latently infected B cells through CBF1/RBP-Jkappa and another factor , but this need not directly involve EBNA2 .
Finally , although it has been reported that EBNA3C can upregulate CD21 in some B cells , we were unable to demonstrate any effect of EBNA3C on reporter plasmids which contain the CD21 promoter .
Late gene expression follows and is dependent upon lytic replication of the viral genome .
Although experimental evidence is lacking , lytic viral DNA replication is believed to remove modifications or binding factors from the genome which serve to repress late gene expression during latency or the early lytic cycle .
We have developed a reporter assay to begin characterizing the mechanisms that regulate late gene expression in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
In this model system , the activities of late promoter-reporter fusions are measured following transient transfection into tissue culture cells expressing EBV during different stages of the lytic cycle .
This system faithfully recapitulates late expression patterns from the endogenous virus , implicating specific cis-active sequences in the control of late gene expression .
In addition , these promoters respond only indirectly to the viral immediate-early transactivator , ZEBRA .
This indirect response is mediated by other viral or virally induced activities downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade .
In this system , late gene expression is sensitive to inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase such as phosphonoacetic acid , although the reporters lack a eukaryotic origin of replication and are not replicated under the assay conditions .
Thus , replication of the transcriptional template is not a prerequisite for expression with late kinetics , a finding inconsistent with the current models which posit a cis-active relationship between lytic EBV DNA replication and late gene expression .
Rather , analysis of this system has revealed a trans relationship between late gene expression and viral DNA replication and highlights the indirect and complex link between these two events .
PURPOSE : To demonstrate that leukocyte adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells is mediated by the CD18 antigen , and to determine whether dexamethasone directly suppresses adhesion by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) .
METHODS : Cultured bovine corneal endothelium was stimulated for 6 hours by 40 micron/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) .
Dexamethasone was added 1 hour before TNFalpha stimulation in the dexamethasone group .
After stimulation , neutrophils separated from a healthy human volunteer were added with or without anti-CD18 antibody .
The culture plate was settled for 15 minutes at 37 degrees C , and then neutrophils were activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine for 5 minutes .
Nonadherent neutrophils were removed by sealing and inverting the culture well .
The intracellular localization of NFkappaB after TNFalpha simulation was determined by confocal immunocytochemistry using an anti-p65 antibody .
RESULTS : Neutrophil adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells increased significantly on exposure to TNFalpha ( 451.4+/-45.4 cells/mm2 , n = 16 ) compared to control ( 156.7+/-27.3 cells/mm2 , n = 16 , P < 0.01 ) .
This increased adhesion was suppressed by the addition of anti-CD18 antibody ( 157.6+/-25.1 cells/mm2 , n = 8 , P < 0.01 ) and by pretreatment with 10(-7) M dexamethasone ( 207.9+/-31.5 cells/mm2 , n = 10 , P < 0.01 ) .
Immunocytochemistry 60 minutes after stimulation revealed that NFkappaB was located in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells ; however , the addition of TNFalpha caused NFkappaB to translocate into the nucleus .
Pretreatment with dexamethasone tapered NFkappaB translocation into the nucleus .
CONCLUSIONS : Leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium was shown to be mediated by CD18 expressed on activated leukocytes .
Pretreatment of the endothelium with dexamethasone inhibited leukocyte adhesion ; this may be due in part to the suppression of NFkappaB entry into the nucleus .
On several occasions we have observed retrovirus-like particles ( RVLPs ) by transmission electron microscopy ( EM ) of cultured T cells from a patient with MS .
Later we established spontaneously formed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) from a patient with an MS-like disease and from another patient with MS who had a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection .
Both LCLs were found by EM to produce RVLP and EBV particles .
Reverse transcriptase ( RT ) assays were positive in purified viral material from both LCLs .
To substantiate these findings we initiated an intensified culturing procedure and were able to establish LCLs from 5 out of 21 consecutive MS patients and 1 out of 13 consecutive healthy controls .
All LCLs were found to produce both RVLP and EBV particles by EM .
Whether the putative new retrovirus ( es ) and EBV have any causal relationship to MS is still not known , but the findings support this possibility .
Alcoholic extracts prepared form Arnicae flos , the collective name for flowerheads from Arnica montana and A. chamissonis ssp. foliosa , are used therapeutically as anti-inflammatory remedies .
The active ingredients mediating the pharmacological effect are mainly sesquiterpene lactones , such as helenalin , 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin , chamissonolid and their ester derivatives .
While these compounds affect various cellular processes , current data do not fully explain how sesquiterpene lactones exert their anti-inflammatory effect .
We show here that helenalin , and , to a much lesser degree , 11alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin and chamissonolid , inhibit activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB .
This difference in efficacy , which correlates with the compounds ' anti-inflammatory potency in vivo , may be explained by differences in structure and conformation .
NF-kappaB , which resides in an inactive , cytoplasmic complex in unstimulated cells , is activated by phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory subunit , IkappaB .
Helenalin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in response to four different stimuli in T-cells , B-cells and epithelial cells and abrogates kappaB-driven gene expression .
This inhibition is selective , as the activity of four other transcription factors , Oct-1 , TBP , Sp1 and STAT 5 was not affected .
We show that inhibition is not due to a direct modification of the active NF-kappaB heterodimer .
Rather , helenalin modifies the NF-kappaB/IkappaB complex , preventing the release of IkappaB .
These data suggest a molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of sesquiterpene lactones , which differs from that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , indomethacin and acetyl salicylic acid .
In many chronic inflammatory disorders , glucocorticoid ( GC ) insensitivity is a challenging clinical problem associated with life-threatening disease progression .
The molecular basis of GC insensitivity , however , is unknown .
Alternative splicing of the GC receptor ( R ) pre-messenger RNA generates a second GCR , termed GCR-beta , which does not bind GCs but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR , termed GCR-alpha .
In the current study , we demonstrate that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with a significantly higher number of GCR-beta-immunoreactive cells in peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal controls .
Furthermore , we show that patients with GC-insensitive asthma have cytokine-induced abnormalities in the DNA binding capability of the GCR .
These abnormalities can be reproduced by transfection of cell lines with the GCR-beta gene resulting in significant reduction of their GCR-alpha DNA binding capacity .
We conclude that increased expression of GCR-beta is cytokine inducible and may account for GC insensitivity in this common inflammatory condition .
Bipotential T/natural killer ( NK ) progenitor cells are present in the human thymus .
Despite their bipotential capacity , these progenitors develop predominantly to T cells in the thymus .
The mechanisms controlling this developmental choice are unknown .
Here we present evidence that a member ( s ) of the family of basic helix loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors determines lineage specification of NK/T cell progenitors .
The natural dominant negative HLH factor Id3 , which blocks transcriptional activity of a number of known bHLH factors , was expressed in CD34+ progenitor cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer .
Constitutive expression of Id3 completely blocks development of CD34+ cells into T cells in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .
In contrast , development into NK cells in an FTOC is enhanced .
Thus , the activity of a bHLH transcription factor is necessary for T lineage differentiation of bipotential precursors , in the absence of which a default pathway leading to NK cell development is chosen .
Our results identify a molecular switch for lineage specification in early lymphoid precursors of humans .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel transcription factors may be involved in atherosclerosis , as is suggested by the presence of activated NF-kappa B in human atherosclerotic lesions .
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) on the NF-kappa B system in human THP-1 monocytic cells as well as adherent monocytes .
Our results demonstrate that short-term incubation of these cells with oxLDL activated p50/p65 containing NF-kappa B dimers and induced the expression of the target gene IL-8 .
This activation of NF-kappa B was inhibited by the antioxidant and H2O2 scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor PSI .
The oxLDL-induced NF-kappa B activation was accompanied by an initial depletion of I kappa B-alpha followed by a slight transient increase in the level of this inhibitor protein .
In contrast , long-term treatment with oxLDL prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of I kappa B-alpha , accompanied by an inhibition of both NF-kappa B activation and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes .
These observations provide additional evidence that oxLDL is a potent modulator of gene expression and suggest that ( dys ) regulation of NF-kappa B/Rel is likely to play an important role in atherogenesis .
The class II trans-activator ( CIITA ) is a bi- or multi-functional domain protein which plays a critical role in the expression of MHC class II genes .
We report that removal of the N-terminal 151 amino acids , encompassing all of the acidic domain but leaving intact the proline/serine/threonine-rich domain , results in a mutant protein with potent suppressive properties for MHC class II expression .
HeLa cells stably or transiently transfected with mutant CIITA constructs showed up to 99 % suppression of MHC class II antigen induction by IFN-gamma and marked suppression of HLA-DRA mRNA expression .
Transient transfection of a B lymphoma line resulted in up to 89 % reduction of constitutive MHC class II expression within 5 days and suppression of HLA-DRA mRNA synthesis .
CD30 is a cell-surface receptor that can augment lymphocyte activation and survival through its ability to induce the transcription factor NF-kappaB .
CD30 , however , has also been implicated in the induction of apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes .
Here we show that one of the effects of CD30 signal transduction is to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR1 ) .
This sensitization is dependent on the TRAF-binding sites within the CD30 cytoplasmic domain .
One of the proteins that binds to these sites is TRAF2 , a signal transduction molecule that is also utilized by TNFR1 to mediate the activation of several downstream kinases and transcription factors .
During CD30 signal transduction , we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis .
These data suggest a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of TRAF2 .
Depletion of intracellular TRAF2 and its coassociated proteins also increased the sensitivity of the cell to undergoing apoptosis during activation of death-inducing receptors such as TNFR1 .
Consistent with this hypothesis , expression of a dominant-negative form of TRAF2 was found to potentiate TNFR1-mediated death .
These studies provide a potential mechanism through which CD30 , as well as other TRAF-binding members of the TNFR superfamily , can negatively regulate cell survival .
CD20 is a B-lineage-specific gene expressed at the pre-B-cell stage of B-cell development that disappears on differentiation to plasma cells .
As such , it serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of lineage and developmental stage-specific gene expression .
Using in vivo footprinting we identified two sites in the promoter at -45 and -160 that were occupied only in CD20+ B cells .
The -45 site is an E box that binds basic helix-loop-helix-zipper proteins whereas the -160 site is a composite PU.1 and Pip binding site .
Transfection studies with reporter constructs and various expression vectors verified the importance of these sites .
The composite PU.1 and Pip site likely accounts for both lineage and stage-specific expression of CD20 whereas the CD20 E box binding proteins enhance overall promoter activity and may link the promoter to a distant enhancer .
Activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding TPA responsive elements ( TRE ) are located downstream of the transcription initiation site in the U5 region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
These downstream sequence elements , termed DSE , can bind both AP-1 and CREB/ATF transcription factors .
Recently , we demonstrated that the DSE are also cAMP-responsive elements ( CRE ) , since they mediated activation signals elicited by cholera toxin ( Ctx ) , a potent activator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) signal transduction pathway .
In the present study , we demonstrate that the HIV-1 DSE can mediate the transcriptional synergy elicited by the combination of Ctx and TNFalpha .
Ctx combined with TNFalpha or IL-1beta to produce a synergistic increase in p24 antigen production in U1 promonocytic cells .
Transfection studies of LTR reporter constructs indicated that mutation of the DSE sites abrogated the LTR-mediated synergy induced by Ctx and TNFalpha , whereas the synergy induced by Ctx and IL-1beta was unaffected , suggesting TNFalpha and IL-1beta cooperate differently with the cAMP/PKA activation pathway to induce HIV-1 expression in U1 cells .
Because the DSE are also TRE sites , we assessed the effect of the agonist combinations on AP-1-dependent transcription .
TNFalpha as well as IL-1beta cooperated with Ctx to produce a synergistic activation of AP-1-mediated transcription .
These data indicate that the TRE-like cAMP-responsive DSE sites within the 5'-untranslated leader can mediate the transcriptional cooperativity between TNFalpha and the cAMP/PKA pathway .
Since the DSE and TRE sites can not bind CREB/ATF homodimers , we propose a mechanism in which the HIV-1 DSE bind heterodimers composed of both AP-1 and CREB/ATF proteins .

The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is essential for the transformation of B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines .
Previous data are consistent with a model that LMP1 is a constitutively activated receptor that transduces signals for transformation through its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail .
One transformation effector site ( TES1 ) , located within the membrane proximal 45 residues of the cytoplasmic tail , constitutively engages tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors .
Signals from TES1 are sufficient to drive initial proliferation of infected resting B lymphocytes , but most lymphoblastoid cells infected with a virus that does not express the 155 residues beyond TES1 fail to grow as long-term cell lines .
We now find that mutating two tyrosines to an isoleucine at the carboxyl end of the cytoplasmic tail cripples the ability of EBV to cause lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth , thereby marking a second transformation effector site , TES2 .
A yeast two-hybrid screen identified TES2 interacting proteins , including the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein ( TRADD ) .
TRADD was the only protein that interacted with wild-type TES2 and not with isoleucine-mutated TES2 .
TRADD associated with wild-type LMP1 but not with isoleucine-mutated LMP1 in mammalian cells , and TRADD constitutively associated with LMP1 in EBV-transformed cells .
In transfection assays , TRADD and TES2 synergistically mediated high-level NF-kappaB activation .
These results indicate that LMP1 appropriates TRADD to enable efficient long-term lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth .
High-level NF-kappaB activation also appears to be a critical component of long-term outgrowth .
The Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene ( WT1 ) was previously identified as being imprinted , with frequent maternal expression in human placentae and fetal brains .
We examined the allele-specific expression of WT1 in cultured human fibroblasts from 15 individuals .
Seven of 15 fibroblast lines were heterozygous for polymorphic alleles , and the expression patterns were variable , i.e. , equal , unequal or monoallelic paternal expression in three , two and two cases , respectively .
Exclusive paternal expression of WT1 was also shown in non-cultured peripheral lymphocytes from the latter two individuals .
The allele-specific expression profiles of other imprinted genes , IGF2 and H19 , on human chromosome 11 were constant and consistent with those in other tissues .
Our unexpected observations of paternal or biallelic expression of WT1 in fibroblasts and lymphocytes , together with the previous findings of maternal or biallelic expression in placentae and brains , suggest that the allele-specific regulatory system of WT1 is unique and may be controlled by a putative tissue- and individual-specific modifier .
The JAK ( Janus kinase ) family of protein tyrosine kinases and the STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been shown to be activated in response to a number of cytokines and growth factors .
In this study , we evaluated the activation of JAK/STAT pathway upon human interleukin-5 ( hIL-5 ) stimulation of two different hIL-5-responsive cell lines , hIL-5 receptor alpha-subunit ( hIL-5R alpha ) cDNA-transfected TF-1 ( TF-h5R alpha ) and butyric-acid-treated YY-1 ( YY-Bu ) , and peripheral eosinophils .
Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and activation of STAT5 were induced upon stimulation with hIL-5 in all three cell types , while STAT1 activation was only observed in eosinophils .
These results indicate that JAK2/STAT5 activation is a common JAK/STAT pathway for hIL-5-mediated signal in these cells .
CD40 signaling to B cells is important for generating an effective humoral immune response .
CD40 ligation leads to B cell activation events such as proliferation , Ig secretion , isotype switching , and up-regulation of cell surface molecules , as well as the generation of memory B cells .
Many of these events are dependent upon the ability of CD40 to activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
To define the CD40 signaling components upstream of NF-kappa B activation and the functional consequences downstream of NF-kappa B activation , we examined mouse B cell transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant human CD40 .
Analysis of CD40 cytoplasmic domain truncation and point mutants defined a 10-amino acid CD40 cytoplasmic signaling determinant required for NF-kappa B activation .
A threonine residue at position 234 , previously shown to be important for CD40 association with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 ( TRAF2 ) , TRAF3 , and TRAF5 , was not required for NF-kappa B activation .
This suggests that in B cells , CD40-induced NF-kappa B activation can occur independently of TRAF2 and TRAF5 association .
NF-kappa B activation was independent of the transmembrane domain of CD40 , suggesting that it is independent of p23 , a molecule that associates with CD40 in a region other than the cytoplasmic domain .
Proteasome-dependent inhibitory kappa B alpha ( I kappa B alpha ) and I kappa B beta degradation occurred downstream of CD40 ligation and preceded CD40-mediated NF-kappa B nuclear translocation .
CD40- or pervanadate-mediated I kappa B tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected .
NF-kappa B activation correlated with the ability of CD40 to induce Ab secretion and the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 .
However , NF-kappa B activation was insufficient for CD40-mediated up-regulation of B7-1 , Fas , and CD23 .
Intragenic deletions of TSG101 , the human homolog of a mouse gene ( tsg101 ) that acts to suppress malignant cell growth , were reported in human breast tumours .
We screened TSG101 for somatic mutations in DNA and RNA samples isolated from a variety of common human malignancies , EBV-immortalised B-cells , and normal lung parenchyma .
Intragenic TSG101 deletions in RNA transcripts were frequently found in all types of samples .
Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples .
The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic splice site sequences , suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing .
A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the putative tumour suppressor gene FHIT .
We analysed FHIT in the same series of RNA samples and detected truncated FHIT transcripts frequently in both tumour and normal tissues .
In addition , transcripts from TSG101 , FHIT and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Large TSG101 and FHIT intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in ' aged ' lymphocytes .
Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed .
Our findings demonstrate that truncated TSG101 and FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing .
While we can not exclude that alterations in TSG101 and FHIT occur during cancer development , our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading .
We compared glucocorticoid receptor binding characteristics and glucocorticoid responsiveness of human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) from hypertensive patients and matched normotensive volunteers .
We also considered associations of these variables with plasma renin activity , aldosterone , cortisol , corticotropin , and electrolyte concentrations .
We calculated binding affinity ( Kd ; nmol/L ) and capacity ( Bmax ; sites/cell ) for dexamethasone and cortisol from homologous and heterologous competition curves for specific [3H]dexamethasone binding sites on HML isolated from the blood of normotensive volunteers and subjects with essential hypertension .
Glucocorticoid responsiveness of HML was evaluated as IC50 values ( nmol/L ) for dexamethasone and cortisol for the inhibition of lysozyme release .
We measured plasma hormones by radioimmunoassay .
Kd values ( mean+/-SE ) for cortisol in HML of hypertensive patients were higher than in control subjects ( 24.6+/-2.4 versus 17.5+/-1.7 nmol/L , P < .04 ) .
Binding capacity ( 4978+/-391 versus 4131+/-321 sites/cell ) , Kd values for dexamethasone ( 6.7+/-0.5 versus 5.7+/-0.3 nmol/L ) , and IC50 values for dexamethasone ( 3.4+/-0.3 versus 3.1+/-0.2 nmol/L ) and cortisol ( 12.2+/-1.6 versus 9.5+/-0.3 nmol/L ) were not significantly different .
Patients with renin values less than 0.13 ng angiotensin I/L per second were markedly less sensitive to cortisol than those with higher values .
Both Kd ( 30.3+/-2.5 versus 19.2+/-2.4 nmol/L ) and IC50 values ( 15.5+/-1.8 versus 8.9+/-1.2 nmol/L ) for cortisol were significantly higher in patients with lower renin values ( P < .03 ) .
Other variables , including plasma hormone and electrolyte values and binding characteristics for dexamethasone , were not different .
These data suggest that cortisol binding to glucocorticoid receptor is slightly impaired in patients with essential hypertension .
In vivo , this could lead to inappropriate binding of cortisol to mineralocorticoid receptors .
Hence , decreased sensitivity to cortisol is associated with renin suppression .
This hypothesis is supported by evidence of hypertension and low renin activity , which others have described in patients with primary glucocorticoid resistance due to mutations of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Many aspects of leukocyte function are regulated by both heterotrimeric and Ras-related GTP-binding proteins , but there is little definite information about their roles in the specialized processes utilized by leukocytes for cell killing .
Recent progress in understanding the regulation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase by the Rac GTP-binding proteins provides a basis for defining the operational characteristics of one such phagocyte system .
It is clear from various studies that the activity of the NADPH oxidase can be modulated through the regulation of the GTP-GDP state of Rac .
Proteins exist in leukocytes able to modify GTP-binding protein function in this manner , and their activity may be regulated by signals generated on phagocyte stimulation .
Proteins of the Ras superfamily are likely to be involved in a variety of normal phagocyte functions through their ability to modulate the assembly of actin filaments , direct vesicle trafficking and fusion , and so forth .
The functions of basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors in activating differentiation-linked gene expression and in inducing G1 cell cycle arrest are negatively regulated by members of the Id family of HLH proteins .
These bHLH antagonists are induced during a mitogenic signalling response , and they function by sequestering their bHLH targets in inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind to specific gene regulatory ( E box ) sequences .
Recently , cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue ( Ser5 ) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle , and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro ( E.Hara , M.Hall , and G.Peters , EMBO J.16 : 332-342 , 1997 ) .
We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent reporter gene function in vivo .
Furthermore , compared with wild-type Id3 , an Id3 Asp5 mutant ( mimicking phosphorylation ) is unable to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts , whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant ( ablating phosphorylation ) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein .
Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1-to-S phase that both nullifies an early G1 cell cycle regulatory function of Id3 and modulates its target bHLH specificity .
These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote cell cycle S phase entry is not simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer-dependent gene expression and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation .
The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) group of transcription factors is retained in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells .
NFAT activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import .
This process requires calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT caused by the phosphatase calcineurin .
The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase ( JNK ) phosphorylates NFAT4 on two sites .
Mutational removal of the JNK phosphorylation sites caused constitutive nuclear localization of NFAT4 .
In contrast , JNK activation in calcineurin-stimulated cells caused nuclear exclusion of NFAT4 .
These findings show that the nuclear accumulation of NFAT4 promoted by calcineurin is opposed by the JNK signal transduction pathway .
Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) is an important molecule in promotion of polymorphonuclear neutrophil transendothelial migration during inflammation .
Coincident with many inflammatory diseases is tissue hypoxia .
Thus we hypothesized that combinations of hypoxia and inflammatory stimuli may differentially regulate expression of endothelial ICAM-1 .
Human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of added lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and examined for expression of functional ICAM-1 .
Although hypoxia alone did not induce ICAM-1 , the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced ( 3 +/- 0.4-fold over normoxia ) ICAM-1 expression .
Combinations of hypoxia and LPS significantly increased lymphocyte binding , and such increases were inhibited by addition of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides .
Hypoxic endothelia showed a > 10-fold increase in sensitivity to inhibitors of proteasome activation , and combinations of hypoxia and LPS enhanced proteasome-dependent cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) subunit .
Such proteasome activation correlated with hypoxia-evoked decreases in both extracellular and intracellular pH .
We conclude from these studies that endothelial hypoxia provides a novel , proteasome-dependent stimulus for ICAM-1 induction .
Dendritic cells ( DC ) are potent APCs that enter resting tissues as precursors and , after Ag exposure , differentiate and migrate to draining lymph nodes .
The phenotype of RelB knockout mice implicates this member of the NF kappa B/Rel family in DC differentiation .
To further elucidate the role of RelB in DC differentiation , mRNA , intracellular protein expression , and DNA binding activity of RelB were examined in immature and differentiated human DC , as well as other PB mononuclear cell populations .
RelB protein and mRNA were detected constitutively in lymphocytes and in activated monocytes , differentiated DC , and monocyte-derived DC .
Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated RelB within the differentiated lymph node interdigitating DC and follicular DC , but not undifferentiated DC in normal skin .
Active nuclear RelB was detected by supershift assay only in differentiated DC derived from either PB precursors or monocytes and in activated B cells .
These RelB+ APC were potent stimulators of the MLR .
The data indicate that RelB expression is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally in myeloid cells .
Within the nucleus , RelB may specifically transactivate genes that are critical for APC function .
There are many hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of endometriosis , though no single theory can explain all cases .
It is likely that several mechanisms are involved .
Early studies concentrated on the histogenesis of the endometriotic lesion .
Recent evidence has implicated components of the immune system in the pathogenesis of endometriosis .
This review considers the evidence for different theories of the histogenesis of endometriosis and discusses possible immune factors that may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease .
This study evaluates ( i ) constitutive levels of oncogene and p53 transcripts in chronic phase CML patients and ( ii ) their modulations subsequent to in vivo therapy with rIFN-alpha 2c .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) and bone marrow cells of 26 patients were examined for c-fos , c-myc , p53 and the hybrid bcr/abl mRNA levels .
Results indicated that ( i ) constitutive c-fos transcript levels are significantly higher in patients subsequently responding to IFN-alpha therapy ( p < 0.01 ) and positively correlated with the proportion of lymphocytes ( r = 0.6895 , p < 0.01 ) and negatively with the proportion of immature cells ( r = -0.568 , p < 0.01 ) contained in the pbmc preparations tested , ( ii ) constitutive mRNA levels of the hybrid bcr/abl , c-myc and p53 are positively correlated with each other , but failed to relate to disease parameters , and ( iii ) acute and chronic in vivo exposure to IFN-alpha is accompanied by upregulation of c-fos and downregulation of c-myc mRNA levels in responder patients .
In order to inquire into the functional state of adrenal cortex in patients with pulmonary heart disease , the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease was determined with radioligand-binding assay and the corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed with radioimmune assays .
The results showed that the number of GCR in the patients was significantly reduced ( P < 0.01 ) and it was increased when their health state was improved .
However , it was still lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0.01 ) .
The number of GCR in the patients was greatly increased when these patients were treated with oxygen ( P < 0.01 ) .
No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects ( P > 0.05 ) .
These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients , but the lower GCR number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients .
The number of GCR may be improved by inhalation of oxygen .
Therefore oxygen therapy is helpful in raising the activity of glucocorticoid receptors and controlling the development of the disease .
The interleukin-1 receptor type I ( IL-1RI ) is associated with other proteins thus forming a complex system by which IL-1 exerts its various signals .
The initiating event is still uncertain , but activation of a recently described receptor-associated protein kinase is one of the earliest events detectable ( Martin et al. , Eur.J.Immunol.1994.24 : 1566 ) .
IL-1 signaling is commonly accompanied by oxidative processes and is thought to be subject to redox regulation .
We therefore investigated whether the activation of the IL-1RI-associated protein kinase could be a target for redox regulation and whether an altered activity of the kinase could influence IL-1-mediated NF-kappa B activation .
A murine T cell line , EL4 , was stimulated with IL-1 with and without pretreatment with different compounds known to influence the cellular redox status .
Thiol modifying agents like diamide , menadione , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , diethyl dithiocarbamate or phenylarsine oxide inhibited the IL-1-induced activation of the IL-1RI-associated protein kinase .
N-Acetylcysteine , alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl , aminotriazole or nitrofurantoin did not show any effect .
The inhibition by PDTC was reversible unless glutathione synthesis was blocked by buthionine sulfoximine .
The described conditions which inhibited or prevented the activation of the IL-1RI-associated kinase similarly impaired the activation of NF-kappa B in EL4 cells .
From these observations we conclude that free thiols in the IL-1RI complex are essential for the activation of the IL-1RI-associated protein kinase and that this process is mandatory for IL-1 signaling leading to NF-kappa B activation .
Differanisole A , 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-n-propylbenzoic acid , inhibited growth of human myeloid leukemia cells .
The compound induced G1 arrest and granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells , although the differentiation-inducing effect was modest .
Differanisole A and 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9cisRA ) synergistically inhibited the growth and induced functional and morphologic differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells , whereas the combined treatment with differanisole A and all-trans retinoic acid or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less effective .
Similar results were obtained in primary culture of leukemia cells from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia .
The synergistic effect on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation required simultaneous treatment with differanisole A and 9cisRA .
Differanisole A and an RXR-specific ligand ( Ro47-5944 ) cooperatively inhibited the cell growth , while the combined effect of differanisole A and an RAR-specific ligand Am80 was just additive .
Differanisole A in combination with 9cisRA may have implications for therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients .
BACKGROUND : Myeloid cell development is controlled by tissue-specific transcription factors .
Human myeloid zinc finger protein ( MZF-1 ) is a putative transcription factor containing 13 zinc fingers , and has been suggested that it regulates the development of neutrophilic granulocytes .
RESULTS : Here , we have isolated the murine and human cDNAs which encode a novel form of MZF protein ( MZF-2 ) .
Murine and human MZF-2 proteins consisted of 814 and 775 amino acids , respectively , and have identity of 75.3 % between them .
The C-terminal half of human MZF-2 , carrying the zinc finger domains , was completely identical with that of human MZF-1 , whereas the N-terminal half of MZF-2 was different from the corresponding region of human MZF-1 , and was coded by distinct exons .
MZF-2 mRNA was expressed in myeloid cells , particularly in the cells committed to the neutrophilic lineage , and down-regulated by G-CSF .
CONCLUSIONS : MZF-1 and MZF-2 mRNAs seem to be produced by the alternative use of two different transcription initiation sites .
The distinct N-terminal half of MZF-2 carries two characteristic domains , a leucine-rich domain called LeR and an acidic domain , which suggests a unique function of MZF-2 in neutrophil development .
To further clarify the complex transcriptional regulation of the human GM-CSF gene , which was extensively investigated in activated T cells , we have studied the role of an upstream NF-kappaB like site in the 5637 non-lymphoid cell line , which derives from a bladder carcinoma and constitutively produces GM-CSF .
This sequence , named the A element , has an active role on GM-CSF transcription and is responsive to the tumor promoter PMA in transient transfection experiments .
We describe here a heterodimeric binding complex of NF-kappaB subunits ( c-Rel and p65 ) which is identical to the one obtained using the HIV-LTR-kappaB site as recognition sequence and different from the one ( c-Rel and p50 ) observed with nuclear extracts from Mo T-lymphoid HTLV-II infected cells .
We investigated the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) repertoire to an HLA B8-restricted peptide , RAKFKQLLQ , located in the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) immediate-early protein , BZLF1 .
Repertoire selection was monitored by determining the TCR beta chain sequences of RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL established from primary infected and healthy virus carriers .
PCR analysis of spontaneous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) from three individuals with primary infection showed that two were infected with type A and one with type B EBV .
Polyclonal and clonal CTL that were generated by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an HLA B8+ homozygous LCL lysed T cell blasts pulsed with the peptide , RAKFKQLLQ ; lysis of certain HLA B8+ LCL targets was associated with the abundance of BZLF1 transcripts .
TCR beta analysis showed that while there was loop length restriction in the putative peptide contact site of all responding beta chains , diverse and unique ( non-recurrent ) TCR beta clonotypes were selected in individuals during primary infection and continued to emerge after long-term virus exposure .
TCR-contact site heterogeneity was excluded as the selective force in diversity generation since the epitope-encoded sequences were found to be identical within endogenous virus isolates .
In this first study of TCR repertoire selection for an EBV lytic antigen , a BZLF1-reactive component of diverse clonotypes was identified in primary type A or type B EBV infection which was sustained in the EBV-specific memory response throughout life-long infection .
This diversity selection is likely to play a critical role in maintaining a balanced viral load throughout EBV persistence .
The human autosomal recessive disease , xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) , can result from mutations in any one of seven genes , designated XPA through XPG .
Of these , the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor , TFIIH , involved in both nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and initiation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II .
In humans , mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER , resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation .
However , no transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D .
We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D .
Although the growth rate was normal , the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH .
Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar transcription activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells .
Thus , we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do not have impaired RNA transcription activity .
We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients , and discuss a ' conditional phenotype ' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions .
The estrogen receptor ( ER ) repressed erythroid differentiation and erythroid-specific gene expression .
In this study , we investigated the effect of ER alpha ( referred to throughout as ER ) on DNA-binding activities of transcription factors involved in regulating the expression of erythroid-specific genes , and , in particular , the histone H5 gene .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate , human ER reduced the binding activities of chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins to GATA and CACCC sites in the H5 promoter and enhancer .
In contrast , the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were not affected by ER .
Binding of ER to an estrogen response element was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate .
This lysate was also necessary for ER to diminish the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 .
These results suggest that additional factor ( s ) are necessary for full ER function .
Both GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins are critical for the developmentally regulated expression of erythroid-specific genes .
We hypothesize that interference in DNA-binding activities of GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins is the mechanism by which the ER inhibits regulation of these genes .
AIMS AND BACKGROUND : Structurally altered proteins ( derived from chromosomal translocations or gene mutations ) can be considered tumor specific antigens and represent an attractive target for a T-cell mediated response .
T lymphocytes recognize antigens in the form of peptides bound to HLA-molecules .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Peptides derived from oncogenic proteins were screened for the presence of HLA binding motifs ; actual binding were evaluated by HLA stabilization experiments using transfectants and specific anti-HLA antibodies .
Specific lymphocytes were induced by in vitro peptide sensitization and screened by thymidine uptake or cellular cytotoxic assays .
RESULTS : We identified peptides derived from EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein and from mutated K-RAS protein ( encompassing respectively the fusion point and the mutation at position 12 ) that showed binding motif for HLA-Cw*0702 and HLA-A3 respectively .
The actual binding of these peptides was analysed in a stabilization assay .
We detected binding for the EWS/FLI-1 peptide and for 5 RAS peptides ( 1 wild type and 4 mutated ) .
The effect of temperature , beta 2-microglobulin ( beta 2-m ) and fetal calf serum ( FCS ) on the binding and the stability of the HLA/peptide complex was studied .
A low temperature ( 26 degrees C ) increased the binding both in HLA-A3 and HLA-Cw*0702 , while FCS reduced it .
beta 2-m increased the binding to the HLA-A3 molecule but did not influence the binding to the HLA-Cw*0702 .
The stability of already formed complexed was somewhat different in the HLA-A3 and HLA-Cw*0702 system : both were more stable at 26 degrees C than at 37 degrees C but while the beta 2-m and FCS did not influence the stability of the HLA-A3/peptide complex , they seemed to cause opposite effects in the HLA-Cw*0702 system ( beta 2-m stabilized and FCS destabilized the complex ) .
Finally , we were able to generate a specific CD8+ CTL line against a K-RAS mutated peptide .
CONCLUSIONS : Although binding motifs and actual HLA binding can be detected in several cases , the generation of a cellular response is infrequent , confirming that HLA binding is necessary but not sufficient to obtain an in vitro response .
Further optimization of culture conditions , type of Antigen Presenting Cells ( APC ) , peptides , use of stabilizers like beta 2-m are still needed .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha controls T-cell activation and is a major inducer of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 replication in chronically infected cells .
Therefore , we have investigated its role in primary cultures of HIV-infected human T lymphocytes by using neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or TNF-alpha .
Primary resting T lymphocytes produced TNF-alpha and supported HIV replication after T-cell receptor activation .
Addition of neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies drastically reduced p24 antigen release and prevented CD4+ cell depletion associated with infection .
Anti-TNF-alpha also prevented nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation , and a good correlation between this inhibition and inhibition of HIV replication was observed .
Moreover , supplementing the cultures with high doses of IL-2 reverted anti-TNF-alpha inhibition of cell proliferation but did not affect the inhibition of HIV p24 antigen release or NF-kappa B activation in the same cultures .
Moreover , anti-TNF-alpha inhibited HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -driven transcription of a reporter gene in primary T cells in response to activation , either in the presence or the absence of HIV-1 Tat .
Our results support an important role for autocrine TNF-alpha secretion in controlling HIV replication in primary T cells because of its ability to maintain NF-kappa B elevated in the nucleus of T cells .
The binding site for nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is present at the promoter region of the germline Cepsilon gene , but there is little information on whether this factor is involved in regulating IgE synthesis by human B cells .
Accordingly , we studied the role of NF-kappaB in germline Cepsilon transcription by using two human Burkitt 's lymphoma B cell lines , DND39 and DG75 .
In both cell lines , n-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent thiol antioxidant , inhibited the triggering of the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB by IL-4 and by anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody .
Although IL-4 activated signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 6 in addition to NF-kappaB , NAC treatment or the transfection of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides for NF-kappaB or STAT6 only partly blocked IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription .
However , these two decoy oligodeoxynucleotides together almost completely abrogated IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription .
Of note , CD40-mediated enhancement of IL-4-driven germline Cepsilon transcription was markedly decreased by NAC or by a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide for NF-kappaB .
The effect of NAC was also examined on deletional switch recombination underlying the isotype switch to IgE .
NAC inhibited the generation of Smu/Sepsilon switch fragments in normal human B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody .
It also abolished IL-4-induced upregulation of CD40 but promoted upregulation of CD23 .
These results suggest that coordination of NF-kappaB and STAT6 may be required for induction of germline Cepsilon transcription by IL-4 , and that CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation may be important in regulating both enhancement of germline Cepsilon transcription and class switching to IgE .
Transcription factor NF-kappa B must be released from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules ( I kappa Bs ) in order to move to the nucleus and to activate its target genes .
Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B in some cell-types and of sustained nuclear NF-kappa B activity after stimulation .
Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive NF-kappa B activity in mature B cells .
We therefore compared the turnover of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in mature B cells and HeLa cells .
Both proteins display a high turnover in B cells although I kappa B beta is considerably more stable than I kappa B alpha .
The half-life of both inhibitors is increased in HeLa cells .
In contrast , all other NF-kappa B/I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell-types .
The elevated turnover of endogenous I kappa B alpha in Namalwa cells is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in non-B cells .
Furthermore , we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of NF-kappa B .
TNF-alpha signaling leads to a rapid depletion of cellular I kappa B beta pools .
I kappa B alpha is efficiently resynthesized whereas I kappa B beta levels stay low for a prolonged time .
NF-kappa B binding activity can be detected for several hours after stimulation .
We found that removal of the TNF-alpha containing medium causes a rapid decrease in nuclear NF-kappa B .
A phosphoform of newly synthesized I kappa B alpha is visible when degradation by the proteasome is inhibited and new I kappa B alpha displays the same properties regarding phosphorylation and degradation in response to a second inducer .
There is no significant difference in the turnover of pre- and post-inductive I kappa B alpha .
These observations suggest that resynthesis of I kappa B alpha and removal of the stimulus are obligatory steps for the inactivation of nuclear NF kappa B .
The transcription factor NF-kappa B is maintained in an inactive cytoplasmic state by I kappa B inhibitors .
In mammalian cells , I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta proteins have been purified and shown to be the inhibitors of NF-kappa B through their association with the p65 or c-Rel subunits .
In addition , we have isolated a third NF-kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B epsilon ( 1 ) .
Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta are proteolytically degraded , resulting in NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus .
Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published .
Our data also suggest that , unlike I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta is constitutively phosphorylated and resynthesized as a hypophosphorylated form .
The absence of slow migrating forms of I kappa B beta following stimulation suggests that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal-induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis .
We recently identified the winged-helix transcription factor Trident and described its expression pattern in synchronized fibroblasts .
We have now studied Trident expression in cell lines , differentiating thymocytes and in lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood .
During T cell differentiation , expression peaked in the actively dividing immature single positive cells .
In peripheral blood lymphocytes , expression of Trident mRNA was absent , but could be induced upon stimulation with mitogens in vitro .
These observations imply a function for Trident in dividing lymphocytes .
Infection of human monocytes with influenza A virus induces a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines and mononuclear cell attracting chemokines before the infected cells undergo apoptosis .
The underlying mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are transcriptionally initiated after virus infection are still poorly understood .
Activation of NF-kappa B seems to play an important role in the regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes , but can not be the only mechanism , since several cytokine genes lack respective binding sites in their promoter regions .
Therefore , we additionally investigated other transcription factors of possible importance such as CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , and OTF-2 .
To explore long-term regulatory mechanisms , we investigated the induction of transcription factors on the gene expression level which may be important to substitute for metabolized transcription factor proteins after their activation .
We identified a cell-type-specific differential response : CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , OFT-2 , and NF-kappa B genes were strongly induced 1 to 4 hours after influenza A virus infection in the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 , while in freshly prepared human monocytes no significant changes were detected .
In infected monocytes , which die by apoptosis , the expression of CREB , CTF , and OTF-2 was rather suppressed 8 hours after infection .
In conclusion , the long-term regulation of transcription factor gene expression in non-proliferating cells seems to be of minor importance after influenza infection since in apoptosisprone cells an immediate availability of transcription factor proteins is required .
The problem of the neuro-immuno interactions on the level of the protein trans-factors , stimulating interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene expression was discussed .
The physico-chemical and functional parameters of the low molecular nuclear proteins ( SP and BP- 14 , 18 , 19 kDs ) isolated from splenic and brain cells of immunized rats were studied .
The binding of these proteins to the regulatory region of IL-2 gene in vitro and stimulation of the IL-2mRNA synthesis in splenic T- lymphocytes culture in normal conditions were shown .
The protective effect of SP and BP on the IL-2mRNA synthesis in stressful conditions and by the T-cells treatment with the CsA was demonstrated .
Interleukin-12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells , and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells via CD40-CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) .
So far , transcriptional analyses of p40 have been carried out only using bacterial constituents such as LPS as stimuli .
In the present study , we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line , Daudi , and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 .
These cells , stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector , secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression .
Sequence analysis of the p40 promoter region identified two potential nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB binding sites conserved between mouse and human .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation .
Moreover , transfection of Daudi cells with the polymerized NF-kappaB binding sequence ligated to a thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid greatly induced CAT activity , but transfection with the polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence did not .
These results suggest that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB .
Lipopolysaccharide is one of the most potent trigger substances for monocytes and macrophages causing secretion of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 .
The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these cytokine genes is still unknown .
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65 ) proteins have been suggested to play an important role in gene transcription of inflammatory mediators when monocytes are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide .
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation , and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently .
Salicylates have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced gene transcription via inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of NF-kappa B inhibitor " I kappa B " , blocking the translocation of NF-kappa B into the nuclear compartment .
However , the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has not been defined .
To examine the mechanisms by which salicylates affect cytokine gene transcription , the amount of active and inactive NF-kappa B and NF-kappa B mRNA , in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells was assessed .
High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed NF-kappa B p65 mRNA accumulation , resulting in suppression of total NF-kappa B , p50 on tissue oligonucleotide had no effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappa B activation .
The data demonstrate that the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B is inhibited by salicylate treatment and highlight the role of salicylate in the control of gene expression of inflammatory mediators .
We measured the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in cord blood lymphocytes and the binding affinity ( Kd ) in 15 term and in 20 preterm babies .
Thirteen preterms of the latter group received prenatal steroid treatment .
Seven preterms developed neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ( NRDS ) .
The number of GR and the Kd were similar in the term and preterm ( with and without NRDS ) babies .
The maximum (3H)-thymidine incorporation into DNA of cord blood lymphocytes from all preterms , with or without NRDS was suppressed when compared to that from term babies or adults .
This could partly be explained by the antenatal steroid treatment .
Sensitivity ( ID50 ) of the lymphocytes for the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was the same in all groups .
In this study on the number and function of GR in lymphocytes , we were unable to find a relation between the functionality of the GR and the development of NRDS .
It is now well appreciated that chronic gut inflammation is characterized by enhanced production of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen .
Some of these oxidants are known to modulate the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses .
For example , certain oxidants are known to activate the nuclear transcription factor kappa B , which regulates the expression of a variety of different adhesion molecules , cytokines , and enzymes .
Oxidants are also known to activate another transcription factor , activator protein-1 .
This transcription factor is composed of products from the fos and jun proto-oncogene family and is believed to be important in regulating cell growth and proliferation .
Finally , oxidants are believed to promote intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis , and the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene product is believed to inhibit this phenomenon in an antioxidant-dependent manner .
Taken together , these observations suggest that nontoxic concentrations of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and in modulating apoptosis .
Recently , fibromyalgia ( FMS ) was shown to be a disorder associated with an altered functioning of the stress response system .
FMS patients display a hyperreactive pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) release in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) and to insulin-induced hypoglycemia .
We suggested that negative feedback of cortisol could be deranged .
Therefore we investigated the properties and function of the glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in FMS patients and compared the results with those of healthy persons and patients with chronic low back pain ( LBP a localized pain condition ) .
Forty primary FMS patients ( F : M = 36 : 4 ) , 28 LBP patients ( 25 : 3 ) and 14 ( 12 : 2 ) healthy , sedentary control persons were recruited for the study .
Urinary free cortisol excretion in FMS and LBP patients was lower compared to controls .
Only FMS patients displayed lower CBG and basal serum cortisol concentrations when compared to controls .
However , plasma free cortisol concentrations were similar in the three groups .
There was no difference in the number of GR per cell among the three groups ( FMS : 6498 +/- 252 , LBP : 6625 +/- 284 , controls : 6576 +/- 304 ) , but the dissociation constant ( Kd ) of the FMS ( 14.5 +/- 0.9 nmol/l ) and LBP ( 14.7 +/- 1.3 nmol/l ) subjects was significantly higher than that of the controls ( 10.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/l ) ( p < .05 ) .
The maximal stimulation of the lymphocytes , as measured by the maximal thymidine incorporation ( in the absence of cortisol ) in the FMS group was approximately 1.5 times higher ( p < .05 ) than in the control or LBP group .
The ED50 ( the cortisol concentration giving 50 % inhibition of the thymidine incorporation ) , however , was identical in all three groups .
We conclude that FMS patients have a mild hypocortisolemia , increased cortisol feedback resistance in combination probably with a reduced CRH synthesis or release in the hypothalamus .
The role of the GR and mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) in the CRH regulation in the FMS patients remains to be solved .
Heparin is a polyanionic glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) that can bind with high affinity to a range of cytokines including interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and members of the chemokine superfamily .
This GAG also possesses immunomodulatory activity in vivo and can antagonize the capacity of IFN-gamma to induce class II MHC antigen expression , and to up-regulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , by cultured endothelial cells .
Previous studies have shown that binding to cell-surface heparan sulphate is essential for optimal activity of IFN-gamma and that free heparin competitively inhibits this sequestration process .
The present study was performed to increase our understanding of the immunosuppressive activity of heparin by investigation of potential antagonism of the production and function of monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 ( MCP-1 ) , a chemokine important for mononuclear leucocyte recruitment across vascular endothelium .
It was found that mixture of heparin with IFN-gamma inhibited up-regulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein , STAT-1 produced normally by treatment of endothelial cells with IFN-gamma .
An inhibition of MCP-1 production was observed that was specifically caused by mixture of IFN-gamma with heparin-like , and therefore cytokine-binding , GAGs .
It was also shown that mixture of heparin-like GAGs with MCP-1 inhibited the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase which is normally produced by treatment of mononuclear leucocytes with this chemokine .
Blockade of this intracellular signalling event was associated with a reduction in the normal transendothelial migration response towards MCP-1 .
Results from this study indicate that soluble , heparin-like GAGs can block IFN-gamma-dependent up-regulation of MCP-1 production by cultured endothelial cells , and can also antagonize the leucocyte-activating and migration-promoting properties of pre-existing MCP-1 .
These activities may contribute to the immunomodulatory properties of heparin .
A chimeric TCR gene , comprising an anti-hapten single-chain Ab variable fragment fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the human TCR zeta-chain , was used to determine whether the tetracycline-regulatable system could be used to regulate gene expression in T cells .
Jurkat T cells were stably transfected with a single vector encoding the tetracycline trans-activator protein , controlled by a constitutive promoter , and the chimeric TCR , under the control of a trans-activator protein-responsive promoter .
In the absence of tetracyclines , the transfected T cells were shown to express the chimeric receptor on the cell surface and could be activated by its cognate Ag , leading to the secretion of IL-2 .
When the cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of tetracyclines , surface expression of the chimeric receptor was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner , and this suppression was sufficient to result in complete loss of responsiveness to the targeted Ag .
Prolonged suppression of trans-gene expression for up to 7 days was observed after doxycycline was removed from the cultures , but eventual recovery of surface expression was complete , and the absolute time to recovery was directly proportional to the initial concentration of the drug .
Pharmacologic control of trans-gene expression in gene-modified T cells will not only facilitate new approaches to the study of different aspects of T cell biology , but will also provide the basis for new gene therapy strategies .
Activation of Janus tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) after ligation of major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) was explored in Jurkat T cells .
Cross-linking of MHC-I mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 , but not Jak1 , Jak2 , and Jak3 .
In addition , the transcription factor Stat-3 was tyrosine phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus .
Data obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the activated Stat-3 protein associates with the human serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) DNA-probe derived from the interferon-gamma activated site ( GAS ) in the c-fos promoter , a common DNA sequence for Stat protein binding .
An association between hSIE and Stat-3 after MHC-I ligation was directly demonstrated by precipitating Stat-3 from nuclear extracts with biotinylated hSIE probe and avidin-coupled agarose .
To investigate the function of the activated Stat-3 , Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with a Stat-3 isoform lacking the transactivating domain .
This dominant-negative acting Stat-3 isoform significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by ligation of MHC-I .
In conclusion , our data suggest the involvement of the Jak/Stat signal pathway in MHC-I-induced signal transduction in T cells .
The translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
A recent study showed a MLL/AF10 fusion in all cases of AML with t(10;11) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11 ranging from q13 to q23 .
We recently cloned CALM ( Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene ) , the fusion partner of AF10 at 11q14 in the monocytic cell line U937 .
To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias , 10 cases ( 9 AML and 1 ALL ) with cytogenetically proven t(10;11)(p12-14;q13-21) and well-characterized morphology , immunophenotype , and clinical course were analyzed .
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) was performed with 2 YACs flanking the CALM region , a YAC contig of the MLL region , and a YAC spanning the AF10 breakpoint .
Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced t(10;11) .
In 4 cases , including 3 AML with immature morphology ( 1 AML-M0 and 2 AML-M1 ) and 1 ALL , the signals of the CALM YACS were separated in interphase cells , indicating a translocation breakpoint within the CALM region .
MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation ( 2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5 ) , including 1 secondary AML .
In all 3 cases , a characteristic immunophenotype was identified ( CD4+ , CD13- , CD33+ , CD65s+ ) .
AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases , including 1 case without detectable CALM or MLL rearrangement .
In 2 complex translocations , none of the three genes was rearranged .
All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis , with a mean survival of 9.6 +/- 6.6 months .
For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols , disease-free and overall survival was significantly worse than for the overall study group ( P = .03 and P = .01 , respectively ) .
We conclude that the t(10;11)(p13;q14) indicates CALM and MLL rearrangements in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia and may be associated with a poor prognosis .
Pax-5 codes for the transcription factor BSAP which is expressed throughout B cell development except in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
Gene targeting experiments in the mouse revealed a differential dependency of fetal and adult B-lymphopoiesis on this transcription factor .
BSAP is required for B-lineage commitment in the fetal liver and for progression beyond an early pro-B cell stage in adult bone marrow .
The characterization of Pax-5-deficient pro-B cells demonstrated an important role of BSAP in the regulation of the CD19 , mb-1 ( Ig alpha ) and N-myc genes as well as in the developmental pathway controlling VH-to-DHJH recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) locus .
The human PAX-5 gene was recently shown to participate together with the IgH locus in the chromosomal translocation t(9;14)(p13;q32) .
This translocation is characteristic of a small subset of non-Hodgkin lymphomas exhibiting plasmacytoid differentiation .
The translocated PAX-5 gene is deregulated by the insertion of IgH regulatory elements into its 5' region , which may contribute to tumorigenesis by interfering with the shut-down of PAX-5 transcription and thus with the completion of plasma cell differentiation .
The binding of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) to its receptor on normal T cells induces nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , activation of the IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain gene , and cell proliferation .
In the present study , the role of IL-2R signaling in the growth of CD8+ T cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) cells has been investigated .
Flow cytometry revealed that primary leukemia cells from a patient with CD8+ T-PLL expressed IL-2Ralpha and beta chains , and the cells showed a proliferative response and an increase in IL-2Ralpha expression on culture with exogeneous IL-2 .
Northern blot analysis failed to detect IL-2 mRNA , suggesting that IL-2 may act in a paracrine manner in vivo .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that recombinant IL-2 increased NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of the leukemia cells , and Northern blot analysis showed that IL-2 increased the abundance of mRNAs encoding the NF-kappaB components c-Rel and KBF1 in these cells .
IL-2 binding analysis demonstrated that IL-2 markedly increased the number of low affinity IL-2Rs on the leukemia cells , without an effect on the number of high-affinity IL-2Rs .
These results show that IL-2 is capable of inducing the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB in primary CD8+ T-PLL cells , and that this effect is mediated , at least in part , at a pretranslational level .
Molecular dissection of the B-cell-specific transcription coactivator OCA-B has revealed distinct regions important , respectively , for recruitment to immunoglobulin promoters through interaction with octamer-bound Oct-1 and for subsequent coactivator function .
Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of PC4 from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors .
Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant PC4 and the PC4-depleted USA fraction , thus suggesting a joint requirement for PC4 and another , USA-derived component ( s ) for optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in the reconstituted system .
Indeed , USA-derived PC2 was found to act synergistically with PC4 in reproducing the function of intact USA in the assay system .
Consistent with the requirement for PC4 in the reconstituted system , OCA-B was found to interact directly with PC4 .
Surprisingly , however , removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription .
These results lead to a general model for the synergistic function of activation domains in Oct-1 and OCA-B ( mediated by the combined action of the multiple USA components ) and , further , suggest a functional redundancy in general coactivators .
Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) .
The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system .
These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4-expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals .
Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .
The implication of protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) , protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 .
It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .
M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild-type , but not the kappaB-mutated , HIV-1 LTR region .
Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous TNF-alpha .
The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in T cells and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection .
IL-13 , a cytokine similar to IL-4 , is a regulator of human B cell and monocyte functions .
Biologic effects of IL-13 on primary human NK and T cells have not been well defined .
We demonstrate that , in primary NK cells , IL-13 , but not IL-4 , may induce low levels of IFN-gamma secretion .
When NK cells were costimulated with IL-13 and IL-2 , IL-13 generally resulted in two types of reactivity : IL-13 synergized with IL-2 to stimulate IFN-gamma production or it modestly inhibited IL-2-mediated IFN-gamma production .
In both types of donors , the effect of IL-13 on IL-2-induced IFN-gamma production was in marked contrast to the strong inhibition seen with IL-4 in NK cells .
Additionally , IL-13 suppresses IL-2-induced NK cytolytic and proliferative activities although less efficiently than IL-4 .
In T cells , IL-13 inhibits anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2- or PHA-mediated IFN-gamma production and enhances cytolytic potential .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that IL-13 , like IL-4 , induces distinct STAT6-DNA binding complexes and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 and Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) in NK and T cells .
We observed that Abs directed against unique domains of STAT6 have differential effects on complexes in T cells but not in NK cells , suggesting different STAT6 isoforms .
These findings show that IL-13 and IL-4 have the ability to regulate NK and T cell activation and that IL- 13 is a potent regulator of STAT6 and JAK3 in these cell types .
By using high throughput screening of microbial broths , we have identified a compound , designated Ro 09-2210 , which is able to block anti-CD3 induced peripheral blood T cell activation with an IC50 = 40 nM .
Ro 09-2210 was also able to block antigen-induced IL-2 secretion with an IC50 = 30 nM , but was considerably less potent at blocking Ca2+ flux stimulated by anti-CD3 treatment .
To determine the mechanism of action of Ro 09-2210 , we set up a transient expression system in Jurkat T cells using a variety of reporter gene constructs and showed effective inhibition of phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced NF-AT activation and anti-CD3 induced NF-AT with IC50 = 7.7 and 10 nM , respectively .
Ro 09-2210 was also able to inhibit phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced activation of AP1 with IC50 = < 10 nM .
We further showed that Ro 09-2210 was unable to inhibit c-jun induced expression of AP1-dependent reporter constructs ( IC50 > 500 nM ) , but was able to potently inhibit ras-induced AP1 activation ( IC50 = 20 nM ) .
This suggested that Ro 09-2210 was inhibiting an activator of AP-1 which was upstream of c-jun and downstream of ras signaling .
To investigate further , we then purified a number of different kinases , including PKC , PhK , ZAP-70 , ERK , and MEK 1 ( a MKK ) , and showed that Ro 09-2210 was a selective inhibitor of MEK1 in vitro ( IC50 = 59 nM ) .
A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464 , capable of activating granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) signal transduction pathways , was identified in a high-throughput assay in cultured cells .
Like G-CSF , SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins and stimulated primary murine bone marrow cells to form granulocytic colonies in vitro .
It also elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts in mice .
The extracellular domain of the murine G-CSF receptor was required for the activity of SB 247464 , suggesting that the compound acts by oligomerizing receptor chains .
The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand .
We examined signaling by erythropoietin in highly purified human colony forming unit-erythroid cells , generated in vitro from CD34(+) cells .
We found that erythropoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 , STAT5A , and STAT5B .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 reaches a peak around 10 minutes after stimulation and is maximum at 5 U/mL of erythropoietin .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 is accompanied by the translocation of activated STAT5 to the nucleus as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using 32Pi-labeled STAT5 binding site in the beta-casein promoter .
Tyrosine phosphorylation STAT1 or STAT3 was not detected in human erythroid precursors after stimulation with erythropoietin .
Crkl , an SH2/SH3 adapter protein , becomes coimmunoprecipitated specifically with STAT5 from erythropoietin-stimulated erythroid cells ; although it was shown to become associated with c-Cbl in the studies using cell lines .
Thus , human erythroid precursors can be expanded in vitro in sufficient numbers and purity to allow its usage in signal transduction studies .
This report sets a basis for further studies on signaling in primary cultured human erythroid precursors , which in turn contribute to our better understanding in the differentiation processes of erythrocytes and their precursors .
We recently determined that erythropoietin ( EPO ) activates 3 members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family , Stat1alpha , Stat3 , and Stat5 , in the human EPO-dependent cell lines , UT-7 and UT-7/EPO ( Kirito et al , J Biol Chem 272 : 16507 , 1997 ) .
In addition , we have shown that Stat1alpha , but not Stat3 , is involved in EPO-induced cellular proliferation .
In this study , we examined the roles of Stat1alpha and Stat3 in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation .
UT-7/GM was used as a model system , because this cell line can differentiate into erythroid-lineage cells with EPO treatment ( Komatsu et al , Blood 89 : 4021 , 1997 ) .
We found that EPO did not activate Stat1alpha or Stat3 in UT-7/GM cells .
Transfection experiments showed that both Stat1alpha and Stat3 inhibited the induction by EPO of gamma-globin and erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthetase transcripts , resulting in a reduction of the percentage of hemoglobin-positive cells .
Dominant negative forms of Stat1alpha or Stat3 promoted the EPO-induced erythroid differentiation of UT-7/GM cells , even in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , although this cytokine never induced erythroid differentiation of the parent UT-7/GM cells with or without EPO .
A cell cycle analysis showed that the constitutive activation of Stat1alpha , but not Stat3 , shortened the period of G0/G1 prolongation caused by EPO stimulation .
Taken together , our data suggest that Stat1alpha and Stat3 act as negative regulators in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation .
Specifically , Stat1alpha may activate a cell cycle-associated gene ( s ) , leading to the entry of cells into the cell cycle .
Apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stresses can proceed via expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) and ligation of its receptor , Fas ( CD95 ) .
We report that activation of the two transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 is crucially involved in FasL expression induced by etoposide , teniposide , and UV irradiation .
A nondegradable mutant of I kappa B blocked both FasL expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but not Fas ligation .
These stimuli also induced the stress-activated kinase pathway ( SAPK/JNK ) , which was required for the maximal induction of apoptosis .
A 1.2 kb FasL promoter responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with p65 Rel or Fos/Jun .
Mutations in the relevant NF-kappa B and AP-1 binding sites eliminated these responses .
Thus , activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1 contributes to stress-induced apoptosis via the expression of FasL .
Activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) is essential for T cell receptor ( TCR ) responsiveness ; however , the function of individual PTK substrates is often uncertain .
A mutant T cell line was isolated that lacked expression of SLP-76 ( SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons ) , a hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein and PTK substrate .
SLP-76 was not required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins , but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 ( PLC-gamma1 ) , as well as Ras pathway activation .
TCR-inducible gene expression was dependent on SLP-76 .
Thus , coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76 .
Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood .
Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF-kappa B transcription factors .
U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen-binding integrins , predominately CD11b/CD18 , and to a lesser extent , CD11c/CD18 .
Cells stimulated with fibrinogen ( 10-100 microg/ml ) /Mn2+ ( 50 microM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
NF-kappa B activation , minimal in unstimulated cells , was substantially up-regulated by fibrinogen .
Fibrinogen also caused activation of AP-1 , but not SP1 or cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) factors .
Blocking mAbs against CD18 and CD11b abrogated fibrinogen-induced NF-kappa B activation .
To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 enhancer ( bearing two NF-kappa B sites ) coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter .
Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1 ) PMA for 24 h , inducing CAT activity by 2.6-fold , 2 ) fibrinogen/Mn2+ for 2 h , inducing CAT activity by 3.2-fold , or 3 ) costimulation with fibrinogen and PMA , inducing 5.7-fold the CAT activity induced by PMA alone .
We conclude that contact with fibrinogen-derived proteins may contribute to mononuclear phagocyte activation by signaling through CD11b/CD18 , resulting in selective activation of transcriptional regulatory factors , including NF-kappa B .
Exposure of cells to adverse environmental conditions invokes a genetically programmed series of events resulting in the induction of specific genes .
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin has recently been reported to upregulate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene induction .
In the present investigation , the effect of ciprofloxacin at supratherapeutic concentrations on immediate-early ( < 2 h ) gene expression in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied with Northern blots .
In addition , transcriptional activity of IL-2 and metallothionein enhancer and promoter regions and transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappaB , and NF-AT were analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , respectively .
The concentration of c-fos , c-jun , c-myc , junB , and fra-1 mRNAs was increased in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to that in untreated controls .
Ciprofloxacin increased CAT activity in stimulated lymphocytes transfected with plasmids containing either the IL-2 or metallothionein enhancer .
Furthermore , among the transcription factors tested , AP-1 activity was increased in stimulated purified T helper lymphocytes incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to drug-free controls .
Taken together , ciprofloxacin increased the levels of immediate-early transcripts , enhanced IL-2 and metallothionein promoter induction , and upregulated AP-1 concentrations in primary lymphocytes , reflecting a program commonly observed in mammalian stress responses .
The adoptive transfer of tumor-draining lymph node ( LN ) T cells activated ex vivo with anti-CD3 and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) mediates the regression of the poorly immunogenic murine melanoma D5 .
The efficacy of the activated LN cells is augmented when the sensitizing tumor is a genetically modified variant ( designated D5G6 ) that secretes granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor .
In contrast to anti-CD3/IL-2-activated LN cells , adoptive transfer of freshly isolated tumor-draining LN T cells has no therapeutic activity .
To determine whether the acquisition of antitumor function during ex vivo activation is associated with modifications in signal transduction capacity , the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and proteins of the NF-kappaB family were analyzed in tumor-draining LN T cells .
The levels of p56lck and p59fyn were lower in tumor-draining than in normal LN T cells and production of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates was markedly depressed following anti-CD3 stimulation .
After 5-day anti-CD3/IL-2 activation , levels of p56lck and p59fyn and protein tyrosine kinase activity increased .
Interestingly , the levels of p56lck , p59fyn , and tyrosine kinase activity were higher in activated T cells derived from LN that drained D5G6 than they were in those from D5 tumors .
In contrast , the cytoplasmic levels of c-Rel and Rel A were normal in freshly isolated tumor-draining LN , as was nuclear kappaB DNA-binding activity induced by anti-CD3 mAb or phorbol myristate acetate .
Stimulation of activated LN cells with D5 tumor cells induced the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB .
These findings indicate that the recovery of proteins mediating signal transduction through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex in LN T cells activated ex vivo was associated with the acquisition of antitumor function .
The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection .
The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses .
The antigens recognized by many HSV-specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown .
T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of HSV DNA are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions .
Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument protein VP22 and the viral dUTPase , encoded by genes UL49 and UL50 , respectively , are T-cell antigens .
Separate epitopes in VP22 were defined for T-cell clones from each of three patients .
Reactivity with the tegument protein encoded by UL21 was identified for an additional patient .
Three new epitopes were identified in VP16 , a tegument protein associated with VP22 .
Some tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV-infected cells .
These results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines .
The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent infection membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is a constitutively aggregated pseudo-tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) that activates transcription factor NF-kappaB through two sites in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain .
One site is similar to activated TNFRII in associating with TNFR-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2 , and the second site is similar to TNFRI in associating with the TNFRI death domain interacting protein TRADD .
TNFRI has been recently shown to activate NF-kappaB through association with TRADD , RIP , and TRAF2 ; activation of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) ; activation of the IkappaB alpha kinases ( IKKalpha and IKKbeta ) ; and phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha .
IkappaB alpha phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 is followed by its degradation and NF-kappaB activation .
In this report , we show that NF-kappaB activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites is mediated by a pathway that includes NIK , IKKalpha , and IKKbeta .
Dominant negative mutants of NIK , IKKalpha , or IKKbeta substantially inhibited NF-kappaB activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites .
Dithiocarbamates ( DTC ) , a diverse group of industrial and therapeutic chemicals , have been reported to inhibit , enhance or have no effect on the immune system .
These apparent inconsistencies reflect the complexity of the DTCs biological activities and are probably due in part to differences in dose , route of exposure , animal species used and/or specific compound tested .
The studies described herein were undertaken to investigate the immunotoxicity of one member of this family , dimethyldithiocarbamate ( DMDTC ) .
We demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB in primary human CD4+ T cells .
This inhibition is not accompanied by a loss in viability , and DMDTC-treated T cells retain other active signaling pathways throughout the exposure duration .
The inhibition of NF-kappaB is apparently permanent as DMDTC-treated T cells did not regain normal TNF-alpha activation , even after 72 h in culture .
DMDTC does not appear to alter NF-kappaB directly as pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with DMDTC does not diminish binding activity of this protein .
We further demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits intracellular IL-2 production and decreases surface expression of CD25 ( the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor ) in T cells stimulated with phorbol ester .
These data demonstrate that DMDTC is a potent immunosuppressive compound in vitro .
Expression of the CD95 ( APO-1/Fas ) ligand ( CD95L ) in activated T cells is a major cause of T cell activation-induced apoptosis .
To study the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control of CD95L expression in T cells , we investigated the human CD95L promoter in Jurkat T cells .
Deletion studies revealed that the CD95L proximal promoter sequence from -220 to the transcription start site is essential for T cell stimulation-induced expression of CD95L .
In this study , we discovered a novel regulatory element located at -120 of the CD95L promoter which contains DNA binding sites for SP-1 and a yet unknown inducible factor .
Mutation analysis demonstrated that binding of the inducible factor to the -120 region is crucial for the biological function of the CD95L promoter upon T cell stimulation .
The DNA sequence at -120 also contains two DNA motifs homologous to the binding site for NF-AT .
NF-AT does not directly bind to this element .
However , cotransfection studies with an NF-AT expression vector showed that NF-AT may confer a strong inducible activity to the CD95L promoter at this regulatory region .
Our data also show that the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A down-regulates CD95L transcription by inhibiting the function of this positive regulatory element .
The high concentration of foreign antigen in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is separated from the underlying lymphocytes by a single cell layer of polarized epithelium .
Intestinal epithelial cells can express HLA class II antigens and may function as antigen-presenting cells to CD4(+) T cells within the intestinal mucosa .
Using tetanus toxoid specific and HLA-DR-restricted T lymphocytes , we show that polarized intestinal epithelial cells directed to express HLA-DR molecules are able to initiate class II processing only after internalization of antigen from their apical surface .
Coexpression of the class II transactivator CIITA in these cells , which stimulates highly efficient class II processing without the characteristic decline in barrier function seen in polarized monolayers treated with the proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN , facilitates antigen processing from the basolateral surface .
In both cases , peptide presentation to T cells via class II molecules was restricted to the basolateral surface .
These data indicate a highly polarized functional architecture for antigen processing and presentation by intestinal epithelial cells , and suggest that the functional outcome of antigen processing by the intestinal epithelium is both dependent on the cellular surface at which the foreign antigen is internalized and by the underlying degree of mucosal inflammation .
The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure , gene transcription , specific cell fate development , and transformation .
We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated Rho ( V14Rho ) has little or no effect on NFAT , Oct-1 , and NF-kappaB enhancer element activities under similar conditions .
Overexpression of a V14Rho construct incapable of membrane localization ( CAAX deleted ) abolishes PMA-induced AP-1 transcriptional activation .
The effect of Rho on AP-1 is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , as a dominant-negative MEK and a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) did not affect Rho-induced AP-1 activity .
V14Rho binds strongly to protein kinase Calpha ( PKCalpha ) in vivo ; however , deletion of the CAAX site on V14Rho severely diminished this association .
Evidence for a role for PKCalpha as an effector of Rho was obtained by the observation that coexpression of the N-terminal domain of PKCalpha blocked the effects of activated Rho plus PMA on AP-1 transcriptional activity .
These data suggest that Rho potentiates AP-1 transcription during T-cell activation .
Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis without further requirement for TCR coengagement .
This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 ( costimulatory signal ) alone without signal 1 ( TCR signal ) can activate T cells .
To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3 .
Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ , but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1 .
This pathway resulted in the induction of the transcription factors NF-kappa B , NF-AT , and proteins binding to the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter .
On the other hand , stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1 , but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells , the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells ( p56(lck) activation , association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28 ) , indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation .
These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events .
Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors .
We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals .
In this study , we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene .
In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines , IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid .
The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced : upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases , transactivation by octamer , NF-kappa B , and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated , while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced .
Inducible nitric oxide ( iNO ) is produced at sites of vascular inflammation by resident and nonresident vascular wall cells , but its role in the inflammatory process is not known .
In this study , we show that a novel function of iNO is to terminate inflammatory processes .
We find that iNO produced by murine macrophage-like cells , RAW264.7 , can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation in a separated and mixed endothelial-RAW264.7 coculture system .
Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-gamma .
Inhibition of iNO synthase ( iNOS ) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures , stimulated with murine-specific IFN-gamma and LPS , decreased iNO production by 86 % , augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RAW264.7 cells , respectively , and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface .
Transient transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter constructs demonstrated that inhibitory effects of iNO on VCAM-1 gene transcription were mediated , in part , by inhibitory effects of iNO on kappa B cis-acting elements .
Immunofluorescence studies using an Ab to the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B revealed that iNO inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B .
These studies indicate that iNO attenuates iNOS expression in macrophages and inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells , and suggest that endogenously derived iNO may be an important autoregulatory inhibitor of vascular inflammation .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPAR ) control discrete genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism .
Recently , it was suggested that activation of the alpha isoform of PPAR by the potent proinflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) enhanced degradation of this eicosanoid , offersuggesting a new aspect of down-regulation of inflammation .
Here , we studied whether PPARalpha activation ( by means of the selective agonist WY 14,643 ) of endothelial cells , pivotal in the regulation of inflammatory responses , interfered with LTB4 induced adhesion of PMN neutrophil granulocytes in vitro .
When endothelial cells were treated with WY 14,643 prior to activation with LTB4 ( or fMLP , IL-1beta or TNFalpha , as controls ) we could not document any effect on the number of adhering PMN or duration of the response .
Thus , this study provides no evidence indicating a regulatory function of PPARalpha in LTB4 induced adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and neutrophils .
Cytokines , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-12 , and IL-15 are key regulators of human peripheral blood T and NK cell activation and differentiation but the precise mechanisms that give rise to their differential activities within these cells are not clear .
Recent studies reveal that a family of transcription factors , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) directly mediate many cytokine signals .
We analyzed the activation of STATs in primary human T and NK cells by a variety of specific cytokines .
We demonstrate that IL-12 induces STAT4 only in freshly isolated primary NK cells , but not in primary T cells , consistent with the lack of the IL-12 receptor in resting T cells .
In contrast , IL-4 induces different C epsilon GAS DNA-protein binding complexes in both T and NK cells .
Moreover , IL-4 costimulation with IL-2 or IL-12 does not alter their own preferential GAS-like DNA binding patterns when C epsilon- , Fc gamma RI- , and SIE GAS motif containing oligonucleotide probes are compared , suggesting that induction of GAS-like DNA-protein binding complexes by IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-12 is highly selective and represents one important factor in determining specific gene activation .
In addition , IL-6 and IL-2 synergistically induce homo- and heterodimerized STAT1 alpha and STAT3 in both NK and T cells , consistent with their reported synergism in modulating perforin gene expression .
We further demonstrated that IL-2 , -7 , and -15 induce multiple STAT proteins , including STAT5a , STAT5b , STAT1 alpha , STAT3 , and another unidentified Fc gamma RI GAS DNA-binding protein .
Finally , we observed that activated STAT5a and STAT5b proteins form distinct Fc gamma RI GAS binding patterns in T and NK cells , suggesting that they might have different roles in gene regulation .
Our data provide evidence that the differential responses in gene expression and cell activation seen in primary NK and T cells on direct stimulation with different cytokines may be a direct result of distinct activation of STAT transcription factors .
The small molecule S9a was derived from an established tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) inhibitor ( Canventol ) by replacement of the isopropylidine group with a phenyl ring .
S9a at 10 to 100 nM inhibited HIV production as potently as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine ( AZT ) , an inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptase .
Furthermore , S9a and AZT in combination , at noncytoxic concentrations strongly inhibited HIV-1 replication that was more than additive and substantially prolonged the appearance of virus both in acutely infected CD4+ lymphocytes ( SupT ) in culture and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) infected with a primary HIV-1 isolate .
S9a inhibited TNF-alpha promoter-driven reporter gene activity .
It was proposed that the mechanism of antiviral action of S9a was on the host cell , by blocking TNF-alpha transcription via a Tat-induced tar-independent loop , which decreases downstream NF-kappaB activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
S9a was superior to the first generation compound Canventol , which was superior to the natural compound sarcophytol A , demonstrating that further structure-based enhancement of potency of these compounds is feasible .
This study suggests a therapeutic approach against AIDS by application of two drugs , one against a cellular and the other a viral target , which may provide an approach to the problem of frequent emergence of resistant variants to combinations of drugs that target only HIV genes .
The entry of microorganisms into the body induces inflammatory processes .
During this process a sequence of cellular , humoral , non-specific and specific actions are evoked to combat the infection .
Macrophages and granulocytes , which are developed from a common progenitor cell , are the cellular components of the specific and non-specific immunoreaction .
MRP14 ( Macrophage migration inhibitory related protein ) and MRP8 , two S-100 proteins contained in high concentrations in these cells are obviously essential for adhesion and migration of monocytes and granulocytes .
To investigate the transcriptional regulation of these genes we cotransfected constructs expressing CAT under control of the MRP14 promoter and expression constructs of C/EBP alpha and v-myb , two transcription factors involved in myeloid/monocytic differentiation .
Transfection with C/EBP alpha revealed a massive enhancement of the MRP14 promoter in both , HL 60 cells ( granulocytic differentiated ) and L132 fibroblasts .
In contrast , v-myb reduces MRP14 promoter activity .
Northern blot analysis of L132 cells transfected with the C/EBP alpha expression vector demonstrate that C/EBP alpha is sufficient to enhance MRP14 expression in the context of the whole genome .
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia .
Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leukemogenesis is still unclear , the Tax protein is thought to play a major role in this process .
This 40-kDa polypeptide is able to interact with the tumor suppressor p16 ( INK4A ) .
Consequently , Tax can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of E2F that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle progression .
In this paper , we demonstrate that Tax can also activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16 ( INK4A ) .
Indeed , when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells , which lack expression of p16 ( INK4A ) , it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites .
This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F-binding sites .
In addition , Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself .
Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter , we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves , at least in part , the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter .
The mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of CyA and FK 506 can be monitored in vivo in humans .
The picture emerging is of a close relationship between drug concentrations and CN inhibition .
But many puzzles of the drugs remain .
What is the role of CyA in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , particularly in relationship to nephrotoxicity and fibrogenesis ?
How important are the anti-inflammatory ( non T ) effects of CyA , and which cells do they operate in ?
Are there effects of CyA and FK 506 all attributable to CN inhibition , and how much of them are mediated through the NFATC family of transcription factors ?
Finally , it would be useful to know what the inhibitory effects of CyA are on tolerance and negative regulatory events .
The estrogen-dependent and tissue-specific regulation of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin gene B1 promoter has been studied by lipid-mediated DNA transfer into Xenopus hepatocytes in primary culture .
Hepatocytes achieve an efficient hormonal control of this promoter through a functional interaction between the estrogen responsive elements and a promoter proximal region upstream of the TATA box , which is characterized by a high density of binding sites for the transcription factors CTF/NF-1 , C/EBP and HNF3 .
DNA accessibility to restriction enzymes within the chromosomal copy of the vitellogenin gene B1 promoter shows that the estrogen responsive unit and the promoter proximal region are sensitive to digestion in uninduced and estrogen-induced hepatocytes but not in erythrocyte nuclei .
Together , these findings support the notion that chromatin configuration as well as the interplay of promoter elements mediate proper hormone-dependent and tissue-specific expression of the B1 vitellogenin gene .
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was investigated in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 and resistant ICR27TK.3 human leukemic T cells .
Following glucocorticoid treatment of 6TG1.1 cells , chromatin fragmentation was observed after a delay of 24 h .
Fragmentation was not observed in ICR27TK.3 cells containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors ( L753F ) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress AP-1 activity .
Nor was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486 , indicating that repression of AP-1 activity is not involved .
As described in other systems , fragmentation required ongoing protein synthesis .
However , inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide anytime during the first 18 h of steroid treatment was as effective in blocking chromatin fragmentation as inhibition for the entire period , suggesting that synthesis of a component with a rapid turnover rate is required .
Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of immunoreactive IkappaB alpha in sensitive 6TG1.1 cells but not in resistant ICR27TK.3 cells .
In addition , mild detergent treatment of cell extracts indicated that a substantial amount of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB is complexed with IkappaB alpha or some other inhibitory factor .
These results suggest that induction of a labile inhibitory factor such as IkappaB alpha may contribute to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis .
We examined signaling molecules of peripheral blood T lymphocytes obtained from women with breast cancer .
In 6 of 14 patients , T lymphocytes displayed an impaired ability to translocate NFeB p65 ( Rel-A ) following activation by anti-CD3 and IL-2 .
This observation was made despite normal cytoplasmic levels of the Rel-A protein .
We also detected abnormally low levels of the signaling molecules T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -zeta , ZAP-70 and p56lck in 4 of 14 breast cancer patients , i.e. , defects in T-cell signaling molecules .
T lymphocytes from 6 of the 14 patients also exhibited an increased expression of the dual specificity phosphatase , map kinase phosphatase-1 ( MKP-1 ) .
MKP-1 inactivates MAP kinase and therefore may interfere with the activation of c-jun and c-fos .
Abnormalities of I or more signaling molecules were found in 9 of 14 patients ; however , only 3 patients had T cells that exhibited all 5 defects .
Our data have implications for the detection of potentially dysfunctional T cells in patients with cancer .
For example , the analysis of only 1 signaling molecule may allow patients with significant defects in T-cell signaling to go unnoticed .
Finally , despite impaired Rel-A translocation , T cells were capable of transcribing IL-2 .
Impairments in the translocation of Rel-B and c-Rel further suggest that the NFKB family members Rel-A , Rel-B and c-Rel are not required for the transcription of IL-2 in the peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with breast cancer .
We have determined how the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family ( pRb , p107 , and p130 ) is governed in individual cell cycle phases of Daudi B-cells during cell cycle exit triggered by alpha-interferon ( alpha-IFN ) .
alpha-IFN causes dephosphorylation of pRb and loss of p130 phosphorylated Form 3 .
However , the change in p130 phosphorylation in response to alpha-IFN occurs before dephosphorylation of pRb is complete because loss of p130 Form 3 occurs throughout the cell cycle prior to complete arrest in G1 , whereas pRb is dephosphorylated only in G1 .
In contrast , p107 is dephosphorylated and is then depleted from cells as they exit the cell cycle .
p130 , predominantly in Form 1 , and hypophosphorylated pRb bind an E2F DNA binding site ; p130 complexes E2F-4 , whereas pRb binds both E2F-4 and E2F-1 .
The phosphorylated forms of E2F-4 that bind to the E2F DNA site are different from hyperphosphorylated E2F-4 , which predominates in primary hemopoietic cells in G0 .
We conclude that although cell cycle arrest induced by alpha-IFN may be mediated in part by formation of a complex containing p130 and E2F-4 , alpha-IFN does not induce hyperphosphorylation of E2F-4 , which characterizes primary hemopoietic cells in G0 .
Transcription factors belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family regulate the expression of cytokine genes and other inducible genes during the immune response .
The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin- dependent phosphatase calcineurin .
Here we show that the binding of calcineurin to NFAT is substantially increased when calcineurin is activated with calmodulin and calcium .
FK506.FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of NFAT with activated calcineurin much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive calcineurin , suggesting that part of the interaction with activated calcineurin involved the enzyme active site .
We have previously shown that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin at a region distinct from the calcineurin active site ( Aramburu , J. , Garcia-Cozar , F. J. , Raghavan , A. , Okamura , H. , Rao , A. , and Hogan , P. G. ( 1998 ) Mol. Cell 1 , 627-637 ) ; this region is also involved in NFAT binding to activated calcineurin , since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site on NFAT .
The interacting surfaces are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain .
NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain was inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide , which bind in the calcineurin active site , as well as by the NFAT docking site peptide , which binds to a region of calcineurin distinct from the active site .
We propose that , in resting cells , NFAT is targeted to a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site .
Upon cell activation , displacement of the autoinhibitory domain by calmodulin binding allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site , thus positioning NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues .
The p56 Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation .
Hence in the absence of p56 , T cell receptor triggered activation does not occur .
We now provide evidence for a CD2-based signaling pathway which , in contrast to that of the T cell receptor , is independent of p56 .
CD2-mediated interleukin-2 production occurs via activation of Jun kinase in cell lines lacking p56 .
Jun kinase then facilitates the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the interleukin-2 promoter .
These data elucidate differences between TCR and CD2 signaling pathways in the same T cells .
Hemorrhagic shock ( HS ) initiates an inflammatory cascade that includes the production of cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils ( PMN ) and may progress to organ failure , inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) .
To examine the hypothesis that interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) contributes to PMN infiltration and lung damage in HS , we examined the lungs of rats subjected to unresuscitated and resuscitated HS for the production of IL-6 and activation of Stat3 .
Using semiquantitative RT-PCR , we found a striking increase in IL-6 mRNA levels only in resuscitated HS , with peak levels observed 1 h after initiation of resuscitation .
Increased IL-6 protein expression was localized to bronchial and alveolar cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of protein extracts from shock lungs exhibited an increase in Stat3 activation with kinetics similar to IL-6 mRNA .
In situ DNA binding assay determined Stat3 activation predominantly within alveoli .
Intratracheal instillation of IL-6 alone into normal rats resulted in PMN infiltration into lung interstitium and alveoli , marked elevation of bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity , and increased wet-to-dry ratio .
These findings indicate that IL-6 production and Stat3 activation occur early in HS and may contribute to PMN-mediated lung injury , including ARDS after HS .
The efficacy of o , o'-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide ( BMT ) was examined in detail against HIV-1 laboratory isolates ( HTLV-IIIB , JRFL , and MN ) , primary isolates ( KMT and KMO ) , and simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIVmac251 ) in vitro .
BMT inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in both laboratory and primary isolates in vitro .
In addition , BMT exhibited antiviral activity against SIVmac251 .
Minimizing energy studies of BMT structure reveal that a trans-disulfide of thiamine ( holo drug ) disulfide ( TDS , protodrug ) is allosterically transited to the reactive twisted disulfide of BMT ( allo drug ) by o , o'-bismyristoyl esterification of TDS .
BMT inhibits nuclear translocation of both HIV-1 transactivator ( TAT ) and the cellular transcriptional nuclear factor-KB ( NF-kappa B ) , resulting in the suppression of HIV-1 replication .
In this study we report on the establishment and characterization of two novel lymphoma cell lines ( CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 ) which carry infection by human herpesvirus type-8 ( HHV-8 ) and have derived from AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) .
These two cell lines are representative of different virologic subtypes of PEL , i.e. HHV-8+/EBV- PEL in the case of CRO-AP/3 and HHV-8+/EBV+ PEL in the case of CRO-AP/5 .
Consistent with the diagnosis of PEL , both CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 expressed indeterminate ( i.e. non-B , non-T ) phenotypes although immunogenotypic studies documented their B-cell origin .
Both cell lines are devoid of genetic lesions of c-MYC , BCL-2 and p53 as well as gross rearrangements of BCL-6 .
Detailed histogenetic characterization of these novel PEL cell lines suggests that PEL may derive from a post-germinal centre B cell which has undergone pre-terminal differentiation .
The CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 cell lines may provide a valuable model for clarifying the pathogenesis of PEL .
In particular , these cell lines may help understand the relative contribution of HHV-8 and EBV to PEL growth and development and may facilitate the identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities highlighting putative novel cancer related loci relevant to PEL .
A new human leukemia cell line with an eosinophilic phenotype , designated YJ , was established from the peripheral blood cells of a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMMoL ) with eosinophilia .
When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , most YJ cells were myeloblastoid with a small number of the cells having eosinophilic granules .
Cell surface markers in the YJ cells were positive for CD33 and were negative for CD34 , CD16 and CD23 .
The eosinophilic characteristics of YJ cells were confirmed by histochemical staining with Fast-Green/Neutral-Red and by the expression of mRNAs for eosinophil-associated granule proteins , eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin ( EDN ) , eosinophil peroxidase ( EPO ) , and major basic protein ( MBP ) , and for the Charcot-Leyden crystal ( CLC ) protein .
The YJ cells could be induced towards monocytic differentiation by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
The monocytic characteristics of YJ cells treated with PMA were confirmed by morphological analysis with alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining , by CD14 expression , and by increased expression of Egr-1 mRNA .
Furthermore , YJ cells could be differentiated towards the neutrophil lineage by stimulation with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) .
YJ cells treated in vitro with 2 microM RA differentiated into metamyelocytes and band neutrophils , and increased the number of nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) -positive cells and increased gp91phox mRNA expression .
Thus , the YJ cell line exhibited eosinophilic characteristics , but was able to differentiate to the monocytic or neutrophilic lineages in response to PMA or RA , respectively .
The expression of genes for transcription factors involved in myeloid differentiation was evaluated by Northern blot analysis .
Increased expression of Egr-1 was observed with macrophage differentiation .
In contrast , increased expressions of C/EBPbeta and MZF-1 mRNA occurred with neutrophilic differentiation .
The YJ cell line should be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing lineage switching from the eosinophil to monocytic or neutrophil lineages .
Cytokines stimulate granulopoiesis through signaling via receptors whose expression is controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors .
Previously , we demonstrated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor mRNA was undetectable and granulocyte maturation blocked in CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha ( C/EBPalpha ) -deficient mice .
This phenotype is distinct from that of G-CSF receptor-/- mice , suggesting that other genes are likely to be adversely affected by loss of C/EBPalpha .
Here we demonstrate loss of interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) receptor and IL-6-responsive colony-forming units ( CFU-IL6 ) in C/EBPalpha-/- mice .
The observed failure of granulopoiesis could be rescued by the addition of soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 or by retroviral transduction of G-CSF receptors , demonstrating that loss of both of these receptors contributes to the absolute block in granulocyte maturation observed in C/EBPalpha-deficient hematopoietic cells .
The results of these and other studies suggest that additional C/EBPalpha target genes , possibly other cytokine receptors , are also important for the block in granulocyte differentiation observed in vivo in C/EBPalpha-deficient mice .
When human monocytes or alveolar macrophages are cultured in the presence of interleukin ( IL ) -4 or IL-13 , the expression of the reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase is induced .
In mice a 15-lipoxygenase is not expressed , but a leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase is present in peritoneal macrophages .
To investigate whether both lipoxygenase isoforms exhibit a similar regulatory response toward cytokine stimulation , we studied the regulation of the leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase of murine peritoneal macrophages by interleukins and found that the activity of this enzyme is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were cultured in the presence of the IL-4 or IL-13 but not by IL-10 .
When peripheral murine monocytes that do not express the lipoxygenase were treated with IL-4 expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase mRNA was induced , suggesting pretranslational control mechanisms .
In contrast , no upregulation of the lipoxygenase activity was observed when the macrophages were prepared from homozygous STAT6-deficient mice .
Peritoneal macrophages of transgenic mice that systemically overexpress IL-4 exhibited a threefold to fourfold higher 12-lipoxygenase activity than cells prepared from control animals .
A similar upregulation of 12-lipoxygenase activity was detected in heart , spleen , and lung of the transgenic animals .
Moreover , a strong induction of the enzyme was observed in red cells during experimental anemia in mice .
The data presented here indicate that ( 1 ) the 12-lipoxygenase activity of murine macrophages is upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IL-4 and/or IL-13 , ( 2 ) this upregulation requires expression of the transcription factor STAT6 , and ( 3 ) the constitutive expression of the enzyme appears to be STAT6 independent .
The cytokine-dependent upregulation of the murine macrophage 12-lipoxygenase and its induction during experimental anemia suggests its close relatedness with the human reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase despite their differences in the positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation .
Human neutrophils can be induced to actively transcribe a number of early-response genes , in particular those encoding cytokines , chemokines , and the high-affinity surface receptor for IgG , FcgammaRI .
Although little is known to date about the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , several indications point to a role for distinct transcription factors , such as members of the NF-kappaB and STAT families .
In this study , we investigated whether these transcription factors become activated under stimulatory conditions which are known to induce gene transcription in neutrophils .
Unexpectedly , we found that conventional procedures employed to prepare cellular extracts cause the release of proteolytic activities that are normally stored in intracellular granules , resulting in the degradation of various NF-kappaB/Rel and STAT proteins .
To circumvent this problem , we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils , LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of p50/RelA dimers , and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter .
Moreover , we report that neutrophil stimulation with GM-CSF results in the formation of a STAT5-containing DNA-binding activity .
Collectively , the current findings open new perspectives about mechanisms that are likely to regulate gene transcription in neutrophils .
In addition , the procedure described herein could prove useful in other cell types that express high levels of endogenous proteases .
Chromosomal translocations involving the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the Pebp2/Cbf transcription factor have been associated with human acute myeloid leukemia and the preleukemic condition , myelodysplasia .
Inv(16)(p13;q22) fuses the gene encoding the beta subunit of Pebp2 to the MYH11 gene encoding a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( Smmhc ) .
To examine the effect of the inv(16)(p13;q22) on myelopoiesis , we used the hMRP8 promoter element to generate transgenic mice expressing the Pebp2beta Smmhc chimeric fusion protein in myeloid cells .
Neutrophil maturation was impaired in PEBP2betaMYH11 transgenic mice .
Although the transgenic mice had normal numbers of circulating neutrophils , their bone marrow contained increased numbers of immature neutrophilic cells , which exhibited abnormal characteristics .
In addition , PEBP2betaMYH11 inhibited neutrophilic differentiation in colonies derived from hematopoietic progenitors .
Coexpression of both PEBP2betaMYH11 and activated NRAS induced a more severe phenotype characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology indicative of granulocytic dysplasia .
These results show that PEBP2betaMYH11 can impair neutrophil development and provide evidence that alterations of Pebp2 can contribute to the genesis of myelodysplasia .
NFAT regulates transcription of a number of cytokine and other immunoregulatory genes .
We have isolated NFATx , which is one of four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors and is preferentially expressed in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes , and an isoform of NFATx , NFATx1 .
Here we provide evidence showing that 15 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal end of NFATx1 are required for its maximum transactivation activity in Jurkat T cells .
A fusion between these 15 amino acids and the GAL4 DNA binding domain was capable of transactivating reporters driven by the GAL4 DNA binding site .
Interestingly , this 15-amino acid transactivation sequence is well conserved in NFAT family proteins , although the sequences contiguous to the carboxyl-terminal regions of the NFAT family are much less conserved .
We also report three additional isoforms of NFATx , designated NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 .
This transactivation sequence is altered by tissue-specific alternative splicing in newly isolated NFATx isoforms , resulting in lower transactivation activity in Jurkat T cells .
NFATx1 is expressed predominantly in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocyte , while the skeletal muscle expressed primarily NFATx2 .
In Jurkat cells , transcription from the NFAT site of the IL-2 promoter is activated strongly by NFATx1 but only weakly by NFATx2 .
These data demonstrate that the 15-amino acid sequence of NFATx1 is a major transactivation sequence required for induction of genes by NFATx1 in T cells and possibly regulates NFAT activity through tissue-specific alternative splicing .
Despite overwhelming evidence that enhanced production of the p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( p75TNF-R ) accompanies development of specific human inflammatory pathologies such as multi-organ failure during sepsis , inflammatory liver disease , pancreatitis , respiratory distress syndrome , or AIDS , the function of this receptor remains poorly defined in vivo .
We show here that at levels relevant to human disease , production of the human p75TNF-R in transgenic mice results in a severe inflammatory syndrome involving mainly the pancreas , liver , kidney , and lung , and characterized by constitutively increased NF-kappaB activity in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell compartment .
This process is shown to evolve independently of the presence of TNF , lymphotoxin alpha , or the p55TNF-R , although coexpression of a human TNF transgene accelerated pathology .
These results establish an independent role for enhanced p75TNF-R production in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease and implicate the direct involvement of this receptor in a wide range of human inflammatory pathologies .
The expression of the murine interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor alpha chain/CD25 is strongly induced at the transcriptional level after T cell activation .
We show here that nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) factors are involved in the control of CD25 promoter induction in T cells .
NF-ATp and NF-ATc bind to two sites around positions -585 and -650 located upstream of the proximal CD25 promoter .
Immediately 3' from these NF-AT motifs , nonconsensus sites are located for the binding of AP-1-like factors .
Mutations of sites that suppress NF-AT binding impair the induction and strong NF-ATp-mediated transactivation of the CD25 promoter in T cells .
In T lymphocytes from NF-ATp-deficient mice , the expression of CD25 is severely impaired , leading to a delayed IL-2 receptor expression after T cell receptor ( TCR ) /CD3 stimulation .
Our data indicate an important role for NF-AT in the faithful expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors and a close link between the TCR-mediated induction of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor alpha chain promoters , both of which are regulated by NF-AT factors .
Cepharanthine is a biscoclaurine alkaloid isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata and has been shown to have antiinflammatory , antiallergic , and immunomodulatory activities in vivo .
As several inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stresses are involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection , we investigated the inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) - and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced HIV-1 replication in chronically infected cell lines .
Two chronically HIV-1-infected cell lines , U1 ( monocytic ) and ACH-2 ( T lymphocytic ) , were stimulated with TNF-alpha or PMA and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of the compound .
HIV-1 replication was determined by p24 antigen level .
The inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -driven gene expression and nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activation were also examined .
Cepharanthine dose dependently inhibited HIV-1 replication in TNF-alpha- and PMA-stimulated U1 cells but not in ACH-2 cells .
Its 50 % effective and cytotoxic concentrations were 0.016 and 2.2 microg/ml in PMA-stimulated U1 cells , respectively .
Cepharanthine was found to suppress HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation .
These results indicate that cepharanthine is a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in a chronically infected monocytic cell line .
Since biscoclaurine alkaloids , containing cepharanthine as a major component , are widely used for the treatment of patients with various inflammatory diseases in Japan , cepharanthine should be further pursued for its chemotherapeutic potential in HIV-1-infected patients .
Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is highly dependent on the state of activation of the infected cells and is modulated by interactions between viral and host cellular factors .
Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , a pleiotropic immunomodulatory molecule , is observed at elevated levels during HIV-1 infection as well as during the course of other pathogenic infections .
In 1G5 , a Jurkat-derived T cell line stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , we found that PGE2 markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR-mediated reporter gene activity .
Experiments have been conducted to identify second messengers involved in this PGE2-dependent up-regulating effect on the regulatory element of HIV-1 .
In this study , we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE2 necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP , protein kinase A , and Ca2+ .
Experiments conducted with different HIV-1 LTR-based vectors suggested that PGE2-mediated activation effect on HIV-1 transcription was transduced via both NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways .
The involvement of NF-kappaB in the PGE2-dependent activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was further confirmed using a kappaB-regulated luciferase encoding vector and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Results from Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses , as well as the use of a selective antagonist indicated that PGE2 modulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity in studied T lymphoid cells is transduced via the EP4 receptor subtype .
These results suggest that secretion of PGE2 by macrophages in response to infection or inflammatory activators could induce signaling events resulting in activation of proviral DNA present into T cells latently infected with HIV-1 .
The products of the tumor suppressor genes are considered to function as specific inhibitors of tumor cell growth .
In this communication , we present evidence to show that these proteins inhibit tumor cell proliferation by participating in the activation of tumor cell differentiation .
The ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells used in this study proliferate when treated with insulin-like growth factor I and transferrin but differentiate to monocytes when exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha or transforming growth factor beta1 , or to macrophage-like cells when treated with both these cytokines .
Initiation of proliferation but not of differentiation was followed by a 20- to 25-fold increase in the nuclear level of the DNA polymerase-associated processivity factor PCNA and of the proliferation-specific transcription factor E2F1 .
In contrast , induction of differentiation but not of proliferation was followed by a 25- to 30-fold increase in the nuclear level of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 ( wild type ) , pRb , and p130/Rb2 and of the p53-dependent cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 .
p53 and p21/Cip1 , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of PCNA , whereas p130 and pRb , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of E2F1 .
As a result , G1-S-associated DNA and mRNA synthesis is inhibited , growth uncoupled from differentiation , and maturation enabled to proceed .
Where this function of the tumor suppressor proteins is impaired , the capacity for differentiation is lost , which leads to the sustained proliferation that is characteristic of the cancer cell .
We describe the embryonic expression of musculin , a new murine member of the bHLH family of transcription factors .
Musculin protein is closely related to human ABF-1 , which is expressed in activated B cells , and to epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 , which is expressed in branchial myoblasts , visceral and urogenital mesoderm and epicardium .
In situ hybridisation revealed musculin expression in embryos was largely restricted to the embryonic skeletal muscle lineage .
While all skeletal muscles expressed the gene , only a subset of myocytes within each muscle were positive , indicating molecular heterogeneity within fetal muscle .

BACKGROUND : Recent data suggest that the regulation of class switching to IgE by cytokines is mediated by STAT transcription factors .
The induction of IgE by IL-4 and IL-13 occurs through the activation of the intracellular signal-transducing protein Stat6 , whereas the inhibition of IgE class switching by interferon-y ( IFN-gamma ) occurs through the activation of Statl .
OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that in extrinsic asthma or in cases of markedly elevated IgE ( ie , hyperimmunoglobulin E [ HIE ] ) increased levels of IgE may be associated with alterations in the cytokine levels or the activation of Stat6 .
METHODS : PBMCs and sera from 8 patients with extrinsic asthma ( mean IgE , 285+/-100 IU/mL ) , 3 patients with HIE ( mean IgE , 7050+/-1122 IU/mL ) , and 14 nonatopic control subjects ( mean IgE , 112+/-28 IU/mL ) were analyzed .
RESULTS : The mean IL-4 level detected by ELISA was much greater in patients with HIE than control subjects ( 88.6+/-11.5 pg/mL vs 11.5+/-7.1 pg/mL , P = .005 ) , and increased IL-4 levels among patients with both asthma and HIE correlated with the increased IgE levels .
In contrast , IL-13 levels were not elevated .
Levels of Stat6 protein present in PBMCs did not differ in the patients and control subjects .
Examination of Stat6 DNA-binding activity demonstrated no activation of IL-4 signaling in patients with either HIE or acute asthma .
Interestingly , evidence for the presence of B cells that have already switched to IgE was seen in PBMCs of several patients with asthma or HIE .
CONCLUSION : These results indicate that ( 1 ) IgE production in asthma and HIE usually is associated with elevated levels of IL-4 , but not IL-13 , in the peripheral blood ; ( 2 ) the increased sera IL-4 levels in asthma and HIE are not sufficient to induce Stat6 activation in PBMCs ; and ( 3 ) evidence of switch recombination to epsilon may be detected in isolated cases of elevated IgE .
This implies that high levels of IgE in these patients either results from B cells that have already undergone class switching , from Ig class switching that is localized to target tissues , or both .
It has been proposed that the cross-priming of CTL responses in vivo involves the transfer to host APCs of heat shock protein glycoprotein 96-chaperoned antigenic peptides released from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) of dying or infected cells .
We have tested this possibility directly using TAP-deficient cell lines lacking antigenic ER peptides derived from two model Ags , the human adenovirus type 5 early regions E1A and E1B .
Although both proteins were well expressed , the cells were not recognized by E1A- or E1B-specific CTLs unless the relevant epitope was either provided exogenously as a synthetic peptide or targeted to the ER in a TAP-independent fashion .
Despite the absence of these ER peptides , the TAP1-/- cells were able to efficiently cross-prime E1A- and E1B-specific CTLs following immunization of syngeneic mice .
These results indicate that , although purified peptide/glycoprotein 96 complexes are potent immunogens , the mechanism of CTL cross-priming in vivo does not depend upon antigenic peptides in the ER of immunizing cells .
We report an unusual case of a 55 year old Japanese woman with a seminoma but relatively normal menses .
The patient was a phenotypic female with late onset menarche ( 18 years of age ) , who was amenorrhoeic for the first year , followed by menses of one to three days ' slight flow with dysmenorrhoea , but an otherwise normal menstrual history .
A typical seminoma was removed from the left adnexal region and an immature testis was identified separately as an associated right adnexal mass .
Repeated karyotypic studies on peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures showed only 46,X,-Y,t(Y;15)(q12;p13) .
Cytogenetic examination of the patient 's younger brother , who had fathered three healthy children , showed an identical karyotype .
Mosaicism of 46,X,-Y,t(Y;15)(q12;p13)/45,X cell lines was found in skin samples from the patient 's elbow and genital regions , although there were no clinical stigmata of Turner syndrome .
An androgen receptor binding assay of cultured genital skin fibroblasts was negative .
Molecular analysis using Southern blot hybridisation , PCR , and direct DNA sequencing showed that neither the patient nor her brother had a detectable deletion or other abnormalities of Y chromosome sequences , including the SRY ( sex determining region of the Y chromosome ) gene sequence .
These findings suggest that Turner mosaicism of the 45,X cell line may have contributed to this atypical presentation in an XY female , although we can not exclude abnormalities of other genes related to sex differentiation .
The chemokine receptor , BLR1 , is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of B cells in lymphoid organs .
In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA-less blr1 core promoter that confer cell type- and differentiation-specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice , a functional promoter region ( -36 with respect to the transcription start site ) , a NF-kappaB motif ( +44 ) , and a noncanonical octamer motif ( +157 ) .
The importance of these sites was confirmed by in vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either Oct-2 , Bob1 , or both NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p52 .
In all of these animals , the expression of BLR1 was reduced or absent .
In mice deficient only of p52/NF-kappaB , BLR1 expression was unaffected .
Thus our data demonstrate that BLR1 is a target gene for Oct-2 , Bob1 , and members of the NF-kappaB/Rel family and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors .
Coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) catalyzes the sixth step of the heme biosynthetic pathway .
To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the CPO gene promoter , mouse genomic DNA clones for CPO were isolated .
Structural analysis demonstrated that the mouse CPO gene spans approximately 11 kb and consists of seven exons , just like its human counterpart .
Functional analysis of the promoter by transient transfection assays indicated that synergistic action between an SP-1-like element at -21/-12 , a GATA site at -59/-54 , and a novel regulatory element , CPRE ( -GGACTACAG- ) at -49/-41 , is essential for the promoter activity in murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells .
In nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells , however , the GATA site is not required .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed with each element , and that there are cell-specific differences in factors , which bind to the SP-1-like element between MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
These results provide evidence for differential regulation of the promoter function of CPO gene between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .

Proliferative and secretory responses in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells are regulated by steroid and peptide hormones and by differentiation-promoting substances .
In the present study , we evaluated whether peripheral blood monocytes that exhibit anti-tumour activity in haematopoietic and solid tumours influence growth and secretion in the LNCaP cell line .
For this purpose , LNCaP cells were incubated with monocyte-conditioned medium ( MCM ) , and proliferation as well as expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) and secretion of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) were assessed .
Conditioned medium from monocytes reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner .
Incubation with 40 % MCM caused a 50 % reduction in cell proliferation .
AR protein decreased by 70 % and PSA levels in supernatants from LNCaP cells were reduced by approximately 80 % following treatment with MCM .
We focused on the contribution of two major products of activated monocytes , prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 1beta ( IL-1beta ) , to the MCM modulatory action .
LNCaP cells treated with prostaglandin E2 showed neither a reduction in proliferation nor a down-regulation of AR and PSA levels .
The effects of MCM on cellular proliferation , AR protein and PSA secretion were abolished by pretreatment of MCM with a neutralizing anti-IL-1beta antibody .
In addition , recombinant IL-1beta was able to replace MCM for the inhibition of proliferation and down-regulation of AR and PSA proteins .
LNCaP cells were shown to express the IL-1beta receptor type 1 , which transduces IL-1beta signal .
Our findings reveal that monocyte-derived IL-1beta inhibits the proliferation of androgen-responsive prostate tumour cells and reduces AR and PSA levels .
A recent clinical therapeutic initiative has been the use of chemical agents which induce the leukaemic cells to overcome their block in differentiation .
In order to understand this block the cascade of molecular events needs to be characterized .
Haemopoietic differentiation is ultimately controlled at the level of gene transcription which is mediated by an array of transcription factors .
Many transcription factors contain similar structural protein sequences , and we have used an RT-PCR-based approach to isolate sequences , from transcription factor gene families which share similar domains .
Degenerate primers corresponding to the TFIIIA zinc-finger consensus amino acid sequences and to the POU-homeodomain and POU-specific domain were used to amplify genes on the basis that they contained similarities in structural motifs shared within these families of transcription factors .
A serum-independent HL60 cell line was induced towards the neutrophil lineage by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) for 24 h .
CD38+ cells committed towards this lineage were enriched and a population of these cells treated with dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce neutrophil maturation .
RNA extracted from uninduced , ATRA-induced CD38+ cells , and vitamin D3 treated maturing cell cultures were amplified using the degenerate primers .
PCR fragments were cloned , sequenced , clustered into homologous groups , and the group sequences searched on the GenBank database .
The Oct 1 transcription factor , and a very close homologue , KIAA0144 , was identified using the POU family primers .
The zinc-finger primers identified three zinc-finger genes .
The pattern of gene expression was suggested from the number of clones in each group at neutrophil commitment and maturation .
The differential expression of the genes in the zinc finger and POU families will lead to a better understanding of the cascade of gene expression which occurs following ATRA-induced differentiation .
The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) plays an important role in T-cell biology .
Activation of T cells results in the rapid calcineurin-dependent translocation of NFAT transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus .
This translocation process coupled to the subsequent active maintenance of NFAT in the nucleus compartment is critical for the induction of expression of several genes encoding cytokines and membrane proteins that modulate immune responses .
The molecular cloning of the NFAT family of transcription factors has facilitated rapid progress in the understanding of the signalling mechanisms that control the activity of NFAT .
MHC class II expression was examined in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis .
IFN-gamma increased the surface expression of class II molecules in THP-1 cells and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M. tuberculosis .
Despite this effect , steady state levels of HLA-DRalpha , HLA-DRbeta , and invariant ( Ii ) chains were equivalent in control and infected cells .
Metabolic labeling combined with pulse-chase experiments and biochemical analysis showed that the majority of class II molecules in infected cells became resistant to endoglycosidase H , consistent with normal Golgi processing .
However , results of intracellular staining and dual color confocal microscopy revealed a significant defect in transport of newly synthesized class II molecules through the endocytic compartment .
Thus , compared with findings in control cells , class II molecules in infected cells colocalized to a minimal extent with a lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1+ endosomal compartment .
In addition , in contrast to control cells , class II molecules in infected cells failed to colocalize with endocytosed BSA under conditions where this marker is known to label late endosomes , lysosomes , and the MHC class II compartment .
Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway , the maturation of SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers -- dependent upon removal of Ii chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment -- was markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis-infected cells .
These findings indicate that defective transport and processing of class II molecules through the endosomal/lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of MHC class II molecules in cells infected with M. tuberculosis .
Work reported over the past year has provided insights into the mechanisms whereby ligand activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) regulates systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis .
PPARgamma has also been implicated recently in the biology of monocytes and in cell-cycle regulation and cancer .
Polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids bind and activate PPARgamma , suggesting that these lipids may serve as hormonal regulators of a variety of biological processes .
Studies have demonstrated abnormalities of the CD3/T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) and pathways of signal transduction in T lymphocytes from animals and patients with advanced malignancy .
Diminished expression of TCRzeta and p56(lck) that are associated with the TCR and reduced nuclear localization of RelA containing nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) complexes have been noted .
These defects have been described in T cells from patients with malignant melanoma , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , ovarian cancer , and colorectal cancer .
Preliminary observations also indicate possible correlation with clinical variables such as stage in selected instances .
To further characterize altered expression of TCRzeta , p56(lck) , and impaired activation of NFkappaB , T lymphocytes were obtained from 65 patients with RCC , the majority of whom were receiving combination cytokine therapy [ interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IFN alpha-containing regimens ] and 37 control individuals .
In 29 of these patients , levels of TCRzeta and p56(lck) were determined by Western blots of T-cell lysates and semiquantitated using densitometry .
Relative levels were then correlated with a series of clinical variables including response to therapy , performance status , survival , disease sites , age , and others .
In another group of 28 patients ( three individuals from the first group ) , the frequency of abnormal NFkappaB activation was studied using electrophoretic mobility shift assays after activation of T cells with phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody .
Changes in these signaling molecules during cytokine treatment were also investigated .
TCRzeta and p56(lck) were detected in the peripheral blood T cells in 27 of 29 patients , and overall , reduced levels were noted visually in 12 of 29 ( 41 % ) and 13 of 29 ( 45 % ) individuals , respectively .
When levels were semiquantitated using densitometry , significant decreases of TCRzeta ( P = 0.029 ) and p56(lck) ( P = 0.029 ) but not CD3epsilon ( P = 0.131 ) , compared with control levels , were found .
In patients treated with IL-2/IFN alpha-based therapy , relative levels of TCRzeta increased significantly ( P = 0.002 ) on day 15 of cycle one compared with the baseline .
Correlations of TCRzeta or p56(lck) levels with response or disease variables , except for lower TCRzeta levels ( P < 0.001 ) in the presence of bone metastases , were not found .
Abnormal NFkappaB activation after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin and/or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was found in 59 % of patients ( 17 of 28 ) and was not accounted for by the advanced age of the study cohort .
Activation of NFkappaB in peripheral blood T cells was inducible during cytokine therapy in four of six individuals who displayed impaired NFkappaB activity prior to therapy .
Moreover , impaired activation of NFkappaB does not appear linked to a reduction of TCRzeta expression , because in five patients , normal TCRzeta levels were present although kappaB binding was not inducible .
In the majority of patients with advanced RCC , peripheral blood T cells express TCRzeta and p56(lck) , and in a subset , reduced levels of these TCRzeta associated molecules are seen that may increase during cytokine-based therapy .
Abnormal activation of NFkappaB is also present in > 50 % of patients and may also revert to normal during IL-2/IFN alpha-based treatment .
This alteration in NFkappaB activation occurred in the presence of normal expression of TCRzeta-associated signaling elements .
The clinical significance of these findings remains unclear .
To study the regulatory mechanism of gp91phox gene expression in eosinophils , we transiently transfected eosinophil-committed HL-60-C15 cells with gp91phox promoter constructs , and identified a negative element from bp -267 to -246 of the gp91phox gene , the deletion of which caused an 83 % increase in promoter activity .
Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated GATA-3 binds to the GATA consensus site from bp -256 to -250 .
An 81 % increment in promoter activity was obtained when a mutation was introduced in the GATA-3 binding site of the bp -267 to +12 construct , which is comparable to that of the bp -245 to +12 construct .
We therefore conclude that GATA-3 specifically binding to the GATA site negatively regulates the expression of the gene in HL-60-C15 cells .
IL-12 is a 75-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of two covalently linked p35 and p40 chains .
This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a prominent role in the development of Th1 cell-mediated immune responses .
Th1 cell-mediated immune responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases .
Thus , IL-12 appears to be a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory conditions .
In this study , we investigated the effects of a commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory drug , acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) , on IL-12 production and Th1 cell development .
ASA was found to inhibit secretion of the IL-12 heterodimer as well as p40 monomer by human monocytic cells .
This was associated with the down-regulation of IL-12p40 mRNA expression .
Analysis of the regulation of the p40 gene promoter revealed that ASA inhibited NF-kappaB activation and binding to the p40-kappaB site in the p40 promoter , leading to transcriptional repression of the p40 gene .
Addition of ASA to an in vitro T helper cell differentiation system , at concentrations compatible with plasma levels reached during anti-inflammatory therapy , resulted in reduced development of Th1 cells .
These results suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by ASA leads to down-regulation of IL-12 production and inhibition of Th1 cell development .
The gene encoding a chicken cytokine with T-cell proliferative activity was cloned , sequenced , and mapped .
The results show that this cytokine is chicken IL2 and not IL15 .
The exon:intron structure of chicken IL2 corresponds almost exactly to those of mammalian IL2s with the exceptions of exon 2 and introns 2 and 3 which are shorter .
Chicken IL2 contains five repeats of the " instability " motif ATTTA in the 3' untranslated region in exon 4 .
It is a single-copy gene , with neither structural ( amino acid ) nor promoter sequence polymorphisms identified .
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggests that overall protein structure is conserved , but the receptor binding sites are not .
A number of potential regulatory sequences similar to those found in mammals have been identified in the promoter .
These include ( 5'-3' ) a composite NF-AT/ " AP-1 " element , a CD28 response element , an AP-1 element , an NF-AT element , and the AP-1 part of an AP-1/octamer composite element .
The mammalian NF-kappaB and octamer binding sites seem to be absent , although there are alternative potential NF-kappaB and octamer-binding elements in the chicken IL2 promoter , in close proximity to their mammalian homologues .
Sequence comparisons also predict other potential transcription factor binding sites as yet undescribed in mammalian IL2 promoters .
A Taq I polymorphism was identified which enabled chicken IL2 to be mapped to chromosome 4 , linked to ANX5 , with synteny with mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4 .
This is the first non-mammalian cytokine gene to be mapped .
C-fos has been reported to be one of the immediate early genes in signal transduction systems after many kinds of stresses , including ionizing radiation .
Changes in c-fos expression induced by radiation therapy in tumor tissues have not yet been reported .
In this study , we have attempted to determine whether c-fos expression is induced by radiotherapy in human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to establish a possible correlation between c-fos expression and the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy .
Twenty-seven patients with tumors of the oral cavity , oropharynx , and maxillary sinus were examined , all of which were confirmed as squamous cell carcinomas .
After obtaining the patients ' informed consent , biopsies were performed before treatment and at doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy of radiotherapy , and the specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen for further examination .
Serial sectioning of 6 micrometer was performed using a cryostat , and samples were immunohistochemically stained using the streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method and a monoclonal antibody against c-fos .
Three of the 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma showed slight expression of c-fos in their tumor cells before and/or at 4 or 10 Gy of radiotherapy .
The tumors showed high radiosensitivity .
Concerning tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , the rate of moderate or remarkable grades of c-fos-positive lymphocytes before radiotherapy and at radiation doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy was 8.0 , 29.2 , 4.8 , and 0 % , respectively .
The relationship between the immunohistochemical findings and the antitumor effect at a radiation dose of 20 Gy was examined on the corresponding H & E-stained sections .
In patients whose infiltration of c-fos-positive lymphocytes into tumor tissues were moderate or remarkable at 4 Gy of radiotherapy , the tumors responded significantly well to radiation therapy ( P < 0.025 , chi2 test ) , and the patients took a significantly favorable clinical course ( P < 0.05 , chi2 test ) .
In a sample from one of the patients , c-fos-positive lymphocytes were identified as CD4 positive and CD8 negative .
Therefore , the high radiosensitivity of squamous cell carcinomas in our samples could be explained by an overexpression of c-fos in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes induced by small doses of radiation therapy , and these activated lymphocytes exerted a cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells .
The beta-casein promoter has been widely used to monitor the activation of STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) 5 since STAT5 was originally found as a mediator of PRL-inducible beta-casein expression .
However , not only is expression of the beta-casein gene regulated by STAT5 but it is also affected by other molecules such as glucocorticoid and Ras .
In this report , we describe the transcriptional regulation of the beta-casein gene by cytokines in T cells .
We have found that the beta-casein gene is expressed in a cytotoxic T cell line , CTLL-2 , in response to interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , which activates STAT5 .
While IL-4 does not activate STAT5 , it induces expression of STAT5-regulated genes in CTLL-2 , i.e. beta-casein , a cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein ( CIS ) , and oncostatin M ( OSM ) , suggesting that STAT6 activated by IL-4 substitutes for the function of STAT5 in T cells .
IL-2-induced beta-casein expression was enhanced by dexamethasone , and this synergistic effect of Dexamethasone requires the sequence between -155 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter .
Coincidentally , a deletion of this region enhanced the IL-2-induced expression of beta-casein .
Expression of an active form of Ras , Ras(G12V) , suppressed the IL-2-induced beta-casein and OSM gene expression , and the negative effect of Ras is mediated by the region between -105 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter .
In apparent contradiction , expression of a dominant negative form of Ras , RasN17 , also inhibited IL-2-induced activation of the promoter containing the minimal beta-casein STAT5 element as well as the promoters of CIS and OSM .
In addition , Ras(G12V) complemented signaling by an erythropoietin receptor mutant defective in Ras activation and augmented the activation of the beta-casein promoter by the mutant erythropoietin receptor signaling , suggesting a possible role of Ras in Stat5-mediated gene expression .
These results collectively reveal a complex interaction of STAT5 with other signaling pathways and illustrate that regulation of gene expression requires integration of opposing signals .
Hox11 is a homeobox gene essential for spleen formation in mice , since atrophy of the anlage of a developing spleen occurs in early embryonic development in Hox11 null mice .
HOX11 is also expressed in a subset of T-cell acute leukemias after specific chromosomal translocations .
Since the protein has a homeodomain and can activate transcription , it probably exerts at least some of its effects in vivo by regulation of target genes .
Representational difference analysis has been used to isolate cDNA clones corresponding to mRNA species activated following stable expression of HOX11 in NIH 3T3 cells .
The gene encoding the retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( Aldh1 ) , initially called Hdg-1 , was found to be ectopically activated by HOX11 in this system .
Study of Aldh1 gene expression during spleen development showed that the presence of Aldh1 mRNA inversely correlated with Hox11 .
Hox11 null mouse embryos have elevated Aldh1 mRNA in spleen primordia prior to atrophy , while Aldh1 seems to be repressed by Hox11 during organogenesis of the spleens of wild-type mice .
This result suggests that expression of Aldh1 protein is negatively regulated by Hox11 and that abnormal expression of Aldh1 in Hox11 null mice may cause loss of splenic precursor cells by aberrant retinoic acid metabolism .
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) signaling involves activation of STATs , proteins that serve the dual function of signal transduction and activation of transcription .
We previously demonstrated that G-CSF activated a distinct Stat3-like protein in immature and mature normal myeloid cells , StatG .
StatG in normal immature human myeloid cells , i.e. adult CD34+ bone marrow cells , was composed of Stat3beta .
This investigation was undertaken to determine the composition of StatG in mature normal human myeloid cells , i.e. polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes ( PMN ) .
These studies revealed that the major protein in extracts of PMN activated by G-CSF to bind the high-affinity serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) is a 72-kDa protein that cross-reacts with Stat3 monoclonal antibody , which we have designated Stat3gamma .
Stat3gamma is derived from Stat3alpha by limited proteolysis and lacks the carboxyl-terminal portion of Stat3alpha .
Because this region of Stat3alpha is involved in transcriptional activation , our findings suggest the possibility that Stat3gamma may be transcriptionally inactive and may compete with Stat3alpha for Stat3 binding sites in these terminally differentiated myeloid cells .
Extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f ( TWHf ) has immunosuppressive activity and has been used as anti-inflammatory agent in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries .
Recent studies have demonstrated that triptolide is the major active component in the extract that inhibits antigen or mitogen-induced T cell proliferation .
In attempting to investigate its effect on activation of T lymphocytes , we found triptolide induces apoptotic death of T cell hybridomas and peripheral T cells but not that of thymocytes .
The triptolide-induced apoptosis is accompanied by increase of DEVD-cleavable caspases activity and degradation of caspase substrate poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) .
A specific inhibitor of caspases , zVAD-FMK , prevents triptolide-induced PARP degradation and DNA fragmentation but not growth arrest .
Furthermore , enforced expression of Bcl-2 inhibited triptolide-induced degradation of PARP and apoptosis .
These results indicate that triptolide induces T cell apoptosis through activating caspases , and suggest the growth arrest and apoptotic effect of triptolide may contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of TWHf extract .
LOX-1 is an endothelial receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein that plays essential roles in atherogenesis .
LOX-1 has the highest homology with C-type lectin receptors expressed on natural killer cells .
In the present study , we cloned and characterized the human LOX-1 gene ( HGMW-approved symbol OLR1 ) .
The gene structure of LOX-1 resembles that of the natural killer cell receptors .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization and analyses of a yeast artificial chromosome contig revealed that the human LOX-1 gene is located in the natural killer gene complex on chromosome 12p12-p13 , where the genes of the natural killer cell receptors cluster .
In contrast , the expression pattern of LOX-1 is different from that of the natural killer cell receptors ; LOX-1 is expressed in vascular-rich organs , but not in lymphocytes .
A 1753-bp fragment of the 5' flanking region of the LOX-1 gene had a functional promoter activity .
This region contains binding sites for several transcription factors , including the STAT family and NF-IL6 , and the expression of LOX-1 was upregulated by several cytokines .
These results demonstrate that the human LOX-1 gene is a new member of the natural killer gene complex with a unique expression profile .

A procedure suitable for cloning labile mRNAs that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU-DD ) .
These motifs are regulatory sequences within the so-called AU-rich elements ( AREs ) often found in 3' untranslated regions of genes such as cytokines , proto-oncogenes , and transcription factors .
AU-DD is an AU-motif-directed differential display that permits the identification of ARE-containing genes differentially expressed after cell activation .
It has been applied to peripheral blood monocytes and a T cell clone to isolate 59 cDNA fragments associated to activation .
Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are cytokines and transduction/transcription factors .
The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown genes of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed .
These data demonstrate the efficiency of the system and support the notion that numerous genes falling into those categories remain unidentified and that they can be cloned by this method .

Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) , the primary physiological regulator of platelet production , was initially thought to be a lineage-specific factor acting predominantly on megakaryocytopoiesis .
Detailed studies establish that this cytokine mediates biological effects on a broad spectrum of hematopoietic progenitor cells , including stem cells .
TPO is a hormone constitutively produced mainly by the liver and kidney .
Plasma TPO levels are regulated by the platelet and megakaryocyte mass through Mpl receptor binding , internalization and degradation .
The Mpl receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily lacking intrinsic kinase activity .
Upon ligand-induced Mpl homodimerization , the major signaling events for proliferation are mediated through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway , while differentiation might occur through a prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway .
Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the potential use of TPO in a variety of contexts , but it is too early to evaluate its benefit in reducing platelet transfusion .
CD40 activation of B cells is strongly influenced by the presence of cytokines .
However , the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is not clearly delineated .
IFN regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) is a transcription factor activated by either CD40 or cytokines .
We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene , the IRF-1 gamma-activated site ( GAS ) .
Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is not confined to activation via CD40 but extends to other stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade , like TNF-alpha and EBV .
In contrast to induction of STATs by cytokines , the IRF-1 GAS-binding complex activated by CD40 , TNF-alpha , or EBV contains Rel proteins , specifically p50 and p65 .
In this system , simultaneous exposure to CD40L together with either IL-4 or IFN-gamma does not lead to the activation of novel Rel/STAT complexes .
Given the importance of IRF-1 in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis , our findings support the notion that modulation of IRF-1 levels may be a critical control point in B cell activation .
Activation of T lymphocytes by Ags or cytokines results in translocation of the transcription factors NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT from the cytoplasm into the nucleus .
The first step in the nuclear import process is recognition of a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) within the karyophilic protein by a cytoplasmic receptor such as the importin ( karyopherin ) -alpha subunit .
The NLSs of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , and NFAT differ and the NLS of STAT1 has not yet been identified .
Herein we demonstrate that the inducible nuclear import of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT1 in Jurkat T lymphocytes is significantly inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide carrying the NLS of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit .
NLS peptide-mediated disruption of the nuclear import of these transcription factors results in inhibition of I kappa B alpha and IL-2 gene expression , processes dependent on NF-kappa B or the combination of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , and NFAT .
Further , we show that inhibitory NLS peptide interacts in vitro with a cytoplasmic NLS receptor complex comprised of the Rch1/importin ( karyopherin ) -beta heterodimer expressed in Jurkat T cells .
Taken together , these data indicate that the inducible nuclear import of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT1 in Jurkat T cells can be regulated by NLS peptide delivered noninvasively to the cytoplasm of Jurkat T cells to target members of the importin ( karyopherin ) -alpha beta NLS receptor complex .
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Entamoeba histolytica infection of the intestine can induce severe gut inflammation .
The aims of this study were to assess the role of the host inflammatory response in the tissue damage observed with amebiasis and the role of the intestinal epithelial cell in initiating that response .
METHODS : E. histolytica infection was established in human intestinal xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID-HU-INT ) mice .
Human intestinal epithelial cell inflammatory responses to amebic infection were inhibited by the intraluminal administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the human p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB , and the role of neutrophils in tissue damage observed with amebiasis was studied by depleting neutrophils from SCID-HU-INT mice .
RESULTS : Administration of the antisense oligonucleotide blocked the production of human interleukin 1beta and interleukin 8 by intestinal epithelial cells and inhibited neutrophil influx into the E. histolytica-infected intestinal xenografts .
Inhibition of the gut inflammatory response by the antisense oligonucleotide or the depletion of neutrophils from SCID-HU- INT mice blocked the increase in intestinal permeability observed with amebic infection .
CONCLUSIONS : Intestinal epithelial cells initiate an inflammatory response with resulting neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in response to E. histolytica infection ; this inflammatory cascade can be blocked by inhibiting the transcription of genes regulated by nuclear factor kappaB .
We have previously shown that neu oncogene-initiated rat mammary carcinomas uniquely over-express neu-related lipocalin ( NRL ) , a member of the calycin protein superfamily .
Here , we characterize the putative human homolog of NRL , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) .
ngal gene expression was found at moderate levels in only 2 of 17 human tissues examined , breast and lung .
When breast cancers were examined for NGAL mRNA and protein levels , they were found to exhibit heterogeneous expression .
NGAL levels varied in these tumors from undetectable to exceeding those in normal breast parenchyma .
Immuno-histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of NGAL within breast carcinoma cells but detected only low levels of this protein in normal ductal epithelium .
In contrast , large amounts of the protein were localized to the lumen of normal breast ducts in the vicinity of NGAL-expressing tumors .
Interestingly , unlike NRL in rat mammary carcinomas , no significant association between NGAL expression and HER-2/neu activation was found in human breast tumors .
In contrast , a significant correlation between NGAL expression in breast cancer was found with several other markers of poor prognosis , including estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative status and high proliferation ( S-phase fraction ) .
NGAL levels were stratified as high or low in breast cancers from a cohort of node-positive patients with known outcome .
No significant association between NGAL expression and disease-free or overall survival was observed .
Post HIV-1 entry , productive HIV-1 infection of primary T cells requires overcoming several cellular blocks to provirus establishment and replication .
Activation of unknown host intracellular events overcomes such inhibitory steps and is concomitant with HIV-1 replication .
We show that the transcription factor NFATc was sufficient as a cellular factor to induce a highly permissive state for HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells .
NFATc overcame a blockade at reverse transcription and permitted active HIV-1 replication .
Pharmacologic blockade of endogenous NFAT activity by FK506 or CsA inhibited synthesis of reverse transcription and also potently blocked HIV-1 replication .
T cells therefore can become competent for HIV-1 replication by control of regulated host factors such as the NFATc transcription factor .
The host mechanisms regulated by such permissivity factors are potential targets for anti-HIV-1 therapy .
The differentiation of naive T-helper ( Th ) cells into cytokine-secreting effector Th cells requires exposure to multiple signals , including exogenous cytokines .
Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells .
In Th2 cells , IL-4 gene expression is tightly controlled at the level of transcription by the coordinated binding of multiple transcription factors to regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region .
Nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) family members play a critical role in regulating IL-4 transcription and interact with up to five sequences ( termed P0 through P4 ) in the IL-4 promoter .
The molecular mechanisms by which IL-4 induces expression of the IL-4 gene are not known , although the IL-4-activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( Stat6 ) is required for this effect .
We report here that Stat6 interacts with three binding sites in the human IL-4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
These sites overlap the P1 , P2 , and P4 NFAT elements .
To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating IL-4 transcription , we used Stat6-deficient Jurkat T cells with different intact IL-4 promoter constructs in cotransfection assays .
We show that , whereas a multimerized response element from the germline IgE promoter was highly induced by IL-4 in Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells , the intact human IL-4 promoter was repressed under similar conditions .
We conclude that the function of Stat6 is highly dependent on promoter context and that this factor promotes IL-4 gene expression in an indirect manner .
Syk-family tyrosine kinases are essential for lymphocyte development and activation .
Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Syk kinases-interacting proteins ( SKIPs ) , we isolated 3BP2 , an Abl SH3-interacting protein of unknown function .
3BP2 was selectively expressed in hematopoietic/lymphoid tissues and bound via its SH2 domain activated Syk-family kinases in mammalian cells , including in antigen receptor-stimulated T cells .
In addition to Zap-70 , the 3BP2 SH2 domain associated in vitro with LAT , Grb2 , PLCgamma1 , and Cbl from activated T cell lysates .
Transient 3BP2 overexpression induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and its NFAT or AP-1 elements .
This activity was dependent on the SH2 and pleckstrin-homology domains of 3BP2 , and required functional Syk kinases , Ras , and calcineurin .
Thus , 3BP2 is an important adaptor that may couple activated Zap-70/Syk to a LAT-containing signaling complex involved in TCR-mediated gene transcription .
Recently , the transcription factor GATA-3 was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and to augment Th2-specific cytokines .
Here , we show that loss of GATA-3 expression by developing Th1 cells requires IL-12 signaling through Stat4 and does not simply result from an absence of IL-4 .
Moreover , we demonstrate a novel role for GATA-3 in directly repressing Th1 development distinct from its positive actions on Th2-specific cytokines .
GATA-3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL-4 and that may involve repression of IL-12 signaling .
Thus , GATA-3 expression and IL-12 signaling are mutually antagonistic , which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development , producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) are inhibitory for B and T cells , IgE production , and mast cell proliferation , and they induce apoptosis in eosinophils .
These cytokines are therefore candidate genes which could contribute to the development of asthma or allergies .
We investigated the hypothesis that polymorphic nucleotides within the IL-10 and TGF-beta gene promoters would link to the expression of allergies and asthma .
DNA taken from families with an asthmatic proband was examined for base exchanges by single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) .
We demonstrated the presence of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene and four in the TGF-beta gene promoters ( 3 in TGF-beta1 and 1 in TGF-beta2 ) .
The IL-10 gene polymorphism was a C-to-A exchange 571 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and was present between consensus binding sequences for Sp1 and elevated total serum .
This polymorphism was associated with elevated total serum IgE in subjects heterozygotic or homozygotic for this base exchange ( p < 0.009 ) .
The base exchange at -509 ( from the transcription initiation site ) in the TGF-beta promoter also linked to elevated total IgE ( p < 0.01 ) .
This polymorphism represented a C-to-T base exchange which induced a YY1 consensus sequence and is present in a region of the promoter associated with negative transcription regulation .
The bipartite human interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) receptor was functionally expressed in murine pro-B cells and activated by human IL-4 to evoke intracellular signaling .
Mutual association of signal transducing proteins within the receptor complex was then studied in dependence of ligand stimulation .
Besides ligand-induced receptor heterodimerization and contacts of the two IL-4 receptor subunits alpha and gamma with Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 a prominent constitutive binding between JAK1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 was detected .
Since both these proteins become phosphorylated in response to IL-4 receptor stimulation , the influence of tyrosine phosphorylation on their mutual contact was analyzed .
Association of JAK1 and STAT5 was found to occur exclusively between unphosphorylated proteins .
Thymic dendritic cells ( DC ) mediate negative selection at a relatively late stage of the T-cell developmental pathway .
We present evidence that the development of thymic DC and of T-lineage cells is linked via a common precursor at an early stage of thymocyte development .
T-lineage precursor populations from the adult mouse thymus , prior to T-cell receptor gene rearrangement , display a capacity to produce DC as well as T cells in the thymus , and are very efficient precursors of DC in culture .
These lymphoid/DC precursors have little capacity to form myeloid cells , indicating that thymic DC are a lymphoid-related rather than myeloid-related lineage .
In contrast to myeloid-related DC , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is not required for the development of these lymphoid-related DC in vivo or in vitro .
DC can develop in mutant mice lacking mature T cells , provided the common precursors are present .
However , in mutant mice lacking functional Ikaros transcription factors , there are deficiencies in lymphoid precursor cells , in mature lymphoid cells and in DC .
Uncontrolled replication of a virus , which is harmful to the host is also disadvantageous to the virus .
Most viruses can not compete with the various immune mechanisms and become eliminated in the course of infection .
Therefore , only the time between infection and eradication remains for these viruses to proliferate .
A few viruses , like the Herpesviruses or the papillomaviruses , however , have developed a sophisticated strategy for persisting lifelong , usually asymptomatically in the host , hiding from the immune system and producing infectious progeny at the same time .
This strategy depends on a separation of latency and the lytic replication , either by time due to differentiation-dependent mechanisms or by spatial separation as the result of different host cell types .
Both are true for the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
B cells and epithelial cells have a pivotal role in the life cycle of the virus .
The former can become latently infected and are thought to be the virus reservoir in vivo , whereas the latter were shown to be permissive for lytic replication .
However , replication of EBV in vivo is controlled primarily by host immune mechanisms selecting for cells that are not permissive for viral replication as the result of a particular set of transcription factors .
These factors control the activity of the regulatory immediate-early genes and , in addition , lytic and latent cycle regulatory genes negatively interfere with each other and thus link cellular and viral gene regulatory mechanisms .
Disturbance of both the immune surveillance as well as viral gene regulation may result in EBV-associated disease .
A human dendritic cell-based assay used to monitor a T cell proliferation response to viral peptides in vitro is described .
Dendritic cells and autologous CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood by a series of density-gradient centrifugations or magnetic bead separations ( or both ) .
Peptides corresponding to residues of the immediate early protein , IE62 , of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) were used as stimulating antigens , and persons with no history of varicella and no humoral or cellular immunity to VZV served as naive donors for the assays .
Three VZV-susceptible donors were tested , and all demonstrated an in vitro response to multiple VZV peptides .
This assay has potential as a screen to establish the immunogenicity of viral antigens in vitro using T cells from naive donors .
Glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and 3-O-methyl-D glucose ( 3-O-MG ) transport were determined in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) from 11 abdominal obese subjects , 10 pituitary-dependent Cushing 's syndrome ( Cushing 's disease ) and 10 healthy controls .
Using a whole-cell competitive binding assay and 3H-dexamethasone as tracer , MNL of abdominal obese subjects were found to have 4855 +/- 1389 sites/cell which was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than controls ( 6234 +/- 1568 sites/cell ) , although no significant difference was found in the mean serum cortisol level .
Their mean Kd ( affinity ) was also significantly lower than that found in the healthy controls ( obese Kd : 2.92 +/- 0.84 nmol/l , control Kd : 4.55 +/- 0.67 nM , p < 0.05 ) .
On the other hand , the receptor characteristics in Cushing 's disease patients were within the normal range .
At the same time , 3-O-MG transport was determined in the same subjects .
In Cushing 's disease , 3-O-MG transport was within the normal range , whereas in abdominal obesity this value was significantly lower than the healthy controls ( abdominal obese : 31.90 +/- 8.20 ; control : 46.26 +/- 12.91 fmol/10(6) cell , min , p < 0.05 ) .
We also found a positive correlation between 3-O-MG transport and GR binding capacity in abdominal subjects ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.001 ) , however we did not find such a correlation in Cushing 's disease ( r = 0.60 , p > 0.05 ) .
These results indicated that , in abdominal obesity , the GR binding capacity in MNL is influenced by the changes in glucose transport .
Restoration of the CCAAT box or insertion of an erythroid Kruppel-like factor ( EKLF ) binding site in the delta promoter activates its expression in several erythroid cell lines .
We extended these studies using a novel primary human adult erythroid cell ( hAEC ) system to investigate these effects at the late erythroblast stage .
Restoration of the CCAAT box at -70 bp , or insertion of an EKLF binding site at -85 bp or -95 bp in the promoter significantly increased delta globin gene expression in hAEC .
Our results demonstrate that the altered CCAAT box ( CCAAC ) and the lack of an EKLF binding site in delta-globin contribute to its low level of expression in the hAEC model as well .
AIDS-related Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated T cell lymphomas are emerging as a new , distinct histopathological entity .
The pathway whereby EBV infects T cells as well as the initial EBV transcriptional program in T cells has not been established .
In order to shed light on the early events of the EBV infection of T cells , we have used in situ reverse transcription based polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) to study the initial EBV transcriptional program in homogeneous CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes .
Following EBV infection , Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) expression could be detected in T rosetting CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes .
Only a few cells showed viral capsid antigen ( VCA ) .
EBV immediate-early gene transcripts ( BZLF1 , BRLF1 , and BMLF1 ) encoded in the BamHI Z , R , and M fragments could be detected by in situ RT-PCR in the EBV producer cell line B95.8 .
Both BZLF1 and BRLF1 immediate-early transcripts , but not BMLF1 transcript , could be detected in individual CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infected with EBV .
Demonstration of EBV mRNA transcripts encoding immediate-early transcriptional transactivators in EBV-infected T cells provides the first evidence for a possible mechanism whereby EBV could contribute to T cell proliferation and EBV-associated T cell malignancies .
Ciprofibrate , an hypolipidaemic peroxisome proliferator , induced differentiation of HL-60 cells .
The effect was greatly potentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a concentration where neither phorbol ester nor ciprofibrate alone had any effect on these cells .
As occurs for HL-60 cell differentiation induced by high phorbol ester concentration , the ciprofibrate-induced phorbol ester-dependent differentiation of HL-60 cells proceeded through the monocytic/macrophage pathway and induced the phosphorylation of proteins with similar molecular weights suggesting that increased protein kinase C activity may be involved in the effect .
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARalpha ) transcription factor is expressed in HL-60 cells , but no changes were observed in its expression upon HL-60 cell differentiation .
The induction of IgE switching in B cells requires several signals given by cytokines and cell contact-delivered signals .
Here , we investigated the role of CD27/CD70 interaction in B cell IgE synthesis .
The addition of CD27 ligand ( CD70 ) transfectants to B cell cultures increased the IgE synthesis synergistically in the presence of IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb ( anti-CD40 ) .
The effect of CD70 transfectants was dose dependent and was completely blocked by anti-CD70 mAb .
CD27+ B cells had the ability to produce IgE , which was increased by contact with CD70 transfectants , whereas CD27- B cells did not produce IgE .
CD27/CD70 interaction enhanced B cell proliferation in the presence of IL-4 or IL-4 plus anti-CD40 .
The augmentation of B cell proliferation by CD70 transfectants was apparent in CD27+ B cells , but was mild in CD27- B cells .
The helper activity for IgE synthesis by the CD27/CD70 interaction did not contribute to the enhancement of germline epsilon transcripts .
Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to B cell cultures remarkably promoted differentiation into plasma cells in the presence of IL-4 and CD40 signaling .
Finally , CD27 cross-linking resulted in the up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1 .
Taken together , our findings indicate that signaling via CD27 on B cells induces IgE synthesis , in cooperation with IL-4 and CD40 signaling , by promoting the generation of plasma cells through up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1 .
Type I IFNs ( IFN-alpha/beta ) , in addition to IL-12 , have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human , but not mouse , Th cells .
We show here that IFN-alpha/beta act directly on human T cells to drive Th1 development , bypassing the need for IL-12-induced signaling , whereas IFN-alpha can not substitute IL-12 for mouse Th1 development .
The molecular basis for this species specificity is that IFN-alpha/beta activate Stat4 in differentiating human , but not mouse , Th cells .
Unlike IL-12 , which acts only on Th1 cells , IFN-alpha/beta can activate Stat4 not only in human Th1 , but also in Th2 cells .
However , restimulation of human Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-alpha does not induce the production of IFN-gamma .
These results suggest that activation of Stat4 , which is necessary for the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 cells , is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of human Th2 cells .
Phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , which is described as an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity , inhibits H2O2 release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) as measured by electrochemistry .
Since human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is known to be favored under oxidative stress conditions , ex vivo experiments using uninfected PBMCs , primary monocytes or a latently infected promonocytic U1 cell line show that HIV-1 replication and reactivation , monitored by p24 antigen measurement , are inhibited by PAO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner .
These observations can be linked with the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation when uninfected monocytes are induced by either tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Environmental estrogens or estrogen disrupters have recently received a great deal of attention because of their potential health impact on reproductive tissues .
Few , if any , studies have been made on the impact of these compounds on the immune system .
We sought to determine the activities of various environmental estrogens on the modulation of the interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene in a model monocytic cell line , hER + IL-1beta-CAT+ .
This cell line stably transfected with the human estrogen receptor , and an IL-1beta promoter construct fused to the CAT reporter gene allows us to monitor the effect of estrogenic compounds on IL-1beta promoter activity .
17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) markedly enhanced lipopolysaccharide- ( LPS ) induced IL-1beta promoter-driven CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner .
The mycotoxins alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone both exhibited full agonist activity , but at lower potencies , with EC50 values of 1.8 and 54 nM , respectively , compared with E2 at 0.5 nM .
In addition , genistein was a very low-potency agonist , having an EC50 of 1.5 microM .
Similar to the E2 response , the slope factors for alpha-zearalenol , zearalenone , and genistein were close to 3.0 , suggesting positive cooperativity in the estrogenic response .
The activity of the mycotoxins appeared to be mediated through the estrogen receptor , since both the antiestrogens H1285 and ICI 182 , 780 effectively inhibited their agonist activity in a dose-dependent manner .
Representative environmental estrogenic compounds both from plant and industrial sources were also tested .
Unlike the mycoestrogens , none of the compounds , with the exception of genistein , synergized with LPS to enhance IL-1beta promoter activity .
When tested for antiestrogenic activity , the industrial compound 4-octylphenol was able to antagonize the response to E2 ; however , the response was three orders of magnitude less potent than H 1285 .
Naringenin , a plant flavonoid , showed little or no ability to antagonize the response to E2 .
Overall , the results show that some environmental estrogens that display agonist activity in reproductive tissue also have an effect on IL-1 gene expression in hemopoietic-derived tissue .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) protects animals from lethal endotoxemia .
This beneficial effect is mediated , in part , by inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production , including tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Evidence suggests that IL-10 may inhibit activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) through an unknown mechanism .
NF-kappaB activation in response to inflammatory signals is dependent upon degradation of its associated inhibitory peptide , inhibitory kappaB-alpha ( IkappaB-alpha ) .
We hypothesized that IL-10 prevents human monocyte NF-kappaB activation and resultant TNF-alpha production by stabilization of IkappaB-alpha .
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of IL-10 on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced human monocyte TNF-alpha production , NF-kappaB activation , and IkappaB-alpha degradation .
Monocytes were isolated from human donors .
Cells were stimulated with endotoxin ( LPS , 100 ng/mL ) with and without human IL-10 ( 10 ng/mL ) .
Following stimulation , TNF-alpha was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA , NF-kappaB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , and IkappaB-alpha levels by Western blot .
We observed that after LPS stimulation of human monocytes , TNF-alpha increased to 798+/-67 pg/mL ( p < .001 versus control ) .
IL-10 attenuated LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha production ( 297+/-54 ; p < .001 versus LPS alone ) .
After LPS stimulation in human monocytes , IkappaB-alpha protein levels decreased , and NF-kappaB DNA binding increased .
IL-10 pretreatment prevented LPS-induced decreases in IkappaB-alpha protein levels and attenuated NF-kappaB DNA binding .
IL-10 appears to prevent activation of NF-kappaB by preserving IkappaB-alpha protein levels , leading to a reduction in TNF-alpha release .
T cell receptor engagement activates transcription factors important for cytokine gene regulation .
Additionally , this signaling pathway also leads to activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes that is dependent on FasL transcription and expression .
Here we demonstrate that nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes expressed in activated lymphocytes , also plays a role in T cell activation-induced FasL expression .
Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in a T cell hybridoma leads to decreased FasL expression and apoptosis upon T cell receptor stimulation .
We identified the NF-kappaB site in the FasL promoter that contributes to such regulation .
Co-expression of p65 ( Rel A ) with the FasL promoter enhanced its activity , and co-expression of IkappaB dramatically inhibited the inducible promoter activity .
In contrast , the transcription factor AP-1 is not required for activation-induced FasL promoter activity .
These results define a role for NF-kappaB in mediating FasL expression during T cell activation .
Various cellular stress agents like ionizing radiation exposure could activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV- 1 ) replication or reporter gene expression .
In addition , extracellular factor ( s ) released by X-ray-treated human colonic carcinoma cell line ( HT29 ) might activate the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 in non-irradiated HT29 cells .
In the present report we show that in various transiently or stably transfected cell lines , X-ray irradiation up-regulates HIV-1 LTR transcription through the kappaB regulatory elements .
A factor ( s ) , which is processed by and acts upon a variety of cell types , was detected by addition to non-irradiated cells of either X-ray-treated cells or a conditioned medium taken from irradiated cultures .
The magnitude of responsiveness is cell type dependent .
In addition , X-ray activation of HIV-1 LTR in transiently or stably transfected cell lines is inhibited by a potent antioxidant drug , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and by another drug , known for its role in the trapping of growth factors , suramin .
The importance of these observations in the pathophysiology of patients with AIDS-related cancers treated by radiotherapy remains to be established .
Many studies show that monoamine oxidase B in blood cells is a biological marker for personality characteristics such as sensation seeking .
The mechanism underlying this association is so far not explored .
In the present study we have performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to investigate the pattern of protein binding to a 150 bp fragment of the proximal 5'-flanking region of the human monoamine oxidase B gene .
We compared the pattern using nuclear extracts from human brain and lymphocytes .
Interestingly , a correlation was observed between monoamine oxidase B enzyme activity in blood cells ( platelets ) and the binding pattern of two uncharacterized transcription factors .
These data are well in line with the long-standing notion that interindividual differences in platelet monoamine oxidase may represent differences in expression of the enzyme rather than genotypic variation .
Since one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated at an early stage of female embryonic development , X-linked markers have been used to study the origin and development of various neoplastic disorders in affected heterozygous women ; clonality assays have provided a useful tool to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of neoplasia .
Recently , a technique of clonal analysis has been devised that takes advantage of a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat within the X-linked human androgen receptor ( AR ) gene , resulting in a heterozygosity rate approaching 90 % .
The rapid expansion of the number of women now suitable for X inactivation analysis has however given rise to new controversies , one of the more troublesome being the possibility of a modification of the pattern of X- chromosome inactivation pattern in blood cells of elderly women .
In the present study we analyze with the AR assay a group of 166 healthy females aged between 8 and 94 years , with no history of genetic or neoplastic familial disorders .
We failed to find any correlation between age and X- chromosome inactivation pattern ( r = 0.17 ) , even subdividing the subjects in different age groups according to the criteria used by other researchers , and therefore reaffirm that , when tested for with well-standardized and accurate criteria , extremely unbalanced inactivation of the X chromosome is a truly uncommon phenomenon in normal women .

To characterize the human elk-1 promoter , we mapped the transcriptional start site and isolated elk-1-specific genomic phage clones that contained extensive upstream and downstream sequences .
A TATA-like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site .
Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site ( HS 1 ) in close proximity to the TATA box suggest that the identified TATA motif is important for elk-1 transcription in vivo .
Sequences upstream and downstream from the TATA box were found to contribute to elk-1 promoter activity .
A second hypersensitive site ( HS 2 ) was identified within the first intron in pre-monocytic cells , which express Elk-1 only when differentiating to monocytes .
In a variety of other cell types , which display a constitutive Elk-1 expression , HS 2 did not exist , suggesting that inducibility of elk-1 expression is associated with the presence of HS 2 .
Egr-1 and the serum response factor were found to interact specifically with the intronic sequence at +265 and +448 , respectively .
Because Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed to increase significantly before induction of elk-1 expression , we propose that Egr-1 is important for the regulation of elk-1 transcription in differentiating monocytes .
Proteins involved in repression of the human beta-globin gene may be useful in the treatment of sickle cell anemia , in conjunction with therapy to reactivate fetal globin genes .
If there is a reciprocal elevation of gamma-globin expression upon repression , this approach could be useful in additional hemoglobinopathies .
We previously showed that repression of the beta-globin gene appears to be mediated through two DNA sequences , silencers I and II , and identified a protein termed BP1 which binds to both silencer sequences .
In this study , we cloned two cDNAs encoding proteins which bind to an oligonucleotide in silencer I containing a BP1 binding site .
These cDNAs correspond to HMG-I and HMG-Y , isoforms regarded as architectural proteins .
We demonstrate that binding of HMG-I(Y) to this oligonucleotide causes bending/flexure of the DNA .
HMG-I(Y) also binds to a second oligonucleotide containing a BP1 binding site located in a negative control region upstream of the delta-globin gene , suggesting a role for HMG-I(Y) in repression of adult globin genes .
Expression studies revealed that HMG-I(Y) is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues that do not express beta-globin , being present in 48 of 50 tissues and six hematopoietic cell lines examined .
Furthermore , HMG-I(Y) expression is down-regulated during differentiation of primary erythroid cells .
We present a model in which HMG-I(Y) alters DNA conformation to allow binding of repressor proteins , and in which the relative amount of HMG-I(Y) helps to determine the repressive state of the beta-globin gene .
The physiological role of the pro-myelocytic leukaemia ( PML ) gene product is poorly defined .
Among other functions , PML is involved in haematopoietic differentiation and in control of cell growth and tumorigenesis .
We investigated the regulation of human PML expression by interferons ( IFNs ) and IL-1 in various human haematopoietic lines ( U937 , THP1 , HL60 , NB4 ) , in human diploid fibroblasts and in human peripheral blood leukocytes .
Cytokine-induced modulation of PML expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses , flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling .
Our data show that IFNs and IL-1 upregulate PML transcript and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner .
In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by IFN-alpha is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so-called PML nuclear bodies .
Our data suggest that stimulation of PML expression by interferons and IL-1 may account for upregulation of PML proteins observed in inflammatory tissues and in proliferative states .
Dendritic cells ( DC ) are potent APC during primary and secondary immune responses .
The first objective of this study was to determine whether human DC mediate in vitro sensitization of naive CD4+ T cells to epitopes of the immediate early 62 ( IE62 ) protein of varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) .
The induction of CD4+ T cell proliferative responses to eight synthetic peptides representing amino acid sequences of the VZV IE62 protein was assessed using T cells and DC from VZV-susceptible donors .
The second objective was to compare in vitro responses of naive T cells with responses to VZV peptides induced in vivo after immunization with varicella vaccine .
T cell proliferation was induced by three peptides , P1 , P4 , and P7 , in 71-100 % of the donors tested before and after vaccination using DC as APC .
Monocytes were effective APC for VZV peptides only after immunization .
Two peptides , P2 and P8 , induced naive T cell proliferation less effectively and were also less immunogenic for T cells from vaccinated or naturally immune donors .
T cell recognition of specific peptides was concordant between naive , DC-mediated responses , and postvaccine responses using monocytes as APC in 69 % of comparisons ( p = 0.05 ; chi2 ) ; the predictive value of a positive response to an IE62 peptide before immunization for T cell sensitization in vivo was 82 % .
These observations indicate that primary T cell responses detected in vitro using DC as APC may be useful to characterize the potential immunogenicity of viral protein epitopes in vivo .
We compared U-937 cell adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical venous ( HUVECs ) and arterial ( HUAECs ) endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin-1 , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
TNF and LPS stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 surface expression and adhesion of U-937 monocyte-like cells to HUVECs but not to HUAECs .
Antibody studies demonstrated that in HUVECs at least 75 % of the adhesion response is VCAM-1 mediated .
Interleukin-1 stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to and VCAM-1 surface expression in both HUVECs and HUAECs .
Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked TNF- and LPS-stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to HUVECs .
These agents also significantly decreased TNF- and LPS-stimulated increases in HUVEC surface VCAM-1 .
TNF increased VCAM-1 protein and mRNA in HUVECs that was blocked by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate .
However , neither TNF or LPS stimulated VCAM-1 expression in HUAECs .
TNF stimulated expression of both intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs , but in HUAECs , only intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was increased .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated no difference in the pattern of TNF-stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB activation between HUVECs and HUAECs .
These studies demonstrate a novel and striking insensitivity of arterial endothelium to the effects of TNF and LPS and indicate a dissociation between the ability of HUAECs to upregulate nuclear factor-kappaB and VCAM-1 .
Interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) is a chemokine that belongs to the alpha-chemokine or CXC subfamily and is produced by a wide variety of human cells , including monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells ( PMN ) .
IL-8 is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli , notably bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , but little is known about the mechanisms by which these agents mediate IL-8 induction .
In this report , we show that Mycoplasma fermentans lipid-associated membrane proteins ( LAMPf ) induce the production of high levels of IL-8 by THP-1 ( human monocyte ) cells and PMN at the same extent as LPS .
It was previously demonstrated that stimulation of monocytic cells with either LPS or LAMPf led to a series of common downstream signaling events , including the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades .
By using PD-98059 and SB203580 , two potent and selective inhibitors of MEK1 ( a kinase upstream of ERK1/2 ) and p38 , respectively , we have demonstrated that both ERK1/2 and p38 cascades play a key role in the production of IL-8 by monocytes and PMN stimulated with bacterial fractions .
The Notch receptor protein was originally identified in Drosophila and is known to mediate cell to cell communication and influence cell fate decisions .
Members of this family have been isolated from invertebrates as well as vertebrates .
We isolated mouse Notch-1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen with Nur77 , which is a protein that has been shown previously to be required for apoptosis in T cell lines .
The data presented below indicate that Notch-1 expression provides significant protection to T cell lines from TCR-mediated apoptosis .
These data demonstrate a new antiapoptotic role for Notch-1 , providing evidence that , in addition to regulating cell fate decisions , Notch-1 can play a critical role in controlling levels of cell death in T cells .
Butyric acid ( BA ) is known to induce overexpression of fetal hemoglobin and then erythroid differentiation .
Therefore , BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer .
Nevertheless , the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown .
Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of erythroid genes occurred at the transcriptional level , suggesting the involvement of erythroid transcription factors .
Here , we intend to demonstrate the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcription factors in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells .
Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 proteins increased during BA treatment .
Moreover , antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either GATA-1 or p45 NF-E2 proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation .
In contrast , BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected .
These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in BA-induced differentiation process .
It is becoming increasingly apparent that NF-kappa B plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response .
Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the proteasome plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade by regulating the activation of NF-kappa B .
Indeed , the availability of selective and orally active proteasome inhibitors should prove useful in delineating the roles of the proteasome and NF-kappa B in other pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and heart disease .
A reduced expression of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) in parathyroid glands of uremic animals and humans has been observed .
Similar results have been obtained by our own group in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal failure .
However , the reasons for these changes are not clear .
In the present study , we have investigated the specific uptake of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 by PBMC of 11 women with advanced chronic renal failure ( A-CRF ) , 6 women with mild-moderate renal insufficiency ( M-CRF ) , and 23 healthy women .
The mean dissociation constant ( KD ) was similar in both groups of patients and in healthy women ( A-CRF : 0.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(-10) M ; M-CRF : 1.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(-10) M ; controls : 1.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(-10) M ) .
However , VDR concentration was significantly decreased in A-CRF ( 0.8 +/- 0.5 fmol/10(7) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(7) cells in controls , p < 0.001 ) , whereas no changes were seen in M-CRF ( 1.7 +/- 0.7 fmol/10(7) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(7) cells in controls ) .
No correlation was seen between VDR and serum calcitriol or PTH levels , when considering both groups of patients together or separately .
Conversely , a significant negative correlation was found between VDR and serum creatinine values when A-CRF and M-CRF were considered altogether ( r = -0.63 ; p < 0.01 ) .
Treatment with two different schedules of oral calcitriol ( five patients with 0.5 microgram/day for 1 month and four patients with 2 micrograms/day for 7 days ) did not change VDR concentrations .
We conclude that the low levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D3 of uremia are not responsible for the decrease in VDR concentration found in these patients .
When immunoglobulin ( Ig ) -secreting plasmacytomas are fused to a T-cell lymphoma , Ig gene expression ceases in greater than 95 % of the resulting hybrids .
In the rare hybrids that continue to express Ig , all other tested B lymphocyte-specific genes also remain active .
The low frequency with which these Ig-expressing hybrids are recovered , along with the fact that cell fusions can lead to chromosome loss , led us to propose that this rare phenotype was due to loss of a T-cell-derived chromosome encoding a factor or factors with gene silencing activity .
To identify the relevant chromosome , we have used a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -assisted method of chromosome mapping to analyze both Ig-silenced ( common ) and Ig-expressing ( rare ) hybrids .
Although no single chromosome was found to correlate with Ig gene silencing , we discovered that the two types of hybrids had undergone distinct patterns of chromosome loss .
Moreover , we found that ectopic expression of a B-cell-specific transcription factor ( Oct-2 ) dramatically altered both the phenotype and chromosome constitution of hybrids arising in these cell fusions .
HTLV-I is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and is associated with tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy .
Following integration into the host cell genome , HTLV-I replication is regulated by both host and viral mechanisms that control transcription .
Low levels of viral transcription ( basal transcription ) occur before expression of the virally encoded Tax protein ( Tax-mediated transcription ) .
Members of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) response element binding ( CREB ) /activating transcription factor 1 ( ATF-1 ) family of transcription factors bind three 21-bp repeats ( Tax-responsive element-1 , or TRE-1 ) within the viral promoter and are important for basal and Tax-mediated transcription .
Using mitogen stimulated and quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and Jurkat cells , we compared differences in basal transcription and amounts and binding of transcription factors with TRE-1 .
We demonstrate that amounts of transcriptionally active phosphorylated CREB protein ( P-CREB ) differ between activated PBMC and Jurkat cells .
Following stimulation , P-CREB levels remain elevated in PBMC for up to 24 hours whereas CREB is dephosphorylated in Jurkat cells within 4 hours following stimulation .
The differences in P-CREB levels between PBMC and Jurkat cells were directly correlated with basal transcription of HTLV-I in the two cell types .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we determined that the pattern of band migration differed between the two cell types .
These data demonstrate that PBMC differentially regulate basal HTLV-I transcription compared with Jurkat T cells , and this differential regulation is due , in part to differential phosphorylation and binding of CREB/ATF-1 to TRE-1 in the HTLV-I promoter .
We demonstrate the utility of using primary lymphocyte models to study HTLV-I transcription in the context of cell signaling and suggest that activated PBMC maintain elevated levels of P-CREB , which promote basal HTLV-I transcription and enhance viral persistence in vivo .
The active metabolite of vitamin D , 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 , is an important immunoregulatory hormone [ 1 ] .
Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor , which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes .
Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases : tuberculosis , malaria , and hepatitis B virus .
Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 ( genotype tt ) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis ( chi2 = 6.22 , 1 df , P = .01 ) and persistent hepatitis B infection ( chi2 = 6.25 , 1 df , P = .01 ) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes .
Therefore , this genetic variant , which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations , may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases .
We have previously demonstrated that interaction of infected thymocytes with autologous thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) is a prerequisite for a high level of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in thymocytes ( M.Rothe , L.Chene , M.Nugeyre , F.Barre-Sinoussi , and N.Israel , J.Virol.72 : 5852-5861 , 1998 ) .
We report here that this activation of HIV replication takes place at the transcriptional level through activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors .
We first demonstrate that an HIV-1 provirus ( SF-2 strain ) very effectively replicates in thymocytes cocultured with TEC whereas this provirus , with kappaB sites deleted , fails to replicate .
We provide evidence that several NF-kappaB complexes are constitutively found in the nuclei of thymocytes either freshly isolated from the thymus or maintained in coculture with autologous or heterologous TEC .
The prevalent complex is the heterodimer p50-p65 .
NF-kappaB activity is tightly correlated with the transcriptional activity of a long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 transfected in thymocytes .
The cotransfection of this LTR with a mutated IkappaBalpha molecule formally demonstrates that LTR transactivation is regulated by members of the Rel/NF-kappaB family in thymocytes .
We also showed that tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and to a lesser extent interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , secreted within the coculture , induce NF-kappaB activity and a correlative LTR transactivation .
However IL-7 , a crucial factor for thymopoiesis that is secreted mainly by TEC , is a necessary cofactor for NF-kappaB activation elicited by TNF or IL-1 .
Together , these data indicate that NF-kappaB activation , required for a high level of HIV replication in thymocytes , is regulated in a specific manner in the thymic microenvironment which provides the necessary cytokines : TNF , IL-1 , and IL-7 .
Two variants of the IL-4R alpha-chain ( IL-4Ralpha ) gene have been recently identified in association with different atopic disorders .
To clarify the etiological relationship between the two variants , we analyzed responsiveness to IL-4 of transfectants with four kinds of IL-4Ralpha carrying either Val or Ile at 50 and either Gln or Arg at 551 .
The substitution of Ile for Val augmented STAT6 activation , proliferation , and transcription activity of the Iepsilon promoter by IL-4 , whereas that of Arg for Gln did not change these IL-4 signals .
Arg551 was not associated with atopic asthma in the Japanese population .
CD23 expression and IgE synthesis by IL-4 were augmented in Ile50-bearing PBMC , compared with those bearing Val50 .
Taken together , substitution of Arg551 does not enhance the IL-4 signal for generation of germline epsilon transcript , whereas the substitution of Ile50 contributes to enhancement of IgE synthesis .
The induction of clonal anergy in a T cell inhibits IL-2 secretion because of the development of a proximal signal transduction defect .
Fusion of anergic murine T cells to human Jurkat T leukemia cells and formation of heterokaryons failed to result in a complementation of this signaling defect and restoration of murine IL-2 mRNA inducibility .
Instead , signal transduction to the human IL-2 gene became disrupted .
Heterokaryons formed by the fusion of anergic murine T cells to normal murine T cells also failed to accumulate intracellular IL-2 protein in response to stimulation either with the combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs or with ionomycin plus a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester .
The results argue against a loss-of-function signaling defect as the sole basis for clonal anergy induction and document the presence of a dominant-acting repressor molecule that inhibits signal transduction to the IL-2 gene within viable anergic T cells .
Fas ligand ( FasL ) on cytotoxic lymphocytes is important for mediating apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and other target cells .
We have reported that NK cell functions , such as proliferation , cell death , and killing activity , are subject to regulation by cellular redox status .
Here , we report that expression of FasL protein and mRNA in activated NK cells is also regulated by redox .
Ligation of CD16 on IL-2-preactivated NK cells resulted in reduction of intracellular peroxide level as well as induction of FasL expression .
This CD16-induced FasL expression was suppressed by oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or treatment with hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) .
Addition of thiol-reducing compounds , such as L-cystine , 2-ME , or N-acetyl cysteine , restored FasL expression .
These data suggest that CD16 stimulation requires cellular reducing status for FasL induction in NK cells .
Because FasL gene activation following CD16 cross-linking is regulated by the NF of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , we examined the effect of oxidative stresses on NFAT activation .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both thiol insufficiency and H2O2 treatment suppressed DNA-binding activity of NFAT and that addition of thiol-reducing compounds reversed or even enhanced it .
Furthermore , these oxidative stresses inhibited activity of calcineurin , a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates NFAT activation .
These results suggest that suppression of calcineurin and NFAT activation is a mechanism by which oxidative stress inhibits FasL induction in activated NK cells and further support the hypothesis that thiol-reducing compounds might be required for maintenance of optimal NK functions under physiologic oxidative conditions .
CD44 is a ubiquitous molecule also known as hyaluronic acid or homing receptor .
However , the cellular functions and its role in inflammation , for example , rheumatoid synovitis , are currently unknown .
In this study , we propose a novel function for CD44 .
Using synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , we demonstrated that CD44 cross-linking and binding to hyaluronan augmented VCAM-1 expression and subsequently VCAM-1-mediated cell adhesion .
Briefly , we found that 1 ) rheumatoid synovial cells highly expressed CD44 ; 2 ) cross-linking of CD44 markedly but transiently augmented VCAM-1 expression and its mRNA transcription much more than did IL-1beta and TNF-alpha ; 3 ) hyaluronan , especially when fragmented , also up-regulated VCAM-1 ; 4 ) CD44 activated the transcription factor AP-1 ; and 5 ) the integrin-dependent adhesive function of RA synovial cells to T cells was also amplified by CD44 cross-linking .
These results indicate that the adhesion of RA synovial cells to matrices such as hyaluronic acid through CD44 could up-regulate VCAM-1 expression and VCAM-1-mediated adhesion to T cells , which might in turn cause activation of T cells and synovial cells in RA synovitis .
We therefore propose that such cross-talking among distinct adhesion molecules may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation , including RA synovitis .
Interleukin 16 ( IL-16 ) is a chemotactic cytokine that binds to the CD4 receptor and affects the activation of T cells and replication of HIV .
It is expressed as a large 67-kDa precursor protein ( pro-IL-16 ) in lymphocytes , macrophages , and mast cells , as well as in airway epithelial cells from asthmatics after challenge with allergen .
This pro-IL-16 is subsequently processed to the mature cytokine of 13 kDa .
To study the expression of IL-16 at the transcriptional level , we cloned the human chromosomal IL-16 gene and analyzed its promoter .
The human IL-16 gene consists of seven exons and six introns .
The 5' sequences up to nucleotide -120 of the human and murine IL-16 genes share > 84 % sequence homology and harbor promoter elements for constitutive and inducible transcription in T cells .
Although both promoters lack any TATA box , they contain two CAAT box-like motifs and three binding sites of GA-binding protein ( GABP ) transcription factors .
Two of these motifs are part of a highly conserved and inducible dyad symmetry element shown previously to control a remote IL-2 enhancer and the CD18 promoter .
In concert with the coactivator CREB binding protein/p300 , which interacts with GABPalpha , the binding of GABPalpha and -beta to the dyad symmetry element controls the induction of IL-16 promoter in T cells .
Supplementing the data on the processing of pro-IL-16 , our results indicate the complexity of IL-16 expression , which is tightly controlled at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels in T lymphocytes .
