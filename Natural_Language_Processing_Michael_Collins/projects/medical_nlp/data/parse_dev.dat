Recent studies show that human osteoclasts develop in vitro from hematopoietic cells ; however , special cultures conditions and/or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood are apparently required .
Here , we report that cells expressing osteoclast markers differentiate from precursors present in nonmobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , without the addition of stromal cells , growth factors , cytokines or steroids ; and characterize their phenotype .
Three days after establishing high-density PBMC cultures ( 1.5 x 10(6) cells/cm2 ) , in serum-containing medium , small adherent colonies of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive ( TRAP+ ) cells emerge , amidst massive monocyte cell death .
These adherent cells have an eccentrically placed , round nucleus , and express low levels of TRAP and sodium fluoride-resistant- alpha-naphthyl-acetate-esterase ( NaF-R-NSE ) .
Over the next week , this cell population accumulates phenotypic markers of osteoclasts ( vitronectin receptor [ VR ] , calcitonin receptor , TRAP , cathepsin K protein , and mRNA ) with increased nuclearity , covering the entire surface by 15 days .
When cultured on bone , VR+ , TRAP+ cells of low multinuclearity appear and cover up to 50 % of the surface .
Resorption lacunae can be observed by day 22 .
Although these pits are not nearly as numerous as the cells of preosteoclast phenotype , they do represent the activity of a subset of osteoclast-like cells that has achieved osteoclastic maturity under these culture conditions .
Transcripts for osteoprotegerin ligand ( OPGL ) , an osteoclast differentiation factor ( also known as RANKL and TRANCE ) are expressed , likely by adherent cells .
Thus , an adherent population of cells , with preosteoclast/osteoclast phenotypic properties , arises selectively under simple culture conditions from normal PBMC .
Further characterization of these cells should identify factors involved in the growth , terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) helps maintain polarized T-helper cells in a T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) phenotype .
Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of Th1 cells , which are a primary source of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , a potent activator of monocytes and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation .
Because monocytes and macrophages are important mediators of Th1-type responses , such as delayed-type hypersensitivity , we sought to determine if IL-10 could directly mediate inhibition of IFNgamma- and IFNalpha-induced gene expression in these cells .
Highly purified monocytes were incubated with IL-10 for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition of IFNgamma or IFNalpha .
IL-10 preincubation resulted in the inhibition of gene expression for several IFN-induced genes , such as IP-10 , ISG54 , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 .
The reduction in gene expression resulted from the ability of IL-10 to suppress IFN-induced assembly of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors to specific promoter motifs on IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-inducible genes .
This was accomplished by preventing the IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , a component of both IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-induced DNA binding complexes .
Therefore , IL-10 can directly inhibit STAT-dependent early response gene expression induced by both IFNalpha and IFNgamma in monocytes by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 .
This may occur through the ability of IL-10 to induce expression of the gene , suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 ( SOCS3 ) .
The alpha2beta1 integrin , a collagen receptor on platelets and megakaryocytes , is required for normal platelet function .
Transcriptional regulation of the alpha2 integrin gene in cells undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation requires a core promoter between bp -30 and -92 , a silencer between bp -92 and -351 , and megakaryocytic enhancers in the distal 5' flank .
We have now identified a 229-bp region of the distal 5' flank of the alpha2 integrin gene required for high-level enhancer activity in cells with megakaryocytic features .
Two tandem AP1 binding sites with dyad symmetry are required for enhancer activity and for DNA-protein complex formation with members of the c-fos/c-jun family .
The requirement for AP1 activation suggested a role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway in regulating alpha2 integrin gene expression .
Inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade with PD98059 , a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1 , prevented the expression of the alpha2 integrin subunit in cells induced to become megakaryocytic .
We provide a model of megakaryocytic differentiation in which expression of the alpha2 integrin gene requires signaling via the MAP kinase pathway to activate two tandem AP1 binding sites in the alpha2 integrin enhancer .
The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome ( IHES ) is a rare disorder characterized by unexplained , persistent eosinophilia associated with multiple organ dysfunction due to eosinophilic tissue infiltration .
In the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , there is no specific test to detect clonal eosinophilia in IHES .
Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation patterns can be used to determine whether proliferative disorders are clonal in origin .
Methylation of HpaII and Hha I sites near the polymorphic trinucleotide repeat of the human androgen receptor gene ( HUMARA ) has been shown to correlate with X-inactivation .
In this study , we have used the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with nested primers to analyze X-inactivation patterns of the HUMARA loci in purified eosinophils from female patients with eosinophilia .
Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated by their autofluoresence using flow cytometric sorting .
Eosinophils purified from a female patient presenting with IHES were found to show a clonal pattern of X-inactivation .
Eosinophil-depleted leukocytes from this patient were polyclonal by HUMARA analysis , thus excluding skewedness of random X-inactivation .
After corticosteroid suppression of her blood eosinophilia , a clonal population of eosinophils could no longer be detected in purified eosinophils .
In contrast , eosinophils purified from a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome and from six patients with reactive eosinophilias attributed to allergy , parasitic infection , or drug reaction showed a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation by HUMARA analysis .
The finding of clonal eosinophilia in a patient presenting with IHES indicates that such patients may have , in reality , a low-grade clonal disorder that can be distinguished from reactive eosinophilias by HUMARA analysis .
Further , the method described can be used to monitor disease progression .
Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 , and Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with BV .
G. vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate HIV expression in monocytoid cells .
Stimulation was significantly higher when lysates were heated at 100 degrees C for 5 min but was reduced by treatment with lysozyme or protease .
G. vaginalis lysates also activated HIV expression in certain T cell lines .
G. vaginalis lysates activated HIV long-terminal repeat transcription in HIV-infected cells and increased NF-kappaB binding activity , indicating an effect by G. vaginalis on HIV transcription .
The activation of HIV production by G. vaginalis suggests that genital tract infection with G. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by increasing HIV expression in the genital tract .
This may explain , at least in part , the increased rate of HIV transmission in women with BV .
Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells , promoting IgE synthesis by B cells .
The molecular basis for increased IL-4 gene expression in atopy is not fully understood .
IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors , of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells .
Recently , a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse .
In a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts of highly polarized Th2 clones from atopics and Th1 clones from controls we compared DNA-binding activities at the two NFAT-binding elements P0 and P1 of the crucial proximal human IL-4 promoter .
At the most proximal P0 site , NFAT-containing complexes devoid of NFAT2 were readily inducible in the Th1 clones , but hardly or not in the Th2 clones .
In contrast , both in Th1 and Th2 clones NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the P1 site , consisting of NFAT2 and a P0-compatible NFAT activity , without apparent differences between Th1 and Th2 clones .
Like in Th2 clones , suppressed NFAT-P0 complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum IgE levels , but not in control PBMC .
These findings suggest that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level .
The transcription factor NF-ATc is synthesized in three prominent isoforms .
These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis .
Due to a switch from the use of a 3' polyA site to a more proximal polyA site , NF-ATc expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in naive T cells to that of short isoform A in T effector cells .
The relative low binding affinity of cleavage stimulation factor CstF-64 to the proximal polyA site seems to contribute to its neglect in naive T cells .
These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of NF-ATc necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of NF-ATc for gene induction in effector T cells .
The Th2-type cytokines , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) , induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes , including FcepsilonRIIb ( CD23 ) , 15-lipoxygenase , IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) , and type I and type II IL-1 receptors ( IL-1R ) .
Type I interferons ( IFN-alpha and IFN-beta ) and type II interferon ( IFN-gamma ) inhibit induction of these genes by IL-4 and IL-13 .
However , the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has not been defined .
In this overview , we discuss the role of the transcription factor , STAT6 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 ) in mediating IL-4- and IL-13-induced gene expression in monocytes .
We also discuss our recent findings that type I and type II IFNs suppress IL-4/IL-13-inducible gene expression by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 .
The ability of type I and type II IFNs to inhibit IL-4/IL-13-induced STAT6 activity is dose- and time-dependent , and is not unique to monocytes because IFNs induce the same effects in fibroblasts .
Inhibition of STAT6 activity is not evident unless cells are preincubated with IFN for at least 1 h before IL-4 stimulation .
Furthermore , inhibition can be blocked by actinomycin D , indicating a requirement for de novo transcription .
We propose a model in which stimulation of monocytes by IFN activates de novo synthesis of an inhibitory factor , possibly one or more members of the SOCS/ SSI/CIS gene family , capable of suppressing activation of STAT6 by IL-4 and IL-13 .
Because STAT6 activation plays an essential role in IL-4/IL-13-induced gene expression , the ability of IFN-beta and IFN-gamma to inhibit STAT6 activity provides an explanation for how IFNs can suppress IL-4/IL-13-inducible gene expression .
TRAF2 is a signal transducing adaptor molecule which binds to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain .
We have found that it is phosphorylated , predominantly on serine residues , when transiently overexpressed in 293 cells .
The phosphorylation appears to be related to the signaling events that are activated by TRAF2 under these circumstances , since two nonfunctional mutants were found to be phosphorylated significantly less than the wild-type protein .
Furthermore , the phosphorylation status of TRAF2 had significant effects on the ability of the protein to bind to CD40 , as evidenced by our observations that the CD40 cytoplasmic domain interacted preferentially with underphosphorylated TRAF2 and that phosphatase treatment significantly enhanced the binding of TRAF2 to CD40 .
We conclude from these studies that the phosphorylation of TRAF2 is likely to play an important role in regulating signaling by virtue of its ability to influence the CD40-TRAF2 interaction .

DQalpha and DQbeta trans heterodimeric HLA-DQ molecules form in individuals heterozygous for the DQ2 and DQ8 specificities .
Unique functions and disease associations have been postulated for such trans-dimers , which may be different from cis-encoded DQ molecules encoded by the corresponding haplotypes .
We analyzed the ability of the trans-dimer encoded by HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0302 to bind a peptide antigen which interacts with DQ molecules encoded by both parental haplotypes .
Markedly impaired binding was observed , consistent with both the use of different anchor residues and with changes in levels of DQ cis-dimer availability for peptide binding interactions .
Previous studies have implicated a role for intracellular thiols in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and transcriptional regulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules .
This study was designed to determine whether changes in endothelial cell glutathione ( GSH ) or oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) can alter neutrophil adhesivity and to define the molecular mechanism that underlies this GSSG/GSH-induced adhesion response .
Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers for 6 hours with 0.2 mmol/L diamide and 1 mmol/L buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) decreased GSH levels and increased the ratio of GSSG to GSH without cell toxicity .
These redox changes are similar to those observed with anoxia/reoxygenation .
Diamide plus BSO-induced thiol/disulfide imbalance was associated with a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs with peak responses observed at 15 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) .
N-Acetylcysteine treatment attenuated neutrophil adhesion in both phases , which indicated a role for GSH in the adhesion responses .
Interestingly , phase 1 adhesion was inversely correlated with GSH levels but not with the GSSG/GSH ratio , whereas phase 2 neutrophil adhesion was positively correlated with GSSG/GSH ratio but not with GSH levels .
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin-specific monoclonal antibodies attenuated the increased neutrophil adhesion during both phases , whereas an anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody also attenuated the phase 2 response .
Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides that contained nuclear factor-kappaB or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated the phase 2 response , which implicated a role for de novo protein synthesis .
Surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , P-selectin , and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase 1 and 2 neutrophil adhesion responses .
This study demonstrates that changes in endothelial cell GSSG/GSH cause transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules , which leads to a 2-phase neutrophil-endothelial adhesion response .
MDS1/EVI1 , located on chromosome 3 band q26 , encodes a zinc-finger DNA-binding transcription activator not detected in normal hematopoietic cells but expressed in several normal tissues .
MDS1/EVI1 is inappropriately activated in myeloid leukemias following chromosomal rearrangements involving band 3q26 .
The rearrangements lead either to gene truncation , and to expression of the transcription repressor EVI1 , as seen in the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26) , or to gene fusion , as seen in the t(3;21)(q26;q22) which results in the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 .
This fusion protein contains the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor AML1 fused in-frame to the entire MDS1/EVI1 with the exclusion of its first 12 amino acids .
In this report , we have analyzed the response of the hematopoietic precursor cell line 32Dcl3 , expressing either the normal protein MDS1/EVI1 or the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 , to factors that control cell differentiation or cell replication .
The 32Dcl3 cells are IL-3-dependent for growth and they differentiate into granulocytes when exposed to G-CSF .
They are growth-inhibited by TGF-beta1 .
We show that whereas the expression of MDS1/EVI1 has no effect on granulocytic differentiation induced by G-CSF , expression of AML1/MDS1/EVI1 blocks differentiation resulting in cell death .
This effect is similar to that previously described by others for 32Dcl3 cells that express transgenic Evil .
Furthermore , we show that whereas the expression of the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 completely abrogates the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 and allows 32Dcl3 cells to proliferate , expression of the normal protein MDS1/EVI1 has the opposite effect , and it strengthens the response of cells to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 .
By using the yeast two-hybrid system , we also show that EVI1 ( contained in its entirety in MDS1/EVI1 and AML1/MDS1/EVI1 ) physically interacts with SMAD3 , which is an intracellular mediator of TGF-beta1 signaling .
Finally , we have correlated the response of the cells to G-CSF or TGF-beta1 with the ability of the normal and fusion proteins to activate or repress promoters which they can directly regulate by binding to the promoter site .
We propose that mutations of MDS1/EVI1 either by gene truncation resulting in the transcription repressor EVI1 or by gene fusion to AML1 lead to an altered cellular response to growth and differentiation factors that could result in leukemic transformation .
The different response of myeloid cells ectopically expressing the normal or the fusion protein to G-CSF and TGF-beta1 could depend on the different transactivation properties of these proteins resulting in divergent expression of downstream genes regulated by the two proteins .
Type I interferons ( IFNs ) are a family of cytokines that have antiviral and antiproliferative effects .
Data regarding the processes by which these cytokines transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are becoming increasingly complex .
The most characterized pathway is via JAK-STAT signaling .
Previous studies established a potential role for the Src-family kinase Lck in JAK-STAT signaling .
Therefore , this study was designed to analyze the role of Lck in IFN-alpha signaling by using the Jurkat , JCam ( an Lck-defective cell line derived from Jurkat ) , and JCam/Lck ( JCam cells with Lck restored ) .
The results show that IFN-alpha can induce MAPK activity , but only in cells containing Lck .
Furthermore , STATs1 and -3 are effectively phosphorylated and activated to bind DNA in the absence of Lck expression in IFN-alpha-treated cells .
Finally , the results demonstrate that IFN-alpha exerts an antiproliferative effect in all three cell lines .
These data indicate that Lck and active MAPK do not affect IFN-alpha-induced growth arrest or induction of STAT1s1 and -3 DNA binding ability .

Induction of NFkappaB is a highly regulated process requiring phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IkappaBalpha .
Analyses of the regulation of IkappaBalpha in TNF-alpha-treated T lymphocytes from young and elderly donors revealed severely compromised degradation of IkappaBalpha in T cells from the elderly .
Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha did not demonstrate any significant age-related alterations .
However , examination of proteasome activity in these T cells using fluorogenic peptide assays revealed a significant age-related decline in chymotryptic activity .
These results suggest that a decline in proteasome activity results in a failure to fully degrade IkappaBalpha in the elderly .
This failure to degrade IkappaBalpha may underlie both the observed decrease in NFkappaB induction and the IL-2 receptor expression in TNF-treated T cells during aging .
Thus , decreased proteasome-mediated degradation may be central to immune dysfunction that accompanies aging .

Our investigations have focused on localizing cis-elements responsible for the down regulation of the adult beta-like globin genes ( delta and beta ) in immature , or primitive erythroid tissues .
We studied their activity after transfection into K562 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line with an embryonic-fetal phenotype .
Analyzed DNA sequences included delta and beta 5' flanking regions extending from approximately -500 to +50bp ( promoter regions ) , truncated delta and beta 5' flanking regions extending from approximately -250 to +50 bp , and chimeric promoter constructions , which consisted of a distal delta or beta fragment fused to a proximal beta or delta sequence .
In CAT reporter constructions no appreciable level of CAT activity was supported by the beta globin promoter , and only low level activity by the delta promoter .
Truncation of the beta globin promoter led to a 2-3 fold increase in promoter activity .
In contrast , deletion of the upstream portion of the delta promoter led to a 10 fold decrease in expression .
Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity , consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element ( s ) .
Fusion of the upstream portion of the delta promoter to the truncated beta globin promoter yielded a modest increase in promoter strength relative to the truncated beta gene promoter , indicating the presence of a positive transcriptional element ( s ) in the upstream delta globin regulatory region .
Site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites for the repressor proteins BP1 and BP2 in the upstream portion of the beta globin gene flanking region led to a 4-6 fold increase in promoter activity .
DNase I footprinting of the upstream delta-globin region revealed protected sequences corresponding to consensus binding sites for GATA-1 and BP2 .
These results confirm that sequences in the upstream promoter region of the adult beta globin gene contribute to its factor-mediated suppression early in development and then may modulate its expression at a later stage .
Somatic hypermutation is the most critical mechanism underlying the diversification of Ig genes .
Although mutation occurs specifically in B cells during the germinal center reaction , it remains a matter of debate whether the mutation machinery also targets non-Ig genes .
We have studied mutations in the 5' noncoding region of the Bcl6 gene in different subtypes of lymphomas .
We found frequent hypermutation in follicular lymphoma ( 25 of 59 = 42 % ) ( germinal center cell origin ) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma ( 19 of 45 = 42 % ) ( postgerminal center ) , but only occasionally in mantle cell lymphoma ( 1 of 21 = 4.8 % ) ( pregerminal center ) .
Most mutations were outside the motifs potentially important for transcription , suggesting they were not important in lymphomagenesis but may , like Ig mutation , represent an inherent feature of the lymphoma precursor cells .
Therefore , we investigated their normal cell counterparts microdissected from a reactive tonsil .
Bcl6 mutation was found in 13 of 24 ( 54 % ) clones from the germinal centre but only in 1 of 24 ( 4 % ) clones from the naive B cells of the mantle zone .
The frequency , distribution , and nature of these mutations were similar to those resulting from the Ig hypermutation process .
The results show unequivocal evidence of non-Ig gene hypermutation in germinal center B cells and provide fresh insights into the process of hypermutation and lymphomagenesis .
Apoptosis induced through the TCR in CD4+ T cells is mostly mediated by the inducible expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) as a primary event leading to the commitment to death .
To gain a better understanding of the transcriptional events that regulate this expression , we took advantage of our previously described mutant Jurkat cells .
These cells are deficient in FasL expression and apoptosis induced upon TCR triggering , although their cytokine ( IL-2 and IFN-gamma ) production is normal .
Here we show that both a FasL- and a consensus NF-kappaB- reporter construct are inefficiently induced in these cells compared to wild-type cells .
In addition , we demonstrate that the inducible transcriptional activity of the FasL reporter is abolished by specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation .
Thus , we could trace the deficit of the mutant cells to an inefficient NF-kappaB activation , evidencing a relevant role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of FasL expression in activated T cells .
Furthermore , our results suggest that the induction of FasL versus cytokine gene expression is differentially sensitive to NF-kappaB deprivation .
We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .
This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the NF-kappa B inhibitor I kappa B alpha ( mut-I kappa B ) and to study the maturation defects occurring when NF-kappa B activation is inhibited during fetal development .
Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B were found to develop normally until the CD44-CD25+ , CD4-CD8- double-negative stage , while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased .
Proliferation , as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal , as did rearrangement and expression of the TCR beta-chain .
However , apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B than in FTOC infected with a control virus .
Taken together , these results suggest that NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of thymocytes in the early stages of their development .
Here , we report the functional expression of CD40 on human malignant melanomas ( MMs ) .
Comparison of tumor specimen from MM precursor lesions , primary tumors , and metastases revealed that CD40 surface expression is down-regulated during tumor progression .
CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases , whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative .
CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not by interleukin ( IL ) -1beta or CD40 triggering .
CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-a , and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB .
Furthermore , CD40 ligation of a HLA-A2+ , MelanA/MART1+ MM cell line enhanced its susceptibility to specific lysis by a HLA-A2-restricted , MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone .
Finally , CD40 ligation induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM .
These results indicate that CD40-CD40L interactions may play an important role in augmenting antitumor immunity and inducing apoptosis in some CD40-positive immunogenic human MMs .
Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of HNF1 ( PCD/DCoH ) is a dual-function protein .
In the cytoplasm it acts as a dehydratase in the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin , the cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases .
In the nucleus , it functions as a dimerization cofactor of HNF1 and increases the transcriptional activity of HNF1 .
To deepen our understanding of this protein , we characterized its expression in human tissues and cells .
Human PCD/DCoH was present predominantly in liver and kidney , with significant amounts in testis and ovary , trace amounts in lung , and undetectable levels in whole brain , heart , and spleen .
It was expressed in all of the cells that were examined .
Importantly , it was also present in the nucleus of HeLa cells , which lack HNF1 , and in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts that have little or no tetrahydrobiopterin .
The expression of human PCD/DCoH in the liver and nonhepatic cells was compared at both the mRNA and protein levels .
Although the mRNA level in liver was only fourfold higher than that in keratinocytes and fibroblasts , the hepatic PCD/DCoH protein level was 20-fold higher than that in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts .
Cloning of the 5' and 3' untranslated region ( UTR ) of human keratinocyte PCD/DCoH revealed that it has 53 bp more of GC-rich 5' untranslated sequence than the published liver PCD/DCoH .
In vitro transcription and translation analysis showed that the longer 5' UTR resulted in about a 35 % decrease in translation efficiency .
These data show that human PCD/DCoH is not only present in cells where tetrahydrobiopterin is synthesized or HNF1 is present but is a widely distributed protein .
Its differential expression in different tissues and cells is regulated not only at the transcriptional level but also at the translational level .
Allelic variation at the 3'-end of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene has been associated with a 3-5-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization .
This genetic diversity does not alter the VDR protein structurally , but instead may be a marker ( s ) of other , nearby polymorphisms that influence message stability or translation .
The work reported here was instigated to identify additional VDR 3'-UTR polymorphisms that may have functional significance and to then test whether these genetic variants alter message stability .
Initially , four novel , frequently occurring sequence variants were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously .
These common sequence variants were not found within three message-destabilizing elements that we mapped within the 3'-UTR of the vitamin D receptor mRNA .
Furthermore , the two VDR 3'-UTR haplotypes conferred an identical half-life on a heterologous beta-globin reporter gene , in an in vitro assay .
We therefore conclude that common polymorphisms within the VDR 3'-UTR do not influence message stability .
Apoptosis is instrumental in the processes generating the diversity of the B-cell repertoire .
Autoreactive B-cells are eliminated by anti-IgM crosslinking after encountering self-antigens , but precise mechanisms leading to B-cell apoptosis are still not well understood .
We report here the cleavage of the transcription factor SP1 in the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60 during anti-IgM-induced apoptosis .
Western blot analysis revealed two cleavage products of approximately 68 kDa and 45 kDa after induction of apoptosis .
Cleavage could be completely inhibited by zDEVD-fmk , an inhibitor specific for caspase 3-like proteases .
In-vitro cleavage of recombinant SP1 by recombinant caspase 3 ( CPP32 ) or caspase 7 ( Mch 3 ) results in similar cleavage products as those observed in vivo .
Recombinant caspase 6 ( Mch 2 ) primarily generates a 68-kDa cleavage product , as observed after calcium ionophore ( CaI ) induced B-cell apoptosis .
In contrast , caspase 1 ( ICE ) did not cleave SP1 in vitro .
The time course of SP1 cleavage during anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is paralleled by an increase of caspase activity measured by DEVD-p-nitroanilide ( DEVD-pNA ) cleavage .
DNA band-shift assays revealed a decrease in the intensity of the full length SP1/DNA complex and an increase in the intensity of a smaller complex due to the binding of one SP1 cleavage product .
By Edman sequencing we could identify a caspase 3 cleavage site after Asp584 ( D584AQPQAGR ) , generating a 22-kDa C-terminal SP1 protein fragment which still contains the DNA binding site .
Our results show the cleavage of the human transcription factor SP1 in vivo and in vitro , underlining the central role of caspase 3-like proteases during the process of anti-IgM-induced apoptosis .
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) is essential for the later stages of erythropoiesis , acting to promote cell survival and proliferation , but its role in differentiation remains to be defined .
The UT-7 cell line exhibits both erythroid and megakaryocytic characteristics and can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid pathway by Epo or the megakaryocytic pathway by phorbol myristic acetate .
We have compared the effects of Epo and the chemical inducers , delta-aminolaevulinic acid ( delta-ALA ) and haemin on the differentiation capacity of UT-7 cells .
Epo alone promoted relatively early events in erythroid maturation , without significant changes in haemoglobin production or morphology .
GATA-2 and c-myb were down-regulated by Epo , and GATA-2 was further down-modulated by the inducers .
Conversely , SCL expression was up-regulated by Epo and further increased by haemin and delta-ALA .
Epo caused an increase in the proportion of cells expressing cell surface glycophorin A ( GPA ) and up-regulated beta- and gamma-globin by several fold .
Both haemin and delta-ALA caused a de novo increase in alpha-globin expression as well as enhancing Epo-induced beta-globin expression , leading to a marked increase in haemoglobin production .
These results suggest that haemoglobin production in UT-7 cells is limited by a deficiency of erythroid-specific aminolaevulinic acid synthase ( ALAS-E ) activity or globin synthesis as a consequence of their immaturity as a multipotential cell line .
Soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha ( IL-2Ralpha ) has been reported to be increased in the sera of patients with advanced tuberculosis , and levels decline after therapy in accordance with improvement of radiologic findings .
We investigated expression of the IL-2Ralpha in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells in active pulmonary tuberculosis , and evaluated the mechanism Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces in the IL-2Ralpha using the THP-1 mononuclear phagocyte cell line .
We found IL-2Ralpha expression to be increased in BAL cells from involved sites of active pulmonary tuberculosis .
Expression of the alpha-chain of IL-2Ralpha on peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) was induced by M. tuberculosis by flow cytometry evaluation .
Northern analysis demonstrated increased IL-2Ralpha gene expression after stimulation with M. tuberculosis which was further induced by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
The IL-2Ralpha promoter containing the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) site was transcriptionally induced by M. tuberculosis and this NF-kappaB site could confer inducibility to a heterologous herpes thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter by M. tuberculosis .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) revealed specific binding of nuclear protein to the NF-kappaB site upon induction with M. tuberculosis .
Using antibodies against the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB in EMSAs , the involvement of both p50 and p65 proteins was further demonstrated .
Functional expression of the IL-2Ralpha on mononuclear phagocytes in M. tuberculosis infection may play an important immunomodulatory role in the host response .
Glycoprotein ( GP ) IX is a subunit of the von Willebrand receptor , GPIb-V-IX , which mediates adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium of damaged blood vessels .
Previous characterization of the GPIX promoter identified a functional Ets site that , when disrupted , reduced promoter activity .
However , the Ets protein ( s ) that regulated GPIX promoter expression was unknown .
In this study , transient cotransfection of several GPIX promoter/reporter constructs into 293T kidney fibroblasts with a Fli-1 expression vector shows that the oncogenic protein Fli-1 can transactivate the GPIX promoter when an intact GPIX Ets site is present .
In addition , Fli-1 binding of the GPIX Ets site was identified in antibody supershift experiments in nuclear extracts derived from hematopoietic human erythroleukemia cells .
Comparative studies showed that Fli-1 was also able to transactivate the GPIbalpha and , to a lesser extent , the GPIIb promoter .
Immunoblot analysis identified Fli-1 protein in lysates derived from platelets .
In addition , expression of Fli-1 was identified immunohistochemically in megakaryocytes derived from CD34(+) cells treated with the megakaryocyte differentiation and proliferation factor , thrombopoietin .
These results suggest that Fli-1 is likely to regulate lineage-specific genes during megakaryocytopoiesis .
The STP oncoproteins of the herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) subgroup A strain 11 and subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) 1 , 2 , or 3 .
Mutational analyses identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association .
In addition , a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF association .
Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-kappaB activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs .
The HVS STP-C488 P10 --> R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo .
The STP-C488 P10 --> R mutant was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation , and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant .
These data implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen .
Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions .
In this study , we characterized C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of endothelial cells and demonstrated an enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of leukocytes ( monocytes , granulocytes ) .
These effects were blocked by mAbs against endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules ( beta1 and beta2 integrins ) .
Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in C. pneumoniae-infected endothelial cells was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and NF-kappaB activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min .
Increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted within hours .
Thus , C. pneumoniae triggers a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial activation , inflammation , and thrombosis , which in turn may result in or may promote atherosclerosis .
Increased activity of various proteases is observed in both human and experimental pancreatitis ; however , the information on the effects of specific protease inhibitors on the disease is limited .
In this study we show that a novel elastase inhibitor , guamerin-derived synthetic peptide ( GDSP ) , improves the parameters of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat .
The effects of GDSP on pancreatic weight , serum amylase and lipase , morphologic changes in the pancreas , neutrophil infiltration , and nuclear factor KB ( NF-KB ) activation were measured in rats infused with supramaximal dose of cerulein ( 5 ( g/kg/h ) for 6 h .
The effects of GDSP were also measured on superoxide formation by activated human neutrophils .
The effects of GDSP were compared with those of another elastase inhibitor , elastatinal .
GDSP significantly inhibited edema formation , neutrophil infiltration , acinar cell damage , and plasma lipase and amylase increases caused by cerulein .
GDSP also completely inhibited superoxide formation in the human neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenyl-alanine ( fMLP ) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
Elastatinal had some of the same effects as GDSP but was less potent and effective .
These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of GDSP , a novel specific elastase inhibitor , on the development of rat cerulein pancreatitis .
The multiple biologic activities of retinoic acid ( RA ) are mediated through RAR and retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) nuclear receptors that interact with specific DNA target sequences as heterodimers ( RXR-RAR ) or homodimers ( RXR-RXR ) .
RA receptor activation appears critical to regulating important aspects of hematopoiesis , since transducing a COOH-terminally truncated RARalpha exhibiting dominant-negative activity ( RARalpha403 ) into normal mouse bone marrow generates hematopoietic growth factor-dependent cell lines frozen at the multipotent progenitor ( EML ) or committed promyelocyte ( MPRO ) stages .
Nevertheless , relatively high , pharmacological concentrations of RA ( 1 to 10 & mgr ; M ) overcome these differentiation blocks and induce terminal granulocytic differentiation of the MPRO promyelocytes while potentiating interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -induced commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte/monocyte lineage .
In the present study , we utilized RXR- and RAR-specific agonists and antagonists to determine how RA overcomes the dominant-negative activity of the truncated RARalpha in these different myeloid developmental stages .
Unexpectedly , we observed that an RXR-specific , rather than an RAR-specific , agonist induces terminal granulocytic differentiation of MPRO promyelocytes , and this differentiation is associated with activation of DNA response elements corresponding to RAR-RXR heterodimers rather than RXR-RXR homodimers .
This RXR agonist activity is blocked by RAR-specific antagonists , suggesting extensive cross-talk between the partners of the RXR -RARalpha403 heterodimer .
In contrast , in the more immature , multipotent EML cells we observed that this RXR-specific agonist is inactive either in potentiating IL-3-mediated commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte lineage or in transactivating RAR-RXR response elements .
RA- triggered GALdbd-RARalpha hybrid activity in these cells indicates that the multipotent EML cells harbor substantial nuclear hormone receptor coactivator activity .
However , the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A readily activates an RXR-RAR reporter construct in the multipotent EML cells but not in the committed MPRO promyelocytes , indicating that differences in HDAC-containing repressor complexes in these two closely related but distinct hematopoietic lineages might account for the differential activation of the RXR-RARalpha403 heterodimers that we observed at these different stages of myeloid development .
The renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .
A common feature of all stages of atherosclerosis is inflammation of the vessel wall .
The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation .
This study therefore examined the effect of angiotensin ( ANG ) II on NF-kappaB activation in monocytic cells , a major cellular component of human atheroma , by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
ANG II , like TNFalpha , caused rapid activation of NF-kappaB in human mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density gradient .
This ANG II effect was blocked by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan .
Specificity of ANG II-induced NF-kappaB activation was ascertained by supershift and competition experiments .
Moreover , ANG II stimulated NF-kappaB activation in human monocytes , but not in lymphocytes from the same preparation .
Together , the data demonstrate the ability of the vasoactive peptide ANG II to activate inflammatory pathways in human monocytes .

BACKGROUND : Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) is an important mediator of septic shock .
Endotoxin ( LPS ) signal transduction in human monocytes leads to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) and TNF-alpha release .
Previous studies have implicated activation of both protein kinase C ( PKC ) and protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) in LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha production .
We hypothesized that inhibition of either PKC or PTK would decrease LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and TNF-alpha release in human monocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Human monocytes were stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) alone or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) with and without a nonspecific serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine ( Stauro ) , a specific pan-PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide ( Bis ) , or an inhibitor of PTK genistein ( Gen ) .
TNF-alpha release in culture supernatants was measured by an ELISA .
NF-kappaB DNA binding was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
RESULTS : LPS increased NF-kappaB DNA binding and TNF-alpha release in human monocytes .
Nonspecific protein kinase inhibition inhibited NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha release , while specific PKC inhibition with Bis had no effect on LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding or TNF-alpha release .
PTK inhibition with Gen attenuated both LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and TNF-alpha production in human monocytes .
Direct activation of PKC with PMA induced both NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha production by human monocytes .
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha release in human monocytes are independent of PKC activity .
Furthermore , our results provide evidence that PTK plays a role in LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha release in human monocytes and thus could be a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory states .

The E2A-HLF fusion gene , generated by t(17;19)(q22;p13) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , encodes a chimeric transcription factor in which the trans-activating domains of E2A are fused to the DNA- binding and dimerization domains of hepatic leukemic factor ( HLF ) .
To investigate its biological role , we generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF using Ig enhancer and promoter , which direct transgene expression in cells committed to the lymphoid lineage .
The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection .
The thymus contained small numbers of thymocytes , and TUNEL staining showed that higher population of thymocytes were undergoing apoptosis .
The spleen exhibited a marked reduction in splenic lymphocytes and the flow cytometric analyses and the in vitro colony formation assays showed that the B-cell maturation was blocked at a very early developmental stage .
These findings indicated that the expression of E2A-HLF induced T-cell apoptosis and B-cell maturation arrest in vivo and that the susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection was due to immunodeficiency .
Moreover , several transgenic mice developed acute leukemia , classified as T-ALL based on the surface marker analysis and DNA rearrangements , suggesting that an additional event is required for malignant transformation of lymphoid cells expressing E2A-HLF .
Our findings provide insight into the biological function of E2A-HLF in lymphoid development and also its role in leukemogenesis .
Germline C gamma gene transcription is a crucial event in the process that leads to switch DNA recombination to IgG , but its regulation in the human is poorly understood .
We took advantage of our monoclonal model of germinal center B cell differentiation , IgM+ IgD+ CL-01 cells , to define the role of the I gamma 3 evolutionarily conserved sequence ( ECS ) in the germline transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .
The I gamma 3 ECS lies upstream of the major I gamma 3 transcription initiation site and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding human I gamma 1 , I gamma 2 , and I gamma 4 regions .
Reporter luciferase gene vectors containing the human gamma 3 ECS were used to transfect CL-01 cells , which have been shown to undergo Smu --> S gamma 3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of CD40 by CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) and exposure to IL-4 .
In these transfected CL-01 cells , CD40:CD40L engagement and exposure to IL-4 synergistically induced gamma 3 ECS-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation .
Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem NF-kappa B/Rel binding motif is critical for the gamma 3 ECS responsiveness to both CD40L and IL-4 , while a STAT-6-binding site is additionally required for IL-4 inducibility .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that p50/p65/c-Rel and STAT-6 are effectively induced by CD40L and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to specific DNA motifs within the ECS .
These partially overlapping CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation .
Thus , the gamma 3 ECS is an inducible promoter containing cis elements that critically mediate CD40L and IL-4-triggered transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .
Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is manifested as atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the allograft .
HLA class I Ags have been implicated to play a major role in this process , since signaling via HLA class I molecules can induce the proliferation of aortic endothelial as well as smooth muscle cells .
In this study , we show that HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation correlates with inactivation of the Rb protein in the T cell line Jurkat as well as human aortic endothelial cells .
HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb can be inhibited specifically by neutralizing Abs to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , suggesting a role for FGF receptors in the signaling process .
Signaling through HLA class I molecules induced cyclin E-associated kinase activity within 4 h in quiescent endothelial cells , and appeared to mediate the inactivation of Rb .
A cdk2 inhibitor , Olomoucine , as well as a dominant-negative cdk2 construct prevented HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb ; in contrast , dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs had no effect .
Furthermore , there was no increase in cyclin D-associated kinase activity upon HLA class I ligation , suggesting that cyclin E-dependent kinase activity mediates Rb inactivation , leading to E2F activation and cell proliferation .
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) -insensitive asthma is a challenging clinical problem that can be associated with life-threatening disease progression .
The molecular basis of GC insensitivity is unknown .
Alternative splicing of the GC receptor ( GCR ) pre-mRNA generates a second GCR , termed GCRbeta , which does not bind GC but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR .
Thus increased expression of GCRbeta could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity .
Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were examined for GCRbeta immunoreactivity using a GCRbeta-specific antibody by immunohistochemical staining .
Cell localization of GCRbeta expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique .
Patients with GC-insensitive asthma expressed a significantly higher number of GCRbeta-immunoreactive cells in their BAL and peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal control subjects .
Furthermore , GCRbeta expression in GC-insensitive asthma was particularly high in airway T cells , which are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma .
We also examined the expression of GCRbeta in specimens from the airways of patients with chronic bronchitis .
In chronic bronchitis , few cells were GCRbeta-positive and their numbers did not differ significantly from normal control subjects .
We conclude that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with increased expression of GCRbeta in airway T cells .
Programmed cell death is a process required for the normal development of an organism .
One of the best understood apoptotic pathways occurs in T lymphocytes and is mediated by Fas/Fas ligand ( FasL ) interaction .
During studies of apoptosis induced by T cell-receptor engagement , we identified ALG-4F , a truncated transcript that prevents T cell-receptor-induced FasL upregulation and cell death .
Overexpression of full-length ALG-4 induced transcription of FasL and , consequently , apoptosis .
These results indicate that ALG-4 is necessary and sufficient for FasL expression .
Fas/FasL interaction initiates cell death in many other systems , and its dysregulation is a mechanism by which several pathologic conditions arise .
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of FasL regulation could be very useful in elucidating how these diseases develop and in identifying potential therapeutic targets .
To determine activation status of the IL-2R-associated ( Jak/STAT ) pathway in the HTLV-I infected cells , we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 , STAT3 , and STAT5 in several HTLV-I(+) T-cell lines and in uncultured leukemic T cells isolated from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia ( ATLL ) .
Constitutive basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and , usually , STAT3 and STAT5 was detected in all four IL-2-independent cell lines tested , but in none of the three IL-2-dependent cell lines .
Similarly , there was no detectable basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5 in the leukemic cells from ATLL patients ( 0/8 and 0/3 , respectively ) .
However , stimulation with IL-2 resulted in Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in both leukemic ATLL cells and IL-2-dependent lines .
Furthermore , expression of SHP-1 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling , was lost in most IL-2 independent cell lines ( 3/4 ) but not in the leukemic ATLL cells ( 0/3 ) .
Finally , the HTLV-I(+) T-cell lines ( 313 ) but not the control , HTLV-I(-) T-cell lines were resistant to rapamycin and its novel analog RAD .
We conclude that ( 1 ) HTLV-I infection per se does not result in a constitutive phosphorylation of the Jak3 , STAT3 , and STAT5 proteins ; ( 2 ) malignant transformation in at least some cases of ATLL does not require the constitutive , but may require IL-2-induced , activation of the IL-2R Jak/STAT pathway ; and ( 3 ) there are major differences in T-cell immortalization mechanism ( s ) which appear to involve SHP-1 and target molecules for rapamycin and RAD .
Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) are heparin-binding proteins crucial to embryogenesis , angiogenesis , and wound healing .
FGF-1 is abundantly expressed in the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis and in rejecting allografts , sites of chronic immune-mediated inflammation .
The frequency of FGF-1-responsive T cells is increased in the peripheral blood of these disorders , and a high percentage of infiltrating T cells in rheumatoid arthritis synovium express receptors for FGF-1 .
To understand the action of FGF-1 in T cells , studies were initiated in Jurkat T cells that express the signaling isoform of FGF receptor-1 .
These experiments show that FGF-1 stimulation of Jurkat T cells provides a second signal that augments TCR-mediated IL-2 production .
Analogous to costimulation via CD28 , this activity is mediated through activation of Rel/kappaB , a family of transcription factors known to regulate IL-2 and other activation-inducible proteins .
FGF-1 alone induces modest nuclear translocation of kappaB-binding proteins , and this translocation is enhanced by the combination of anti-CD3 and FGF-1 .
This NF-kappaB binding complex is composed of transcriptionally active p65 ( RelA ) /p50 heterodimers and results primarily from the targeted degradation of IkappaB-alpha , an inhibitor that sequesters Rel/kappaB in the cytoplasm .
These data are the first to show a connection between FGF-1 signaling and NF-kappaB activation outside of embryonic development .
The signaling events that link FGF receptor-1 engagement and NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat are probably distinct from the CD28 costimulation pathway , since FGF-1-induced Rel/kappaB binding proteins do not contain significant levels of c-Rel and are not identical with the CD28 response complex .
The level of ongoing HIV-1 replication within an individual is critical to HIV-1 pathogenesis .
Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF-alpha has previously been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems .
Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the TNF receptor family member , the lymphotoxin-beta ( LT-beta ) receptor ( LT-betaR ) , also regulates HIV-1 replication .
Furthermore , HIV-1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT-betaR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands .
Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that membrane-bound TNF-alpha and LT-alpha1beta2 act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV-1 replication .
Thus , cosignaling via the LT-beta and TNF-alpha receptors is probably involved in the modulation of HIV-1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV-1 viral burden in monocytes .
Intriguingly , surface expression of LT-alpha1beta2 is up- regulated on a T cell line acutely infected with HIV-1 , suggesting a positive feedback loop between HIV-1 infection , LT-alpha1beta2 expression , and HIV-1 replication .
Given the critical role that LT-alpha1beta2 plays in lymphoid architecture , we speculate that LT-alpha1beta2 may be involved in HIV-associated abnormalities of the lymphoid organs .
TNF is one of the cytokines secreted by the cells of the immune system .
Our data demonstrate that those cell lines lacking capability to form metastatic tumors in vivo are susceptible to TNF induced apoptosis in vitro .
However , cell lines with high metastatic potential are resistant to TNF in vitro .
Furthermore , the same cell lines were resistant to cytolytic action of other cytotoxic proteins secreted by LAK cells .
Our data showed that TNF resistance in vitro correlates with the increased level of transcription factor NF-kappaB .
This finding may provide a tool to improve current protocols of immunotherapy and insights to how tumor cells are or are not killed by LAK cells .
Targeted expression to specific tissues or cell lineages is a necessary feature of a gene therapy vector for many clinical applications , such as correction of hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells .
We developed retroviral vectors in which the constitutive viral enhancer in the U3 region of the 3' LTR is replaced by an autoregulatory enhancer of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene .
The replaced enhancer is propagated to the 5' LTR upon integration into the target cell genome .
The modified vectors were used to transduce human hematopoietic cell lines , cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells , and murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells .
The expression of appropriate reporter genes ( triangle upLNGFR , EGFP ) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of transduced stem cells in vitro , in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay , and in vivo , after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice .
The GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer effectively restricts the expression of the LTR-driven proviral transcription unit to the erythroblastic progeny of both human progenitors and mouse-repopulating stem cells .
Packaging of viral particles , integration into the target genome , and stability of the integrated provirus are not affected by the LTR modification .
Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a retroviral transgene to a specific progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .
In vitro studies on hematopoietic control mechanisms have been hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed cell populations , ie , lack of lineage specificity and developmental stage homogeneity of progenitor/precursor cells growing in culture .
We developed unicellular culture systems for unilineage differentiation of purified hematopoietic progenitor cells followed by daughter cell analysis at cellular and molecular level .
In the culture system reported here , ( 1 ) the growth factor ( GF ) stimulus induces cord blood ( CB ) progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate/mature exclusively along the erythroid lineage ; ( 2 ) this erythropoietic wave is characterized by less than 4 % apoptotic cells ; ( 3 ) asymmetric divisions are virtually absent , ie , nonresponsive hematopoietic progenitors with no erythropoietic potential are forced into apoptosis ; ( 4 ) the system is cell division controlled ( cdc ) , ie , the number of divisions performed by each cell is monitored .
Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was applied to this culture system to investigate gene expression of diverse receptors , markers of differentiation , and transcription factors ( EKLF , GATA-1 , GATA-2 , p45 NF-E2 , PU.1 , and SCL/Tal1 ) at discrete stages of erythropoietic development .
Freshly isolated CD34(+) cells expressed CD34 , c-kit , PU.1 , and GATA-2 but did not express CD36 , erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) , SCL/Tal1 , EKLF , NF-E2 , GATA-1 , or glyocophorin A ( GPA ) .
In early to intermediate stages of erythroid differentiation we monitored the induction of CD36 , Tal1 , EKLF , NF-E2 , and GATA-1 that preceeded expression of EpoR .
In late stages of erythroid maturation , GPA was upregulated , whereas CD34 , c-kit , PU.1 , and GATA-2 were barely or not detected .
In addition , competitive single-cell RT-PCR was used to assay CD34 mRNA transcripts in sibling CD34(+) CD38(-) cells differentiating in unilineage erythroid cultures : this analysis allowed us to semiquantitate the gradual downmodulation of CD34 mRNA from progenitor cells through their differentiating erythroid progeny .
It is concluded that this novel culture system , coupled with single-cell RT-PCR analysis , may eliminate the ambiguities intrinsic to molecular studies on heterogeneous populations of hematopoietic progenitors/precursors growing in culture , particularly in the initial stages of development .
Peptidoglycan ( PGN ) , the major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria , induces secretion of cytokines in macrophages through CD14 , the pattern recognition receptor that binds lipopolysaccharide and other microbial products .
To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of cytokine genes , we wanted to determine which transcription factors are activated by PGN in mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophage cells .
Our results demonstrated that : ( i ) PGN induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB ; ( ii ) ATF-1 and CREB bound DNA as a dimer and induced transcriptional activation of a CRE reporter plasmid , which was inhibited by dominant negative CREB and ATF-1 ; ( iii ) PGN induced phosphorylation of c-Jun , protein synthesis of JunB and c-Fos , and transcriptional activation of the AP-1 reporter plasmid , which was inhibited by dominant negative c-Fos ; and ( iv ) PGN-induced activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 was mediated through CD14 .
This is the first study to demonstrate activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 transcription factors by PGN or by any other component of Gram-positive bacteria .
The contact of natural killer ( NK ) cells with foreign cells and with certain virus-infected or tumor cells triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells .
This triggering leads to exocytosis of the cytotoxic NK cell granules .
The oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are not well understood .
In a model where foreign cells ( rat fibroblasts ) were cocultured with human IL-2 activated NK cells , we observed that NK cells were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene c-Myc or E1A .
Both the parental and the oncogene expressing fibroblasts similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells , demonstrating that NK cells were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts .
The cell death was independent of wild-type p53 and was not inhibited by an anti-apoptotic protein EIB19K .
These results provided evidence that c-Myc and E1A activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction .
In consistence , the c-Myc and E1A overexpressing fibroblasts were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than parental cells .
The data indicate that oncogenes activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules .
This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of NK cells towards the virus-infected and cancer cells .
We recently developed an assay in which nuclear export of the shuttling transcription factor NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) can be reconstituted in permeabilized cells with the GTPase Ran and the nuclear export receptor CRM1 .
We have now used this assay to identify another export factor .
After preincubation of permeabilized cells with a Ran mutant that can not hydrolyze GTP ( RanQ69L ) , cytosol supports NFAT export , but CRM1 and Ran alone do not .
The RanQ69L preincubation leads to accumulation of CRM1 at the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) in association with the p62 complex and Can/Nup214 .
RanGTP-dependent association of CRM1 with these nucleoporins was reconstituted in vitro .
By biochemical fractionation and reconstitution , we showed that RanBP1 restores nuclear export after the RanQ69L preincubation .
It also stimulates nuclear export in cells that have not been preincubated with RanQ69L .
RanBP1 as well as Ran-binding domains of the cytoplasmic nucleoporin RanBP2 promote the release of CRM1 from the NPC .
Taken together , our results indicate that RanGTP is important for the targeting of export complexes to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC and that RanBP1 and probably RanBP2 are involved in the dissociation of nuclear export complexes from the NPC in a terminal step of transport .
Mobilization of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activates transcription of genes encoding endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines that contribute to monocyte infiltration critical in atherogenesis .
Inhibition of NF-kappaB has been achieved by pharmacological and genetic approaches ; however , monocyte interactions with activated endothelium in shear flow following gene transfer of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha have not been studied .
We found that overexpression of IkappaB-alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) and growth-related activity-alpha ( GRO-alpha ) by TNF-alpha .
This was associated with a reduction in endothelial MCP-1 secretion and GRO-alpha immobilization .
Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha-activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression .
Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .
In contrast , rolling of monocytes was increased by IkappaB-alpha transfer and was partly mediated by P-selectin ; however , it appeared to be unaffected by the inhibition of E-selectin induction .
Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF-kappaB by adenoviral transfer of IkappaB-alpha impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques .
To understand the role of NF-kappa B complexes in T cell development and activation , we have generated transgenic mice in which RelA and c-Rel complexes were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha .
Transgene expression did not affect the thymic development , but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes .
Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was not attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes .
In contrast , expression of IL-4 , IL-10 , and IFN-gamma was strongly inhibited in the transgenic T cells .
The proliferative deficiency of the transgenic T cells was associated with an increased apoptosis .
These results point out the involvement of NF-kappa B/Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by either regulating proteins involved in the IL-2 signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression .
The transcription factor NF-ATc that controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and embryonic cardiac cells is expressed in three prominent isoforms .
This is due to alternative splice/polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in naive T cells and a shorter NF-ATc isoform in effector T cells .
Whereas the previously described isoform NF-ATc/A contains a relatively short C terminus , the longer isoforms , B and C , span extra C-terminal peptides of 128 and 246 aa , respectively .
We show here that in addition to the strong N-terminal trans-activation domain , TAD-A , which is common to all three NF-ATc isoforms , NF-ATc/C contains a second trans-activation domain , TAD-B , in its C-terminal peptide .
Various stimuli of T cells that induce the activity of TAD-A also enhance the activity of TAD-B , but , unlike TAD-A , TAD-B remains unphosphorylated by protein from 12-O-tetradecanoyl 12-phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated T cells .
The shorter C-terminal peptide of isoform NF-ATc/B exerts a suppressive transcriptional effect .
These properties of NF-ATc/B and - C might be of importance for gene regulation in naive T lymphocytes in which NF-ATc/B and -C are predominantly synthesized .
Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood .
PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages .
PU.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice .
Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells requires a decline in the level of PU.1 , indicating that PU.1 can block erythroid differentiation .
Here we investigate the mechanism by which PU.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation .
We find that PU.1 interacts directly with GATA-1 , a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation .
Interaction between PU.1 and GATA-1 requires intact DNA-binding domains in both proteins .
PU.1 represses GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation .
Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of PU.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in MEL cells .
We also show that ectopic expression of PU.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development .
Furthermore , introduction of exogenous GATA-1 in both MEL cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by PU.1 .
Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation .
Oxidizing agents are powerful activators of factors responsible for the transcriptional activation of cytokine-encoding genes involved in tissue injury .
In this study we show evidence that STAT3 is a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by H2O2 in human lymphocytes , in which endogenous catalase had previously been inhibited .
H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 to form sequence-specific DNA-bound complexes was evidenced by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , and vanadate was found to strongly synergize with H2O2 .
Moreover , anti-STAT3 antibodies specifically precipitated a protein of 92 kDa that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2 .
Phenylarsine oxide , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , cooperated and cancelled , respectively , the H2O2-promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation .
Evidence is also presented , using Fe2+/Cu2+ ions , that. OH generated from H2O2 through Fenton reactions could be a candidate oxygen reactive species to directly activate STAT3 .
Present data suggest that H2O2 and vanadate are likely to inhibit the activity of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase ( s ) , leading to enhanced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus .
These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 can be modulated by oxidizing agents and provide a framework to understand the effects of oxidative stress on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway .
Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell , the blood monocyte ( monocyte ) , the reason ( s ) for these functional changes have not been determined .
We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity ( Monick , M. M. , Carter , A. B. , Gudmundsson , G. , Geist , L. J. , and Hunninghake , G. W. ( 1998 ) Am. J. Physiol. 275 , L389-L397 ) .
To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity , we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex .
There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein , REF-1 ( which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins ) , in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
In addition , in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1 .
Finally , addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding .
These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity .
This observation may explain , in part , some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
Looking back at successes and failures in newer approaches to treating IBD , it is tempting -- although still difficult -- to draw conclusions about pathogenesis .
When a therapy proves effective , do clinicians truly know how it works ?
Even with a therapy as specific as anti-TNF antibody , it is not clear if the benefit is attributable to simple binding and clearance of TNF-alpha or to binding on the cell surface and subsequent deletion of the activated macrophage .
When a drug appears to be less effective than preclinical models suggest , can failures in effectiveness from delivery or dosing be differentiated ?
The disappointing results of clinical trials with IL-10 -- so at odds with the prediction of benefit from animal models -- bring into question the validity of those models as well as the soundness of design of the clinical trials on which efficacy of IL-10 is judged .
The variability of response even to the most narrowly targeted agents suggests that these diseases are far more heterogeneous in humans than in their murine counterparts .
Clinicians are only just beginning to recognize subclinical markers of response , and it may soon be possible to predict response on the basis of genetic composition .
For the moment , however , the field of pharmacogenetics is embryonic .
Challenges in developing new therapeutic strategies include not only identifying novel agents , but also improving the definitions of clinical endpoints and defining efficacy at the biologic level .
Only through considered evaluation of clinical evidence may clinicians determine which therapies should remain novelties and which should become an accepted part of the armamentarium .
In T lymphocytes , the hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) uses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) -induced signaling pathways to regulate E2F transcriptional activity , a critical cell cycle checkpoint .
PI 3-kinase also regulates the activity of p70(s6k) , the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase , a response that is abrogated by the macrolide rapamycin .
This immunosuppressive drug is known to prevent T-cell proliferation , but the precise point at which rapamycin regulates T-cell cycle progression has yet to be elucidated .
Moreover , the effects of rapamycin on , and the role of p70(s6k) in , IL-2 and PI 3-kinase activation of E2Fs have not been characterized .
Our present results show that IL-2- and PI 3-kinase-induced pathways for the regulation of E2F transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components .
Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70(s6k) in T cells could restore rapamycin-suppressed E2F responses .
Thus , the rapamycin-controlled processes involved in E2F regulation appear to be mediated by p70(s6k) .
However , the rapamycin-resistant p70(s6k) could not rescue rapamycin inhibition of T-cell cycle entry , consistent with the involvement of additional , rapamycin-sensitive pathways in the control of T-cell cycle progression .
The present results thus show that p70(s6k) is able to regulate E2F transcriptional activity and provide direct evidence for the first time for a link between IL-2 receptors , PI 3-kinase , and p70(s6k) that regulates a crucial G1 checkpoint in T lymphocytes .
Members of the recently discovered SOCS/CIS/SSI family have been proposed as regulators of cytokine signaling , and while targets and mechanisms have been suggested for some family members , the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined .
To date no SOCS proteins have been specifically implicated in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) signaling in T cells .
Here we report SOCS-3 expression in response to IL-2 in both T-cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
SOCS-3 protein was detectable as early as 30 min following IL-2 stimulation , while CIS was seen only at low levels after 2 h .
Unlike CIS , SOCS-3 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was observed upon coexpression with Jak1 and Jak2 but only weakly with Jak3 .
In these experiments , SOCS-3 associated with Jak1 and inhibited Jak1 phosphorylation , and this inhibition was markedly enhanced by the presence of IL-2 receptor beta chain ( IL-2Rbeta ) .
Moreover , following IL-2 stimulation of T cells , SOCS-3 was able to interact with the IL-2 receptor complex , and in particular tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 and IL-2Rbeta .
Additionally , in lymphocytes expressing SOCS-3 but not CIS , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b was markedly reduced , while there was only a weak effect on IL-3-mediated STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation .
Finally , proliferation induced by both IL-2- and IL-3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of SOCS-3 .
The findings suggest that when SOCS-3 is rapidly induced by IL-2 in T cells , it acts to inhibit IL-2 responses in a classical negative feedback loop .
Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and its receptor ( EPOR ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes .
After binding of ligand , the EPOR activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression .
Although erythroid progenitors appear to be the principal EPO-responsive cell type in vivo due to the restricted expression of the EPOR , many growth factor-dependent cell lines expressing the EPOR can respond to EPO by activating many or all of these pathways .
In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] -dependent HT-2 line ) in which the EPO stimulation of the EPOR fails to support cellular proliferation , STAT-5 induction , or MAPK activation , despite efficient phosphorylation of the EPOR and JAK2 and inhibition of apoptosis after withdrawal of IL-2 .
Interestingly , when we fused HT-2 cells expressing the EPOR with Ba/F3 cells in a complementation assay , the resulting hybridomas proliferated and potently activated STAT-5 and MAPK in response to EPO .
These data indicate that an unidentified cellular factor is needed to mediate signaling by the EPOR .
Moreover , Ba/F3 cells apparently express this factor ( s ) and somatic fusions can , therefore , confer EPO-responsiveness to HT-2 cells that lack this factor .
Recently NF-kappaB has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions .
In T cell hybridomas , both T cell activators and glucocorticoids induce apoptosis .
Here we show that blockade of NF-kappaB activity , using a dominant negative IkappaBalpha , has opposite effects on these two apoptotic signals .
Treatment with PMA plus ionomycin ( P/I ) results in the upregulation of Fas Ligand ( FasL ) and induction of apoptosis .
Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity inhibits the P/I mediated induction of FasL mRNA and decreases the level of apoptosis in these cultures , thus establishing NF-kappaB as a proapoptotic factor in this context .
Conversely , inhibition of NF-kappaB confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis , establishing that NF-kappaB also functions as an antiapoptotic factor .
We conclude that NF-kappaB is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator .
Our data suggests that NF-kappaB may function as an antiapoptotic factor in thymocytes while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in mature peripheral T cells .
Although erythropoietin ( Epo ) is essential for the production of mature red blood cells , the cooperation with other factors is required for a proper balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation .
In avian erythroid progenitors , steroid hormones cooperate with tyrosine kinase receptors to induce renewal of erythroid progenitors .
We examined the role of corticosteroids in the in vitro expansion of primary human erythroid cells in liquid cultures and colony assays .
Dexamethasone ( Dex ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone , cooperated with Epo and stem cell factor to induce erythroid progenitors to undergo 15 to 22 cell divisions , corresponding to a 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold amplification of erythroid cells .
Dex acted directly on erythroid progenitors and maintained the colony-forming capacity of the progenitor cells expanded in liquid cultures .
The hormone delayed terminal differentiation into erythrocytes , which was assayed by morphology , hemoglobin accumulation , and the expression of genes characteristic for immature cells .
Sustained proliferation of erythroid progenitors could be induced equally well from purified erythroid burst-forming units ( BFU-E ) , from CD34(+) blast cells , and from bone marrow depleted from CD34(+) cells .
T lymphocytes from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) show reduced immune function and impaired activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappaB .
We determined the mechanism of NF-kappaB suppression in T cells of RCC patient and determined whether supernatant fluid from RCC explants ( RCC-S ) induced the same phenotype of NF-kappaB suppression in normal T cells that is observed in patient T cells .
The pattern of kappaB-binding activity in T cells of RCC patient was altered as compared to that seen in T cells obtained from normal volunteers .
In some patients , no activation of RelA/NFkappaB1-binding activity was detectable , while in others kappaB-binding activity was modestly induced but the duration was reduced .
IkappaBalpha was degraded normally following stimulation in both normal controls and T cells from RCC patients .
RCC-S did not alter the cytoplasmic levels of RelA and NF-kappaB1 but did suppress their nuclear localization and inhibited the activation of RelA/NF-kappaB1 binding complexes .
These results show that RCC-S can induce in normal T cells the same phenotype of impaired NF-kappaB activation that is detected in T cells of RCC patient .
It also appears that NF-kappaB suppression by RCC-S may contribute to the immunosuppression of host immunity .
OBJECTIVE : To create monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies ( mAECA ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation .
METHODS : A panel of mAECA was generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with Takayasu arteritis , using Epstein-Barr virus transformation .
Activity against macrovascular EC ( HUVEC ) and microvascular EC ( human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 ) antigens was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Inhibition studies were used to select the monoclonal antibodies ( mAECA ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the total IgG-AECA from the Takayasu arteritis patient .
The binding of the mAECA to human aortic EC was studied by immunohistochemistry .
The secretion levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) were determined , to serve as markers for EC activation .
The activated EC were examined for the adherence of a monocytic cell line ( U937 ) , as well as for expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and E-selectin .
In addition , nuclear extracts of the mAECA-treated EC were analyzed for the induction of translocation of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , using a specific NF-kappaB oligoprobe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
RESULTS : Six mAECA were selected , the mixture of which produced 100 % inhibition of binding of the original IgG ( from the patient with Takayasu arteritis ) to HUVEC .
All mAECA possessed high activity against macrovascular EC , but none had significant antimicrovascular EC activity .
The mAECA , but not normal human IgG , had anti-human aortic EC activity .
Four of the 6 mAECA activated EC , manifested by increased IL-6 and vWF secretion .
The 4 mAECA induced EC expression of adhesion molecules and increased adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to EC .
In addition , these mAECA stimulated the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .
CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that AECA may directly stimulate EC in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of adhesion molecule expression associated with NF-kappaB activation and adhesion of monocytes , and may therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis .
We describe an enhancer site in the third intron of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
A reporter construct containing the 5'-flanking region of the mouse TNF-alpha gene displayed weak activity when transfected into RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells .
The addition of the third intron of TNF-alpha to this construct resulted in an enhancement of CAT protein .
This enhancement was eliminated if a conserved 20-bp sequence was removed from the intron or if a dominant-negative ets-binding factor was co-transfected with the reporter gene .
Mutations of this site that destroyed potential ets transcription factor binding sites had reduced transcriptional activity .
The major transcription factor that bound to the oligonucleotide was confirmed to be GABP by supershift and competition analysis .
In RAW264.7 cells , the binding was constitutive , however , in bone marrow-derived macrophages binding activity was shown to be interferon-gamma inducible .
This may imply a role for ets transcription factors in the production of TNF-alpha .
Different glucocorticoid hormones ( GCH ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity .
The mechanism ( s ) of action of GCH is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway .
We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DXM ) on the production of cytokines ( IL-2 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , IL-10 ) by peripheral T lymphocytes , and the effects on the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity by activated Jurkat cell line .
The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) not all the cytokines investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three GCH and ( b ) DXM inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN .
These data are in agreement with the concept that different GCH compounds might differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with transcription factor .
We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) to stimulate interleukin ( IL ) -8 production by neutrophils .
MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8 .
Incubation with 2 microM MBP showed that , after a 1 h lag , the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h .
At the 2 microM concentration , eosinophil cationic protein , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , and eosinophil peroxidase did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production .
MBP stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) after 1 and 3 h of incubation , which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D .
However , stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB or activator protein-1 .
No NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts .
In addition , stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA .
MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1alpha and MIP-1beta , but did not stimulate the release of either chemokine .
These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and , further , that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation .
We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases .
The peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors , plays a key role in the anti-diabetic actions of the thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) .
PPARgamma induces the expression of many genes involved in lipid anabolism , including the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein ( aP2 ) , and is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation .
PPARgamma is also expressed in hematopoietic cells and is up-regulated in activated monocytes/macrophages .
Activation of PPARgamma may play a role in the induction of differentiation of macrophages to foam cells that are associated with atherosclerotic lesions .
We report that both natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists induce time- and dose-dependent increases in aP2 mRNA in both primary human monocytes and the monocytic cell line , THP-1 .
These data suggest that PPARgamma activation may play a role in monocyte differentiation and function analogous to its well-characterized role in adipocytes .
The generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , a key signal of the innate immune system .
Yet , for many pathogens , the molecules that induce IL-12 production by macrophages and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined .
Here it is shown that microbial lipoproteins are potent stimulators of IL-12 production by human macrophages , and that induction is mediated by Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) .
Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent transcription of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide , a powerful microbicidal pathway .
Activation of TLRs by microbial lipoproteins may initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious pathogens .
The primary IL-13 receptor complex on human monocytes is believed to be a heterodimer comprised of the IL-4R alpha chain and the IL-2R gamma chain ( gamma(c) ) -like molecule , IL-13R alpha1 .
mRNA levels for IL-13R alpha1 , but not IL-4R alpha , were markedly decreased in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMac ) , and with increasing time of monocytes in culture correlated with the loss of IL-13 regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production .
Analysis of cell lines Daudi and THP-1 that differentially express gamma(c) and IL-13R alpha1 showed that IL-13 can activate STAT6 in IL-13R alpha1-positive THP-1 cells but not in gamma(c)-positive , IL-13R alpha1-negative Daudi cells .
IL-13 activation of STAT6 was reduced in MDMac which was associated with diminished IL-13-induced expression of CD23 and MHC class II .
However , with reduced IL-13R alpha1 expression and low nuclear STAT6 activity , some IL-13-induced responses were unaltered in magnitude in MDMac .
In the absence of functional IL-13R alpha1 and gamma(c) , IL-13 must signal through an alternative receptor complex on MDMac .
Experiments with a blocking antibody to IL-4R alpha showed that this chain remains an essential component of the IL-13 receptor complex on MDMac .
It is generally assumed that most mammalian genes are transcribed from both alleles .
Hence , the diploid state of the genome offers the advantage that a loss-of-function mutation in one allele can be compensated for by the remaining wild-type allele of the same gene .
Indeed , the vast majority of human disease syndromes and engineered mutations in the mouse genome are recessive , indicating that recessiveness is the ' default ' state .
However , a minority of genes are semi-dominant , as heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in these genes leads to phenotypic abnormalities .
This condition , known as haploinsufficiency , has been described for five of the nine mammalian Pax genes , which are associated with mouse developmental mutants and human disease syndromes .
Recently we have reported that the Pax5 gene is subject to allele-specific regulation during B cell development .
Pax5 is predominantly transcribed from only one of its two alleles in early B-lymphoid progenitors and mature B cells , while it transiently switches to a biallelic mode of transcription in pre-B and immature B cells .
As a consequence , B-lymphoid tissues are mosaic with regard to the transcribed allele , and heterozygous mutation of Pax5 therefore results in deletion of B lymphocytes expressing only the mutant allele .
The allele-specific regulation of Pax5 raises the intriguing possibility that monoallelic expression may also be the mechanism causing the haploinsufficiency of other Pax genes .
In this review , we discuss different models accounting for the haploinsufficiency of mammalian Pax genes , provide further evidence in support of the allele-specific regulation of Pax5 and discuss the implication of these findings in the context of the recent literature describing the stochastic and monoallelic activation of other hematopoietic genes .
Activation of CD40 is essential for thymus-dependent humoral immune responses and rescuing B cells from apoptosis .
Many of the effects of CD40 are believed to be achieved through altered gene expression .
In addition to Bcl-x , a known CD40-regulated antiapoptotic molecule , we identified a related antiapoptotic molecule , A1/Bfl-1 , as a CD40-inducible gene .
Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-kappaB abolished CD40-induced up-regulation of both the Bfl-1 and Bcl-x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas-induced cell death .
Within the upstream promoter region of Bcl-x , a potential NF-kappaB-binding sequence was found to support NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation .
Furthermore , expression of physiological levels of Bcl-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the absence of NF-kappaB signaling .
Thus , our results suggest that CD40-mediated cell survival proceeds through NF-kappaB-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 family members .
In Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated tumors in nonimmunocompromised patients , EBV gene expression is highly restricted .
EBV-encoded nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) -1 is expressed , whereas the immunogenic and proliferative EBNAs are not .
This pattern of EBNA expression is generated by usage of the BamHI-Q promoter ( Qp ) .
We have determined that the JAK/STAT pathway positively regulates Qp activity .
In transient-transfection assays , a Qp-CAT reporter was activated by cotransfected JAK-1 and by treatment of cells with the cytokine IL-6 .
The ability of Qp to bind signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins was directly demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay , and mutation of potential STAT-binding sites reduced Qp responsiveness to Janus kinase ( JAK ) -1 .
Consistent with a role for STATs in Qp function , Qp using Burkitt 's lymphoma Rael cells and cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cells contained nuclear STAT protein .
We investigated whether the inability to maintain EBV-positive NPC cell lines in culture was related to Qp activity .
Passaging of the NPC cell line HK666 led to activation of expression of BZLF1 , which encodes Zta and loss of Qp function .
Transient expression assays linked Zta expression to the down-regulation of Qp .
Cotransfection of Zta reduced Qp activity in reporter assays .
This negative regulation required Zta DNA-binding activity .
We provide evidence that Zta up-regulation of p53 leads to p53-mediated interference with JAK/STAT activation of Qp .
The data imply that JAK/STAT signaling has a role in EBV-associated malignancies .
The chimeric gene , AML1/ETO ( MTG8 ) , generated in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of Bcl-2 .
To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis , effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line , 32Dcl3 , were examined .
When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate , the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed .
However , even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2 .
On the contrary , 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF .
These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of AML1/ETO .
Tumor cell lines with a defective retinoblastoma gene are unable to transcribe the HLA class II genes in response to IFN-gamma treatment , and reconstitution of functional Rb rescues IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression .
However , the molecular mechanism of Rb rescue of the class II genes is unknown .
We have examined the effect of Rb expression on the activation of the promoter for HLA-DRA , the prototype class II gene .
Oct-1 , a POU domain transcription factor , was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells .
Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1 , thus relieving its repressive effect .
Oct-1 has also been shown to repress interleukin 8 promoter activity .
Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines , interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines .
This work aims at identifying the thymocyte subpopulation able to support human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication under the biological stimuli of the thymic microenvironment .
In this report we demonstrate that interaction with thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) induces a high-level replication of the T-tropic primary isolate HIV-1 ( B-LAIp ) exclusively in the mature CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(+) thymocytes .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) , secreted during this interaction , are critical cytokines for HIV long terminal repeat transactivation through NF-kappaB-dependent activation .
TNF is the major inducer of NF-kappaB and particularly of the p50-p65 complex , whereas IL-7 acts as a cofactor by sustaining the expression of the p75 TNF receptor .
The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(-) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates with the absence of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes .
Addition of exogenous TNF to the intermediate thymocyte cultures induces NF-kappaB activity and is sufficient to promote HIV replication in the cocultures with TEC .
The other major subpopulation expressing the CD4 receptor , namely , the double-positive ( DP ) CD4(+) CD8(+) CD3(+/-) thymocytes , despite the entry of the virus , do not produce a significant level of virus , presumably because they are unresponsive to TNF and IL-7 .
Together , these data suggest that in vivo , despite an efficient entry of the virus in all the CD4(+) subpopulations , a high viral load may be generated exclusively within the mature CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(+) subset of thymocytes .
However , under conditions of inflammatory response after infection , TNF might also be present in the intermediate thymocyte compartment , leading to efficient HIV replication in these cells .
Adenoviruses encode proteins that block responses to interferons , intrinsic cellular apoptosis , killing by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes and killing by the death ligands TNF , Fas ligand and TRAIL .
The viral proteins are believed to prolong acute and persistent adenovirus infections .
The proteins may prove useful in protecting adenovirus gene therapy vectors and transplanted cells from the immune system .
Immune induction is effected through the interaction of antigen-presenting cells with specific receptors on the surface of thymus-derived lymphocytes .
Cells most able to ingest , process , and present antigen appear to be related to the mononuclear phagocyte/neutrophil series .
For example dendritic cells ( DC ) can be found in colonies of GM-CSF-responsive bone marrow cells , and under experimental conditions are routinely expanded as a population in vitro from GM-CSF-responsive progenitor cells .
To address the question of DC lineage and to determine what genes are involved in lineage commitment , we have generated a series of GM-CSF-responsive cell lines that can be induced to differentiate in a homogeneous manner in vitro .
The cloned cell lines are derived from 12-day fetal liver and are transformed with a truncated form of c-myb , which lacks the normal autoregulatory sequences .
As far as we know , these myb-transformed hemopoi-etic cells ( MTHC ) differ from normal only in the unregulated expression of myb , a gene whose expression is obligatory for proliferation of hemopoietic cells .
MTHC in the presence of TNF-alpha and IL-4 will differentiate into cells that have many of the properties of macrophages .
When the same MTHC lines are exposed to TNF-alpha in combination with IFN-gamma , the cells instead become DC .
The differentiated DC are potent presenters of antigen in mixed lymphocyte reactions and of soluble antigen to specific T cell lines .
Thus , cells with the properties of both macrophages and DC can be derived from a single type of GM-CSF-responsive progenitor cell .
We have used this MTHC system to analyze differences in gene expression as the cells mature along the DC and macrophage pathways .
A distinctive pattern of differentially expressed cDNAs is evident where macrophage-specific cDNAs are homologous to genes encoding cytoskeletal and cell-surface proteins , whereas the DC-specific cDNAs are homologous to signaling , chemokine , and IFN-gamma-inducible genes .
We discuss the utility of MTHC in analyzing the relationships between DC and macrophages , and suggest that DC and macrophages represent extreme phenotypes in a spectrum of antigen handling cells that are somewhat interchangeable , depending on their immediate environment .
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which unknown arthrogenic autoantigen is presented to CD4+ T cells .
The strong association of the disease with an epitope within the HLA-DR chain shared between various alleles of HLA-DR4 and DR1 emphasizes the importance of antigen presentation .
This immune response predominantly occurs in the synovial tissue and fluid of the joints and autoreactive T cells are readily demonstrable in both the synovial compartment and blood .
Circulating dendritic cells ( DC ) are phenotypically and functionally identical with normal peripheral blood ( PB ) DC .
In the synovial tissue , fully differentiated perivascular DC are found in close association with T cells and with B cell follicles , sometimes containing follicular DC .
These perivascular DC migrate across the activated endothelium from blood and receive differentiative signals within the joint from monocyte-derived cytokines and CD40-ligand+ T cells .
In the SF , DC manifest an intermediate phenotype , similar to that of monocyte-derived DC in vitro .
Like a delayed-type hypersensitivity response , the rheumatoid synovium represents an effector site .
DC at many effector sites have a characteristic pattern of infiltration and differentiation .
It is important to note that the effector response is not self-limiting in RA autoimmune inflammation .
In this article , we argue that the presentation of self-antigen by DC and by autoantibody-producing B cells is critical for the perpetuation of the autoimmune response .
Permanently arresting this ongoing immune response with either pharmaceutical agents or immunotherapy is a major challenge for immunology .
AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( AIDS NHL ) comprises a diverse and heterogeneous group of high-grade B cell tumors .
Certain classes of AIDS NHL are associated with alterations in oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes or infections by oncogenic herpesviruses .
However , the clinically significant class of AIDS NHL designated immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid ( AIDS IBLP ) lacks any consistent genetic alterations .
We identified the TCL1 oncogene from a set of AIDS IBLP-associated cDNA fragments generated by subtractive hybridization with non-AIDS IBLP .
Aberrant TCL1 expression has been implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development , and its expression also has been seen in many established B cell tumor lines .
However , TCL1 expression has not been reported in AIDS NHL .
We find that TCL1 is expressed in the majority of AIDS IBLP tumors examined .
TCL1 protein expression is restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP tissue samples analyzed with immunohistochemical staining .
Hyperplastic lymph node and tonsil also exhibit strong TCL1 protein expression in mantle zone B cells and in rare interfollicular zone cells , whereas follicle-center B cells ( centroblasts and centrocytes ) show weaker expression .
These results establish TCL1 as the most prevalent of all of the surveyed oncogenes associated with AIDS IBLP .
They also indicate that abundant TCL1 expression in quiescent mantle zone B cells is down-regulated in activated germinal center follicular B cells in parallel to the known expression pattern of BCL-2 .
High-level expression in nonproliferating B cells suggests that TCL1 may function in protecting naive preactivated B cells from apoptosis .
AML1 plays a critical role during hematopoiesis and chromosomal translocations involving AML1 are commonly associated with different forms of leukemia , including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation , we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene , blk .
Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity .
Furthermore , in vitro binding analysis revealed that the AML1 runt DNA-binding domain physically interacts with the paired DNA-binding domain of BSAP , a B cell-specific transcription factor .
BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene .
Physical interaction of AML1 with BSAP correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate blk promoter transcription by more than 50-fold .
These results demonstrate physical and functional interactions between AML1 and BSAP and suggest that AML1 is an important factor for regulating a critical B cell-specific gene , blk .
Mutations inactivating the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 may be responsible for disease for up to 80 % of familial ovarian cancer cases .
In this syndrome , tumorigenesis classically initiates from an inherited mutation in one allele followed by somatic deletion of the normal allele .
Sequencing of BRCA1 amplified from genomic DNA of lymphocytes and microdissected ovarian tumor cells of a familial ovarian cancer patient revealed three , rare heterozygous DNA variations ( 2418delA , 233G --> A , and IVS1-10T --> C ) in both tumor and constitutional ( lymphocyte ) DNA .
Thus , both copies of BRCA1 were retained in tumor .
Haplotype analysis of the patient and four siblings assigned 2418delA to one copy of BRCA1 and 233G --> A and IVS1-10T --> C to the other .
The DNA change , 2418delA , is considered a mutation that inactivated one BRCA1 allele because it caused a frameshift and generation of a premature stop codon , resulting in synthesis of a truncated peptide as evidenced by an in vitro protein truncation test .
The DNA variation , 233G --> A , does not result in an amino acid change , and is considered a benign polymorphism .
IVS1-10T --> C is a unique BRCA1 change that occurs in the last nucleotide of a consensus sequence for a branch site critical for RNA splicing .
Therefore , we investigated whether IVS1-10T --> C deleteriously affected BRCA1 splicing or expression , and thereby inactivated the other BRCA1 allele .
Using the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with RNA isolated from lymphoid cell lines of the patient and of controls , no evidence was found that IVS1-10TC abnormally disrupted mRNA splicing or caused the absence of BRCA1 mRNA .
Thus , IVS1-10T --> C is not harmful to BRCA1 function , and is classified a benign polymorphism .
Retention of the normal BRCA1 allele in the tumor with the heterozygous germline BRCA1 mutation , 2418delA , indicated that mutational inactivation of both BRCA1 alleles was not required for tumorigenesis .
It is possible that the normal allele may be functionally inactivated by a nonmutational mechanism .
E1A oncogene expression increases mammalian cell susceptibility to lysis by cytolytic lymphocytes ( CLs ) at a stage in this intercellular interaction that is independent of cell surface recognition events .
Since CLs can induce either apoptotic or necrotic cell death , we asked whether E1A sensitization to injury-induced apoptosis is sufficient to explain E1A-induced cytolytic susceptibility .
Mouse , rat , hamster , and human cells that were rendered cytolytic susceptible by E1A were also sensitized to CL-induced and chemically induced apoptosis .
In contrast , E1A-positive cells were no more susceptible to injury-induced necrosis than E1A-negative cells .
Similar to induction of cytolytic susceptibility and in contrast to other E1A activities , cellular sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis depended on high-level E1A oncoprotein expression .
Loss of both cytolytic susceptibility and sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis was coselected during in vivo selection of E1A-positive sarcoma cells for increased tumorigenicity .
Furthermore , E1A mutant proteins that can not bind the cellular transcriptional coactivator , p300 , and that fail to induce cytolytic susceptibility also failed to sensitize cells to injury-induced apoptosis .
These data indicate that E1A induces susceptibility to killer cell-induced lysis through sensitization of cells to injury-induced apoptosis .

Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) is a pluripotent activator of inflammation by inducing a proinflammatory cytokine cascade .
This phenomenon is mediated , in part , through inducible expression of the CXC chemokine , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) .
In this study , we investigate the role of TNFalpha-inducible reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in IL-8 expression by " monocyte-like " U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells .
TNFalpha is a rapid activator of IL-8 gene expression by U937 , producing a 50-fold induction of mRNA within 1 hour of treatment .
In gene transfection assays , the effect of TNFalpha requires the presence of an inducible nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) ( Rel A ) binding site in the IL-8 promoter .
TNFalpha treatment induces a rapid translocation of the 65 kD transcriptional activator NF-kappaB subunit , Rel A , whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in intracellular ROS .
Pretreatment ( or up to 15 minutes posttreatment ) relative to TNFalpha with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( 2 % [ vol/vol ] ) blocks 80 % of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription .
Surprisingly , however , DMSO has no effect on inducible Rel A binding .
Similar selective effects on NF-kappaB transcription are seen with the unrelated antioxidants , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) and vitamin C .
These data indicate that TNFalpha induces a delayed ROS-dependent signalling pathway that is required for NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation .
Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by TNFalpha signalling .
An early event in acute and chronic inflammation and associated diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis is the induced expression of specific adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells ( ECs ) , which subsequently bind leukocytes .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) , members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors , are activated by fatty acid metabolites , peroxisome proliferators , and thiazolidinediones and are now recognized as important mediators in the inflammatory response .
Whether PPAR activators influence the inflammatory responses of ECs is unknown .
We show that the PPAR activators 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -prostaglandin J ( 2 ) ( 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) ) , Wyeth 14643 , ciglitazone , and troglitazone , but not BRL 49653 , partially inhibit the induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , as measured by ELISA , and monocyte binding to human aortic endothelial cells ( HAECs ) activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide .
The " natural " PPAR activator 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) had the greatest potency and was the only tested molecule capable of partially inhibiting the induced expression of E-selectin and neutrophil-like HL60 cell binding to PMA-activated HAECs .
Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 induction by PMA was unaffected by any of the molecules tested .
Both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma mRNAs were detected in HAECs by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a ribonuclease protection assay ; however , we have yet to determine which , if any , of the PPARs are mediating this process .
These results suggest that certain PPAR activators may help limit chronic inflammation mediated by VCAM-1 and monocytes without affecting acute inflammation mediated by E-selectin and neutrophil binding .
Monocyte migration and activation are regulated by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) .
Prior studies have shown MCP-1 expression is modulated by a variety of ligands that act through extracellular receptors .
In the current study , we show 9-cis retinoic acid ( RA ) , a ligand for the nuclear hormone receptor retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , markedly induces the expression of MCP-1 .
In human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells cultured with RA ( 0.05 to 500 nmol/L ) , MCP-1 expression was induced rapidly , significantly , and dose-dependently by as much as 165-fold .
MCP-1 RNA level was also increased in RA-treated cells .
Expression of PPARgamma , a heterodimer partner of RXR , is also markedly induced by RA in THP-1 cells .
However , BRL49653 , a PPARgamma ligand , failed to induce MCP-1 secretion either alone or to modify the expression level induced by RA .
In contrast , BRL49653 significantly increased MCP-1 ( biotinylated MCP-1 ) binding to THP-1 cells , whereas RA had no effect .
Other peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( PPAR ) ligands , 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and troglitazone ( PPARgamma ) , Wy14 , 643 ( PPARalpha ) , and PD195599 ( PPARbeta ) inhibited the induction of MCP-1 by RA .
RA 's effect on MCP-1 expression in human elutriated monocytes were similar to that observed in the THP-1 cells .
These studies identify RA as a nuclear signal for MCP-1 induction in undifferentiated human monocytic cells .
These studies also suggest monocyte MCP-1 expression induced through RA may modulate cell migration .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax is thought to play a pivotal role in immortalization of T cells .
We have recently shown that the expression of Tax protected the mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 against apoptosis induced by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) deprivation and converted its growth from being IL-2 dependent to being IL-2 independent .
In this study , we demonstrate that constitutive expression of bcl-xl but not bcl-2 , bcl-xs , bak , bad , or bax was associated with apoptosis resistance after IL-2 deprivation in CTLL-2 cells that expressed Tax .
Transient-transfection assays showed that bcl-x promoter was transactivated by wild-type Tax .
Similar effects were observed in mutant Tax retaining transactivating ability through NF-kappaB .
Deletion or substitution of a putative NF-kappaB binding site identified in the bcl-x promoter significantly decreased Tax-induced transactivation .
This NF-kappaB-like element was able to form a complex with NF-kappaB family proteins in vitro .
Furthermore , Tax-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IkappaBalpha , which specifically inhibits NF-kappaB activity .
Our findings suggest that constitutive expression of Bcl-x ( L ) induced by Tax through the NF-kappaB pathway contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis in CTLL-2 cells after IL-2 deprivation .
Side-chain modified vitamin D analogs including 20-Epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-trihomo-1alpha,2 5-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( KH1060 ) , and 1,24-dihydroxy-22-ene-24-cyclopropyl-vitamin D3 ( MC903 ) were originally designed to aid in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders including psoriasis and cancer .
Here we demonstrate that these analogs , as well as the 6-cis-locked conformer , 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-lumisterol3 ( JN ) prime NB4 cells for monocytic differentiation .
Previously , the action of MC903 and KH1060 was presumed to be mediated by the nuclear vitamin D receptor ( VDRnuc ) .
Differentiation in response to all analogs was shown to be inhibited by 1beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( HL ) , the antagonist to the nongenomic activities of 1,25D3 .
These data suggest that although MC903 and KH1060 may bind the VDRnuc , that the differentiative activities of these agents requires nongenomic signaling pathways .
Here we show that 1alpha,25(OH)2-d5-previtamin D3 ( HF ) , JN , KH1060 , and MC903 induce expression of PKC alpha and PKC delta and translocation of both isoforms to the particulate fraction , and PKC alpha to the nuclear fraction .
The full differentiation response with combinations of analogs and TPA was inhibited 50 % by the membrane permeable Ca2+ chelator , 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid ( BAPTA-AM ) or calpain inhibitor I .
These data demonstrate that intracellular free calcium and the calcium-dependent protease , calpain play critical roles in monocytic differentiation .
Intracellular calcium appears to be most critical in the 1,25D3-priming stage of differentiation , while calpain is essential in the TPA maturation response .
Primary ( partial ) cortisol receptor resistance was previously reported in a total of 7 patients and 14 asymptomatic family members .
Its occurrence is considered to be extremely rare .
In the present study we report on 6 patients ( 2 males and 4 females ) with the syndrome .
The first male patient presented with mild hypertension .
Hydrochlorothiazide therapy resulted in life-threatening hypokalemia .
The second male patient had slight hypertension without hypokalemia .
All four female patients presented between the age of 20-30 yr with acne , hirsutism , and irregular menstruations .
Low dose dexamethasone therapy ( 1-1.5 mg/day ) was of clinical benefit in these patients .
All patients showed insufficient suppression of serum cortisol concentrations in the overnight 1-mg dexamethasone test .
The diurnal rhythm of ACTH and cortisol was intact , albeit at an elevated level .
There was a normal increase in ACTH , cortisol , and GH ( except in one obese patient ) in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia , while cortisol production was elevated in three patients .
Circulating adrenal androgen levels were increased in all patients .
Glucocorticoid receptors were investigated in a whole cell dexamethasone binding assay in mononuclear leukocytes .
In the first male patient , the number of receptors was very low , while the affinity was lower than that in controls .
A lowered affinity to dexamethasone was found in one female patient , while a lowered number of receptors was found in three patients .
In the second male patient , no abnormalities were found .
As a bioassay for glucocorticoid action we also measured dexamethasone suppressibility of mitogen-stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine in mononuclear leukocytes .
In the male patient with normal receptor status , dexamethasone suppressibility of [3H]thymidine incorporation was significantly lower than that in healthy controls with respect to both maximal suppression and IC50 .
Partial cortisol receptor resistance might be less rare than previously thought .
In the six patients presented , at least three different forms can be recognized .
Therapy with dexamethasone was successful in female patients with acne and hirsutism , as the secondary increase in the production of adrenal androgens was effectively controlled .
Analogs of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 ) with substitutions on C-11 were synthesized .
Small apolar substitutions ( 11 alpha-methyl , 11 alpha-fluoromethyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin D receptor , but larger ( 11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl ) or more polar substitutions ( 11 alpha-hydroxymethyl , 11 alpha-(2-hydroxyethyl ] decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 alpha,25-OH)2D3 .
Their affinity for the vitamin D-binding protein , however , increased up to 4-fold .
The biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 .
The 11 beta-methyl analog had a greater than 10-fold lower activity .
The differentiating effects of the other C-11 analogs on human promyeloid leukemia cells ( HL-60 ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo .
Large or polar substitutions on C-11 of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 thus impair the binding of the vitamin D receptor but increase the affinity to vitamin D-binding protein .
The effects of many C-11-substituted 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 analogs on HL-60 cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism .
High affinity receptors ( VDR ) for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( calcitriol ) are expressed in HL60 human leukemia cells and in low numbers in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) .
HL60 cells , expressing some characteristics of promyelocytes , can be induced to monocytoid differentiation by calcitriol .
Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was examined after exposure of whole cells to 10(-9) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei .
Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was found to be time dependent reaching a maximum of approximately 2100 binding sites/nucleus after 3 h of incubation in HL60 cells , whereas a maximum of approximately 310 binding sites/nucleus was found after 3 h in PBL .
Pulse exposure of HL60 to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately 1600 radiolabeled VDR by 8 h and approximately 1000 VDR by 24 h .
Radiolabeled VDR disappeared from the nuclear compartment with a halflife of approximately 30 min if cells were cultured with identical concentrations of unlabeled hormone after the pulse ( pulse/chase-experiments ) .
No difference of VDR retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in PBL , where VDR halflife was approximately 30 min .
No specific translocation into the nuclear compartment was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [3H]calcitriol .
Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone -- in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells -- did not disappear from the nuclear compartment upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound .
The activity of DNA relaxing enzymes ( e.g. topoisomerases I and II ) in nuclear extracts was measured using a PBR 322-relaxation-assay .
Enhanced overall enzyme activity was found in nuclear extracts by 1 h after incubation with calcitriol ( final ethanol concentration 0.0001 % v/v ) in HL60 and PBL .
The enhanced activity disappeared after 2 h in PBL , whereas it was still enhanced by 4 h in HL60 .
No effect was seen in ethanol treated controls .
We conclude that a specific nuclear translocation mechanism exists for calcitriol in both cell types examined , most likely due to translocation of receptor proteins after hormone binding .
Translocated hormone/receptor complexes compete for a limited number of specific nuclear binding sites .
Enhanced activity of topoisomerases in nuclear extracts upon translocation of VDR might reflect interaction of both within the nuclear compartment , thus initiating DNA-unwinding , a prerequisite of transcription initiation .
Binding of type I interferon ( IFN-alpha/beta ) to specific receptors results in the rapid transcriptional activation , independent of protein synthesis , of IFN-alpha-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) in human fibroblasts and HeLa and Daudi cell lines .
The binding of ISGF3 ( IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 ) to the conserved IFN-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) results in transcriptional activation .
This factor is composed of a DNA-binding protein ( ISGF3 gamma ) , which normally is present in the cytoplasm , and other IFN-alpha-activated proteins which preexist as latent cytoplasmic precursors ( ISGF3 alpha ) .
We have found that ISG expression in the monocytic U937 cell line differs from most cell lines previously examined .
U937 cells express both type I and type II IFN receptors , but only IFN-alpha is capable of inducing antiviral protection in these cells .
Pretreatment with IFN-gamma potentiates the IFN-alpha-induced protection , but IFN-gamma alone does not have any antiviral activity .
ISG15 mRNA accumulation in U937 cells is not detectable before 6 h of IFN-alpha treatment , peaks at 24 h , and requires protein synthesis .
Although IFN-gamma alone does not induce ISG expression , IFN-gamma pretreatment markedly increases and hastens ISG expression and transcriptional induction .
Nuclear extracts assayed for the presence of ISRE binding factors by electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that ISGF3 is induced by IFN-alpha within 6 h from undetectable basal levels in untreated U937 cells .
Activation of ISGF3 alpha , the latent component of ISGF3 , occurs rapidly .
However , the increase in ISGF3 activity ultimately correlates with the accumulation of ISGF3 gamma induced by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma .

We have earlier found that in Jurkat cells activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) enhances the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation induced by adenosine receptor stimulation or activation of Gs .
Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) which stimulates PKC and a combination of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA ( 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido adenosine ) and forskolin to raise cAMP , on the levels of c-Fos and Jun and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the transcription factor , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .
PMA treatment caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in both c-Fos and Jun immunoreactivity in contrast to cAMP elevation that had only a slight effect .
Both PMA and the combination of NECA and forskolin acted together either to increase ( c-Fos ) or decrease ( Jun ) protein levels as well as increasing AP-1 binding , as judged by gel-shift assay , and AP-1 transcriptional activity .
Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the PKC stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents .
The results demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of PKC and elevation of cAMP leads to an enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in a T-leukemia cell line , suggesting that the previously observed interaction between the parallel signal transduction pathways may have functional consequences at the level of gene transcription .
Activation of T lymphocytes induces transcription of genes encoding for lymphokines .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene expression is controlled transcriptionally by the cooperative activity of specific trans-activating factors that bind to the IL-2 enhancer .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 inhibit the production of IL-2 in T lymphocytes at the level of gene transcription .
A member of the src gene family , the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase , p56lck , has been implicated in IL-2 production .
CsA was found not to inhibit lck gene expression , nor the activity of the lck gene product .
However , CsA and FK506 inhibit the appearance of DNA binding activity of factors that bind to the NF-AT and AP-1 sites in the IL-2 enhancer .
Since the induction of NF-AT and AP-1 is induced by the same stimuli that stimulate IL-2 production , these results indicate that the immunosuppressant action of CsA and FK506 is exerted at the level of these trans-activating factors .
The work reviewed in this article separates T cell development into four phases .
First is an expansion phase prior to TCR rearrangement , which appears to be correlated with programming of at least some response genes for inducibility .
This phase can occur to some extent outside of the thymus .
However , the profound T cell deficit of nude mice indicates that the thymus is by far the most potent site for inducing the expansion per se , even if other sites can induce some response acquisition .
Second is a controlled phase of TCR gene rearrangement .
The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular loci for rearrangement are still not known .
It seems that the rearrangement of the TCR gamma loci in the gamma delta lineage may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of TCR beta in the alpha beta lineage , and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge .
In the TCR alpha beta lineage , however , the final gene rearrangement events are accompanied by rapid proliferation and an interruption in cellular response gene inducibility .
The loss of conventional responsiveness is probably caused by alterations at the level of signaling , and may be a manifestation of the physiological state that is a precondition for selection .
Third is the complex process of selection .
Whereas peripheral T cells can undergo forms of positive selection ( by antigen-driven clonal expansion ) and negative selection ( by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death ) , neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex .
Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness : instead of turning on IL-2 expression , the activated cell destroys its own chromatin .
The genes that need to be induced for this response are not yet identified , but it is unquestionably a form of activation .
It is interesting that in humans and rats , cortical thymocytes undergoing negative selection can still induce IL-2R alpha expression and even be rescued in vitro , if exogenous IL-2 is provided .
Perhaps murine thymocytes are denied this form of rescue because they shut off IL-2R beta chain expression at an earlier stage or because they may be uncommonly Bcl-2 deficient ( cf. Sentman et al. , 1991 ; Strasser et al. , 1991 ) .
Even so , medullary thymocytes remain at least partially susceptible to negative selection even as they continue to mature .
1 . This study was designed to investigate the presence of estrogen type I ( high affinity , low capacity ) and type II ( low affinity , high capacity ) binding sites in human peripheral blood monocytes and the effects of danazol on these sites .
2 . These two types of estrogen binding sites existed in human peripheral blood monocytes .
3 . Danazol bound to these sites in high concentration ( 10(-6) M , clinical serum concentration during danazol therapy ) and decreased the number of both sites .
4 . It is suggested that danazol has an anti-estrogenic action to the monocytes through the competition and suppression of estrogen binding sites as seen in the estrogen target organ .
The steroid hormone are very versatile molecules : although they are related among them by their chemical structure , they have very diverse functions and including antagonic .
Their action mechanism is not completely cleared .
The estrogens participate in the regulation of practically all the reproductive and sexual events of the female , although the intracellular actions by which they take place are not well known and the proposed models do not adequately satisfy the questions .
Currently it is accepted the existence of a cytoplasmic and/or nuclear receptor , without explaining satisfactorily how the hormones come to the nucleus .
The endocrine events that are rapidly expressed ( seconds ) are due to a possible interaction with cellular membrane .
The purpose of this review is to analyze and concilliate the reported data on the mechanism of action of estrogens .
We investigated the clinical significance of glucocorticoid receptor determination in 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) who afterwards developed nephrotic syndrome .
Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) in these patients were comparable with those in both other patients with SLE and healthy persons .
Improvement in urinary protein excretion and in disease activity , which was scored according to the SLE Disease Activity Index system of the University of Toronto , closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in MNL isolated from the corresponding patients .
In summary , glucocorticoid receptor determination in patients with lupus nephritis may be a predictive clue for assessing responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy .
A major difficulty in determination of glucocorticoid receptor sites is the very complicated assay procedure .
Therefore , we describe a microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [3H]-dexamethasone as radioligand .
This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably .
Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple blood samples in parallel , we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test if glucocorticoid receptor binding is altered in this ' stressful ' disease .
On the first day of the disease , glucocorticoid receptor capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity , whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again .
This result fits well into the general observation of stress-induced down-regulation of immune responses .
The present work has examined the effects of okadaic acid , an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases , on the regulation of c-jun expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 leukemia cells .
The results demonstrate that okadaic acid treatment is associated with induction of a differentiated monocyte phenotype characterized by : ( a ) growth arrest ; ( b ) increases in Mac-1 cell surface antigen expression ; ( c ) down-regulation of c-myc transcripts ; and ( d ) induction of tumor necrosis factor gene expression .
This induction of monocytic differentiation was associated with transient increases in c-jun mRNA levels , which were maximal at 6 h .
Similar effects were obtained for the c-fos gene .
Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun transcription in U-937 cells and that this rate is increased approximately 40-fold following okadaic acid exposure .
c-jun mRNA levels were superinduced in cells treated with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide , whereas inhibition of protein synthesis had little , if any , effect on okadaic acid-induced c-jun transcription .
The half-life of c-jun mRNA was similar ( 45-50 min ) in both untreated and okadaic acid-induced cells .
In contrast , treatment with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide was associated with stabilization ( t 1/2 = 90 min ) of c-jun transcripts .
Taken together , these findings indicate that the induction of c-jun transcription by okadaic acid is controlled primarily by a transcriptional mechanism .
Since previous studies have demonstrated that the c-jun gene is autoinduced by Jun/AP-1 , we also studied transcription of c-jun promoter ( positions -132/+170 ) -reporter gene constructs with and without a mutated AP-1 element .

We report here that interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain ( p55 ) .
Similarly , IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937 , but not in resting human T-cells .
This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2 .
Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence ( -291 to -245 ) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated .
In addition , IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor , whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged .
We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in T lymphocytes and monocytes and mediated through translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells .
We used phenolic , lipid-soluble , chain-breaking antioxidants ( butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , nordihydroquairetic acid , or alpha-tocopherol ( vitamin E ) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells blocks the functions depending on NF-kappa B activation .
BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced , but also constitutive , HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T ( J.Jhan ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines .
This was also true for KBF ( p50 homodimer ) binding activity in U937 cells .
Secretion of TNF , the product of another NF-kappa B-dependent gene , was abolished by BHA in PMA-stimulated U937 cells .
The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol , but not glutathione , content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell , whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level .
Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation .
These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status .
Rather , TNF and PMA can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status , because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation .
It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of NF-kappa B-dependent genes .
Rapid nongenomic in vitro effects of aldosterone on intracellular electrolytes , cell volume , and Na(+)-H+ antiport have been found in human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) .
Binding of 125I-labeled aldosterone to plasma membranes of HML shares important features with these functional data .
This includes a very low apparent dissociation constant ( Kd ) of 0.1 nM for both aldosterone and the effect on the Na(+)-H(+)-antiport , a high turnover rate , and the almost exclusive binding selectivity for aldosterone .
Dexamethasone , RU 26988 , corticosterone , ouabain , amiloride , and 18-hydroxyprogesterone were inactive as ligands .
Deoxycorticosterone acetate had an intermediate activity with an apparent Kd of 100 nM .
These findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding of aldosterone being compatible with major aspects of its nongenomic effects .
Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals .
Two classes of LTR size variants were found .
One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 .
Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer .
This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence ( CTG-motif ) .
Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites .
No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected .
In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately , equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells .
The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days .
Based on these results we estimate a 5-10 % difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type .
NF kappa B is a potent mediator of specific gene expression in human monocytes and has been shown to play a role in transcription of the HIV-1 genome in promonocytic leukemias .
There is little information available on the response of NF kappa B to cytokines in normal human monocytes .
We have used a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat , which contains a tandem repeat of the NF kappa B binding sequence , as a probe in a gel retardation assay to study this transcription factor .
Using this assay , we have detected NF kappa B in extracts of nuclei from normal human monocytes .
Treatment of normal monocytes with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) for 4-24 h caused the complete disappearance of NF kappa B from nuclear extracts of monocytes .
A similar result was obtained with the mature monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 .
The constitutive transcription factor SP1 was unaffected by addition of TPA .
The disappearance of NF kappa B from the nucleus was concentration dependent between 10 and 50 ng/ml of phorbol ester .
In THP-1 cells , TPA also induced a new , faster-migrating NF kappa B species not induced in monocytes .
Protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine , but not cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor HA-1004 , also dramatically reduced constitutive levels of nuclear NF kappa B .
Finally , TPA addition to monocytes infected with HIV-1 inhibited HIV-1 replication , as determined by reverse transcriptase assays , in a concentration-dependent manner .
These results are in striking contrast to the increase in nuclear NF kappa B and HIV-1 replication induced by phorbol esters in promonocytic leukemia cells U937 and HL-60 , and emphasize the importance of studying cytokine regulation of HIV-1 in normal monocytes .
The chemiluminescent ( CL ) response of interferon-gamma-treated U937 ( IFN-U937 ) cells to sensitized target cells has been used to detect red cell , platelet and granulocyte antibodies .
A clone of U937 cells was selected which expressed Fc receptor I ( Fc gamma RI ) and which , after incubation with IFN-gamma for 72 h , was capable of generating high levels of lucigenin-enhanced CL .
The CL responses of IFN-U937 cells and peripheral blood human monocytes to sensitized red cells , platelets or granulocytes were then compared .
Assays using monocytes or IFN-U937 cells were of comparable sensitivity for detection of antibodies against all three types of target cell .
In addition , the use of IFN-U937 cells reduced interassay variation and simplified assay performance .
The potential clinical usefulness of these CL assays was suggested by the ability of both monocytes and IFN-U937 cells to respond to red cells , platelets or granulocytes sensitized with sera from pregnant women whose babies had either haemolytic disease of the newborn ( HDN ) , alloimmune thrombocytopenia or alloimmune neutropenia respectively .
In addition , monocytes and IFN-U937 cells both responded to red cells sensitized with antibodies against a variety of specificities of assumed ( although not documented ) clinical significance for blood transfusion recipients .
In contrast , monocytes and IFN-U937 cells responded only weakly to red cells sensitized with either anti-D in sera from mothers of babies unaffected by HDN , or with antisera containing high titre antibodies with specificities not normally associated with significantly reduced red cell survival .
Activation of T cells is initiated by the recognition of antigen on antigen presenting cells to exert the effector functions in immune and inflammatory responses .
Two types of helper T cell ( Th ) clones ( Th1 and Th2 ) are defined on the basis of different patterns of cytokine ( lymphokine ) secretion .
They determine the outcome of an antigenic response toward humoral or cell-mediated immunity .
Although lymphokine genes are coordinately regulated upon antigen stimulation , they are regulated by the mechanisms common to all as well as those which are unique to each gene .
For most lymphokine genes , a combination of phorbol esters ( phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate , PMA ) and calcium ionophores ( A23187 ) is required for their maximal induction .
Yet phorbol ester alone or calcium ionophore alone produce several lymphokines .
The production of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is completely dependent on the two signals .
We have previously found a cis-acting region spanning the GM-CSF promoter region ( positions -95 to +27 ) that confers inducibility to reporter genes in transient transfection assays .
Further analysis identified three elements required for efficient induction , referred to as GM2 , GC-box and conserved lymphokine element ( CLE0 ) .
GM2 defines a binding site for protein ( s ) whose binding is inducible by PMA .
One protein , NF-GM2 is similar to the transcription factor NF-kB .
GC-box is a binding site for constitutively bound proteins .
CLEO defines a binding site for protein ( s ) whose optimum binding is stimulated by PMA and A23187 .
Viral trans-activators such as Tax ( human T cell leukemia virus-1 , HTLV-1 ) and E2 ( bovine papilloma virus , BPV ) proteins are other agents which activate lymphokine gene expression by bypassing T cell receptor ( TCR ) mediated signaling .
The trans-activation domain of E2 and Tax is interchangeable although they have no obvious sequence homology between them .
The viral trans-activators appear to target specific DNA binding protein such as NF-kB and Sp1 to cis-acting DNA site and promote lymphokine gene expression without TCR-mediated stimulation .
We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells .
Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation .
Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction was tested .
PMA , which directly activates PKC , mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun , but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect .
The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7 , a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC , and less efficiently by H-8 , a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC , but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases .
Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence , TRE , and AP-1 enhancer activity , in Jurkat cells .
PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity , whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects .
We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC .
Treatment of human B lymphocytes with an optimal concentration of okadaic acid , an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A , resulted in the induction of the transcription factor , AP-1 and a marked increase in NF-kappa B levels .
In contrast , no effect on the levels of the octamer binding proteins , Oct-1 or Oct-2 , were found .
Since both AP-1 and NF-kappa B have been reported to be important in the induction of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene we examined the effects of okadaic acid on TNF-alpha mRNA levels .
Treatment with okadaic acid resulted in a striking increase in TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts within 1 h of stimulation and large amounts of TNF-alpha were released into the culture media .
Although okadaic acid provides a potent inductive signal for AP-1 and NF-kappa B it did not induce either B cell proliferation or immunoglobulin secretion .
The nuclear factor NF-AT ( ref. 1 ) is induced in T cells stimulated through the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex , and is required for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene induction .
Although NF-AT has not been cloned or purified , there is evidence that it is a major target for immunosuppression by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( refs 2-7 ) .
NF-AT induction may require two activation-dependent events : the CsA-sensitive translocation of a pre-existing component and the CsA-resistant synthesis of a nuclear component .
Here we report that the newly synthesized nuclear component of NF-AT is the transcription factor AP-1 .
We show that the inducible nuclear form of NF-AT contains Fos and Jun proteins .
Furthermore , we identify a pre-existing NF-AT-binding factor that is present in hypotonic extracts of unstimulated T cells .
On the basis of binding , reconstitution and cotransfection experiments , we propose that activation of NF-AT occurs in at least two stages : a CsA-sensitive stage involving modification and/or translocation of the pre-existing NF-AT complex , and a CsA-insensitive stage involving the addition of newly synthesized Fos or Fos/Jun proteins to the pre-existing complex .
The function of a putative NFAT-1 site in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer has been analyzed .
Activation by the T-cell antigen receptor is minimal in Jurkat cells and is mediated by the kappa B sites .
The putative NFAT-1 region is not required for the response to anti-CD3 or to mitogens in T-cell , B-cell , or monocyte/macrophage leukemia lines , nor is it a cis-acting negative regulatory element .
The role of the protooncogene c-fos in interleukin ( IL ) 6-induced B cell differentiation was assessed .
Treatment of SKW 6.4 cells with IL 6 induced a transient and early stimulation of c-fos sense mRNA expression .
The effect appeared within 30 min and returned to basal levels after 2 h .
The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to c-fos significantly inhibited IL 6-induced IgM production by SKW 6.4 cells ( p less than 0.001 ) , whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect .
These results indicate that activation of c-fos is involved in IL 6-induced differentiation of SKW 6.4 cells into IgM-secreting cells .
The induction of the AP-1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T cell differentiation and activation .
We have studied the regulation of AP-1 activity in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes stimulated through the activation inducer molecule ( AIM ) /CD69 activation pathway .
Phorbol esters are required to induce AIM/CD69 cell-surface expression as well as for triggering the proliferation of T cells in conjunction with anti-AIM mAb .
Mobility shift assays showed that addition of anti-AIM mAb to PMA-treated T lymphocytes markedly enhanced the binding activity of AP-1 to its cognate sequence , the phorbol ester response element .
In contrast , anti-AIM mAb did not induce any change in the binding activity of NF-kappa B , a transcription factor whose activity is also regulated by protein kinase C .
The increase in AP-1-binding activity was accompanied by the marked stimulation of the transcription of c-fos but not that of c-jun .
Blockade of the DNA-binding complexes with an anti-Fos mAb demonstrated a direct participation of c-Fos in the AP-1 complexes induced by anti-AIM mAb .
Most of the AP-1 activity could be eliminated when the anti-AIM mAb was added to the culture medium in the presence of cycloheximide , suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is crucial for the induction of AP-1-binding activity .
These data provide the evidence that activation of human peripheral blood T cells through the AIM activation pathway regulate the activity of AP-1 .
Therefore , this pathway appears as a crucial step in the initiation of early T cell activation events .
1 . In order to further understand the apparent glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder , circadian variation in cortisol concentration , dexamethasone suppression and glucocorticoid receptor binding in mononuclear leukocytes , polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts were measured in rigidly defined major depressive disorder patients and non-depressed psychiatric controls .
2 . Mononuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid , but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects .
3 . Initial and post-dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects .
4 . The phenomenon of glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder remains unexplained .
c-myc protooncogene is implicated in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoid malignancies and high levels of c-myc mRNA expression are observed in activated blood mononuclear cells .
Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) is characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates of exocrine glands , remarkable B cell hyperreactivity and a strong predisposition to B cell neoplasia .
In this study , c-myc protooncogene mRNA expression in 29 labial minor salivary gland biopsies from patients with primary SS and 15 controls was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry .
Two 40mer oligonucleotides from the 1st and the 2nd exon of the c-myc gene , labeled with 35S , were used as probes .
To detect the origin of the cell hybridized with a c-myc probe , a combined immunochemistry in situ hybridization histochemistry technique was used .
High c-myc mRNA expression was detected on acinar epithelial cells .
c-myc did not correlate with c-fos and c-jun protein expression .
Stronger c-myc mRNA expression was detected in labial salivary glands of patients with longer disease duration ( p less than or equal to 0.002 ) and more intense T lymphocyte infiltrates ( p less than 0.05 ) although these patients revealed no hypergammaglobulinemia .
No correlation was observed between c-myc mRNA and B lymphocyte monoclonicity or lymphoma .
In conclusion , strong c-myc mRNA expression was observed on epithelial cells of labial salivary glands from patients with primary SS .
Our findings may indicate the presence of a reactivated virus hosted in these cells .
For the study of the changes in plasma interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and their possible relationship with the changes in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) , plasma IL-1 and GR in peripheral blood leukocytes in aged long-distance runner were measured simultaneously .
The activity of IL-1 was expressed as its ability to stimulate 3H-TdR incorporation in the thymocytes of C57 mice .
GR was determined by whole cell assay with 3H-Dex .
The results showed that the activity of plasma IL-1 in aged long-distance runner was 209 % , 223 % and 145 % of the control at 14.7-18.7 , 3.8-7.0 and 1.5-2.6 KD fractions .
The GR in peripheral blood leukocytes in aged runner was 65 % of the control .
Possible relationship between the changes in IL-1 and GR in aged long-distance runner and its physiological significance are discussed .
The transcription factor GATA-1 is expressed in a subset of hemopoietic cells , where it mediates the cell-type specific expression of several genes .
We have cloned the mouse and human GATA-1 genes .
A region upstream to the first exon , and highly conserved between mouse and man , acts as an erythroid specific enhancer in transient assays , if linked to the GATA-1 or to the SV40 promoter .
The activity of the enhancer is almost completely dependent on the integrity of a dimeric GATA-1 binding site .
We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by clone pAT 133 , which is induced upon transition from a resting state ( G0 ) through the early phase of the cell cycle ( G1 ) .
The pAT 133 gene is immediately induced , with FOS-like kinetics , in human T cells and in fibroblasts .
Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three tandem zinc-finger sequences of the type Cys2-Xaa12-His2 .
This zinc-finger region , which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner , is similar ( greater than 80 % on the amino acid level ) to two previously described transcription factors pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 .
Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains , the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct .
This structural similarity suggests that the pAT 133 gene encodes a transcription factor with a specific biological function .
Comparing the regulation of these related zinc-finger-encoding genes showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T lymphocytes and of resting fibroblasts .
However , upon transition from a proliferating ( G1 ) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated .
In human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed , whereas mRNA of pAT 225/EGR1 was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation .
In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591/EGR2 was not expressed in these cells .
This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins .
In vitro effects of aldosterone on the intracellular concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium , cell volume and the sodium-proton-antiport have been described in intact human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) .
In the present paper , the binding of a [125I]-labeled aldosterone derivative to plasma membrane rich fractions of HML was studied .
High affinity binding of the radioligand with an apparent Kd of approximately 0.1 nM was found .
Aldosterone displaced the tracer at a similar Kd .
Both canrenone and cortisol were inactive as ligands up to concentrations of 0.1 microM .
The findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding sites with a high affinity for aldosterone , but not for cortisol .
These data are perfectly compatible with major properties of steroidal effects on the sodium-proton-antiport in HML and thus very likely represent membrane receptors for aldosterone .
Fibronectin synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to promote CD4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when CD4 cells were cultured with anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone .
In addition , anti-CD29 ( integrin beta 1 ) as well as anti-VLA-5 ( human fibronectin receptor ) antibodies blocked this CD4 cell activation in this system .
Although anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone can not induce IL-2 message by CD4 cells , the combination of anti-CD3 plus fibronectin induced IL-2 message by CD4 cells .
In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated , we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the CD3 pathway of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor .
Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin .
The KBF1 factor , which binds to the enhancer A located in the promoter of the mouse MHC class I gene H-2Kb , is indistinguishable from the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B , which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .
The KBF1/p50 factor binds as a homodimer but can also form heterodimers with the products of other members of the same family , like the c-rel and v-rel ( proto ) oncogenes .
The dimerization domain of KBF1/p50 is contained between amino acids 201 and 367 .
A mutant of KBF1/p50 ( delta SP ) , unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers , has been constructed .
This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of wild-type proteins of the same family ( KBF1/p50 , c- and v-rel ) .
This mutant also functions in vivo as a trans-acting dominant negative regulator : the transcriptional inducibility of the HIV long terminal repeat ( which contains two potential NF-kappa B binding sites ) by phorbol ester ( PMA ) is inhibited when it is co-transfected into CD4+ T cells with the delta SP mutant .
Similarly the basal as well as TNF or IL1-induced activity of the MHC class I H-2Kb promoter can be inhibited by this mutant in two different cell lines .
These results constitute the first formal demonstration that these genes are regulated by members of the rel/NF-kappa B family .
Lymphoid differentiation is one of the best studied examples of mammalian development .
Here Hans Clevers and Michael Owen describe how the cloning of the genes that encode T-cell-specific membrane proteins allows the identification of transcription factors that control the expression of these T-cell genes .
Such transcription factors play a key role in the development of the mature T-cell phenotype by functioning as ' master regulators of T-cell differentiation ' .
The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation , two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection .
Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures .
In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production .
We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat .
Furthermore , CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer .
These studies suggest that interaction of CD2 with its natural ligand , LFA-3 , may play a role in regulation of HIV expression .
Cyclosporin A and FK506 are immunosuppressive compounds that have similar inhibitory effects on the expression of several lymphokines produced by T lymphocytes .
Despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different cytosolic protein , cyclophilin and FKBP respectively , which raises the possibility that they have different modes of action .
Using constructs in which mRNA production controlled by a specific transcription factor could be readily measured we found that both cyclosporin A and FK506 completely inhibited transcription activated by NF-AT , NFIL2 A , NFIL2 B and partially inhibited transcription activated by NF kappa B .
Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on Ca2+ mobilization .
However , cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit Ca2+ mobilization dependent expression of c-fos mRNA indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by Ca2+ is sensitive to these drugs .
Furthermore , we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on six different transcription factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel Ca2+ dependent step that regulates several transcription factors .
The hepatitis B virus genome encodes a transcriptional transactivator protein designated HBxAg .
We have investigated whether this antigen is a target structure for human T-lymphocytes .
Using recombinant HBxAg protein , we found HBxAg-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection ( 6 of 6 ) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection ( 6 of 17 ) but not in healthy individuals .
With HBxAg-specific synthetic polypeptides , several T-cell epitopes were identified .
Most were located in the carboxyterminal half of the HBxAg protein .
Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive , CD8-negative subtype .
These data establish for the first time HBxAg as an antigen in the cellular immune response .
The design of combination hormonal and immunotherapeutic protocols for breast cancer patients may be facilitated by analysis of preclinical in vitro model systems .
Estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ : MCF-7 ) and negative ( ER- : MDA-MB-231 ) human breast cancer cell lines were utilized to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen ( TAM ) and estradiol ( E2 ) on modulation of breast cancer target susceptibility to lysis by lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells .
E2-stimulated ER+ cells were more susceptible to lysis by LAK cells than corresponding TAM-treated or control cells , while treatment of ER- cells with either E2 or TAM alone did not alter from control their susceptibility to this immune-mediated lysis .
All ER+ and ER- cells tested remained sensitive after treatment with TAM to lysis by LAK cells .
In addition , an adenocarcinoma reactive human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody ( ING-1 ) was able to significantly boost in vivo generated LAK cell-mediated lysis of control , E2-treated , and TAM-treated ER+ and ER- cells .
These in vitro results provide a preclinical rationale for in vivo testing of TAM , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , and breast cancer reactive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity facilitating antibody in patients with refractory or high risk breast cancer .
The effects of human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection on cellular differentiation and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity have been investigated in a new model of myeloid differentiation .
PLB-985 cells represent a bipotential myelomonoblastic cell population capable of either granulocytic or monocytic differentiation after induction with appropriate inducers .
By virtue of the presence of CD4 on the cell surface , PLB-985 cells were chronically infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB .
PLB-IIIB cells clearly possessed a more monocytic phenotype than the parental myeloblasts , as determined by differential staining , increased expression of the myeloid-specific surface markers , and transcription of the c-fms proto-oncogene .
NF-kappa B binding activity was inducible by tumor necrosis factor and phorbol myristate acetate in PLB-985 .
However , in PLB-IIIB cells , constitutive expression of a novel NF-kappa B complex was detected , composed of proteins ranging between 70 and 110 kD .
These proteins interacted specifically with the symmetric NF-kappa B site from the interferon beta ( IFN-beta ) promoter .
Mutations affecting the 5' guanine residues of the kappa B site were unable to compete for these NF-kappa B-related proteins .
Inducibility of endogenous IFN-beta and IFN-alpha RNA was also increased in PLB-IIIB cells .
These studies indicate that HIV-1 infection of myelomonoblastic cells may select for a more mature monocytic phenotype and that unique subunit associations of NF-kappa B DNA binding proteins may contribute to differential NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression .
Stimulation of T cells with antigen results in activation of several kinases , including protein kinase C ( PKC ) , that may mediate the later induction of activation-related genes .
We have examined the potential role of PKC in induction of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene in T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex .
We have previously shown that prolonged treatment of the untransformed T cell clone Ar-5 with phorbol esters results in downmodulation of the alpha and beta isozymes of PKC , and abrogates induction of IL-2 mRNA and protein .
Here we show that phorbol ester treatment also abolishes induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Ar-5 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter linked to this reporter gene .
The IL-2 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factors including NFAT-1 , Oct , NF-kappa B , and AP-1 , which are all potentially sensitive to activation of PKC .
We show that induction of a trimer of the NFAT and Oct sites is not sensitive to phorbol ester treatment , and that mutations in the NF-kappa B site have no effect on inducibility of the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast , mutations in the AP-1 site located at -150 bp almost completely abrogate induction of the IL-2 promoter , and appearance of an inducible nuclear factor binding to this site is sensitive to PKC depletion .
Moreover , cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells .
Our results indicate that the AP-1 site at -150 bp represents a major , if not the only , site of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter .
Terminal differentiation of the leukemic cell lines U-937 and HL-60 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by marked changes in gene expression .
In this study , we demonstrate that the expression of jun and fos gene family members is induced with variable kinetics during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced differentiation , with c-jun expression best paralleling differentiation .
The generation of AP-1 complexes , as measured by DNA binding activity , closely parallels morphological differentiation .
Furthermore , the ability of these complexes to regulate gene expression is demonstrated by increased transcription from an AP-1 driven reporter construct and marked increases in the expression of endogenous AP-1 regulated genes .
Differentiation assays using water soluble phorbol esters reveal that differentiation becomes irreversible soon after AP-1 appears .
This tight correlation between c-jun expression , the generation of AP-1 activity , and differentiation suggests a critical role for this gene and transcriptional complex during this process .
The two nuclear proteins NF-kappa B ( consisting of subunits p50 and p65 ) and the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B ( p50 ) by itself , also called KBF1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human T-cell line IARC 301.5 .
In order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa B enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301.5 and a murine myeloma .
Most hybrids express both KBF1 and NF-kappa B in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only KBF1 .
The kappa B enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear NF-kappa B .
These findings show that nuclear NF-kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer , while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient .
We propose that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of NF-kappa B and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes during the immune response .
The human interferon beta ( IFN-beta ) regulatory element consists of multiple enhanson domains which are targets for transcription factors involved in inducible expression of the promoter .
To further characterize the protein-DNA interactions mediating IFN-beta induction , positive regulatory domain ( PRD ) II binding proteins were purified from phorbol ester induced Jurkat T-cells and from IFN primed , cycloheximide/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treated HeLa S3 cells .
From HeLa cells , two major proteins of 52 and 45 kilodaltons ( kD ) copurified with DNA binding activity , whereas from T-cells , four proteins -- a major protein of 52 kD and three minor proteins of 82 , 67 , and 43-47 kD -- were purified .
Also , an induction specific DNA binding protein was purified from HeLa cells that interacted with the ( AAGTGA ) 4 tetrahexamer sequence and the PRDI domain .
This protein is immunologically distinct from IRF-1/ISGF2 .
Uninduced or Sendai virus induced HeLa extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of IFN beta promoter deletions .
Deletions upstream of the PRDII element increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter .
A 2-4-fold increase in IFN-beta promoter transcription was observed in Sendai virus induced extracts , and deletion of PRDI and PRDII elements decreased this induced level of transcription .
When purified PRDII and tetrahexamer binding proteins were added to the induced extract , a 4-fold increase in transcription was observed .
These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to modulate IFN-beta transcription in vitro but indicate that additional proteins may be required to fully activate IFN-beta transcription .
Plasma cortisol concentration and blood leukocyte content of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) were assayed in 20 patients with deficiency syndromes , 10 cold in property ( deficiency-cold ) , the other 10 hot in property ( deficiency-heat ) , and also in 10 healthy individuals as normal control for the purpose of investigating the nature of cold and heat syndromes .
As a result , the cases of deficiency-cold syndrome ( DCS ) had a normal concentration of plasma cortisol but a lowered content of GCR in leukocytes when compared with the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) ; the cases of deficiency-heat syndrome ( DHS ) had a higher concentration of plasma cortisol than the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) and a slightly higher content of GCR in leukocytes .
It was concluded that the DCS is characterized by diminished biological effects of adrenocortical activity , while the DHS , by augmented biological effects of adrenocortical activity .
We have recently identified and cloned TCF-1 , a T cell-specific transcription factor with specificity for the AACAAAG motif in the CD3 epsilon enhancer and for the TTCAAAG motif in the TCR alpha enhancer .
TCF-1 belongs to the family of transcription-regulating proteins which share a region of homology termed the HMG-box .
Here , we show by gel retardation analysis that TCF-1 specifically recognizes the T beta 5 element of the TCR beta enhancer and the T delta 7 element of the TCR delta enhancer .
Comparison of the sequences of all elements recognized by TCF-1 defines a consensus motif A/T A/T C A A/G A G .
These observations imply that TCF-1 is involved in the control of several T cell-specific genes and might thus play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the mature T cell phenotype .
ER content in lymphocytes of peripheral blood from 27 SLE patients and 20 healthy controls were determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay .
ER content in lymphocytes of each sample was expressed by both fmol/mg of lymphocyte cytosolic protein and fmol/micrograms of lymphocyte DNA .
The results showed that there was no significant difference between the ER content of lymphocytes from the controls and that from patients with SLE .
But the logarithmic mean of ER content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/mg of cytosolic protein , in 14 patients with active SLE ( 0.9356 +/- 0.31 ) was significantly higher than that in 13 patients with inactive SLE ( 0.2979 +/- 0.23 , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 0.6204 +/- 0.52 , P less than 0.001 ) .
The normal upper limit of ER content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/micrograms of DNA , was 0.136 .
The elevated rate of ER content in lymphocytes in 14 active SLE ( 92.9 % ) was also higher than that in quieiescent patients ( 23.1 % , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 10 % , P less than 0.001 ) .
Moreover , the elevated level of ER content was found to be related to the positive antidsDNA antibody and hypocomplementemia .
During latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of human B lymphocytes , six viral nuclear antigen ( EBNAs ) are expressed from long primary transcripts by means of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylylation sites .
These transcripts initiate from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , that function in a mutually exclusive fashion .
Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of primary B lymphocytes , followed by a switch to Cp usage .
These studies have been extended to show that ( i ) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes , although the virus contains a functional Cp ; ( ii ) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes , but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences ; ( iii ) this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer ; and ( iv ) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
These results support a model for viral promoter switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of EBNA 2 , followed by activation of Cp through the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
Glucocorticosteroids remain the major treatment modality for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , but their mechanism of action is unclear .
Over the past decade it has become clear that glucocorticosteroid receptors play a significant role in the mechanism of glucocorticosteroid action .
We studied glucocorticosteroid receptor density and affinity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the glucocorticosteroid binding assay in 33 patients with SLE who had taken no glucocorticosteroid for the previous 6 months and in 32 healthy controls .
Patients ' disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) .
Glucocorticosteroid receptors on leukocytes of patients with SLE were significantly higher than in healthy controls ( 4419 +/- 306 vs 3369 +/- 196 , p less than 0.005 ) .
The binding affinity was not different between patients and controls .
There was no correlation between glucocorticosteroid receptor number and SLE disease activity .
Macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) , also referred to as CSF-1 , regulates the survival , growth , differentiation and functional activity of monocytes by binding to a single class of high-affinity cell surface receptors , known to be the product of the c-fms protooncogene .
The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the monocyte lineage has suggested that M-CSF may act by an autocrine mechanism .
Interestingly , it has been shown that M-CSF can induce the expression of its own gene .
Although sensitivity to M-CSF can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function , M-CSF responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level .
To date , little is known about the intracellular pathway of M-CSF signal transduction .
We have therefore investigated the changes in protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity upon exposure of monocytes to M-CSF .
We show that M-CSF activates and translocates PKC .
Inhibition of PKC by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of M-CSF by M-CSF .
Furthermore , activation of PKC was pertussis-toxin-sensitive and was associated with the detection of an NF kappa B protein in nuclear extracts of M-CSF-induced blood monocytes but not in monocytes exposed to medium treatment only .
The results suggest that M-CSF induction of M-CSF involves G proteins , PKC and NF kappa B .
OBJECTIVE : The aim was to explore the down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptors during hypercortisolaemia in anorexia nervosa .
DESIGN : Urine and plasma samples were obtained for cortisol determination and blood lymphocytes were isolated for receptor binding studies .
PATIENTS : Sixteen anorexic patients , aged 16-27 years , with a mean +/- SEM body mass index of 14.2 +/- 2.0 ( ranging from 11.1 to 17.4 ) , and 15 normal women were studied .
Six patients were reinvestigated after a significant weight gain .
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured with dexamethasone as ligand on lymphocytes .
RESULTS : In patients , both total and free plasma cortisol concentrations were higher than in the normal women , as was their urinary free cortisol ; the number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell ( Ro ) and the binding affinity ( Kd ) for dexamethasone were , however , not significantly different ( Ro : 7687 +/- 1750 vs 7347 +/- 1285 sites/cell ; Kd : 7.7 +/- 2.4 vs 7.4 +/- 1.7 nM at 24 degrees C ) .
After weight gain ( 14 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 2 kg/m2 ) , receptor numbers were 8421 +/- 2126 ( pre ) and 9011 +/- 500 ( post ) sites/cell , which are not significantly different ( P greater than 0.2 ) ; the Kd was unchanged ( 9.3 +/- 2.6 vs 9.2 +/- 2.4 nM ) .
CONCLUSIONS Hypercortisolaemia does not down-regulate the lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors in anorexia nervosa and a post-receptor defect might be involved in peripheral tissue resistance to the effects of glucocorticoid hormones in undernutrition .
The inducible , T cell-specific enhancers of murine and human Interleukin 2 ( Il-2 ) genes contain the kB-like sequence GGGATTTCACC as an essential cis-acting enhancer motif .
When cloned in multiple copies this so-called TCEd ( distal T cell element ) acts as an inducible proto-enhancer element in E14 T lymphoma cells , but not in HeLa cells .
In extracts of induced , Il-2 secreting El4 cells three individual protein factors bind to TCEd DNA .
The binding of the most prominent factor , named TCF-1 ( T cell factor 1 ) , is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of TCEd .
TCF-1 consists of two polypeptides of about 50 kD and 105 kD ; the former seems to be related to the 50 kD polypeptide of NF-kB .
Purified NF-kB is also able to bind to the TCEd , but TCF-1 binds stronger than NF-kB to TCEd DNA .
The conversion of the TCEd to a ' perfect ' NF-kB binding site leads to a tighter binding of NF-kB to TCEd DNA and , as a functional consequence , to the activity of the ' converted ' TCEd motifs in HeLa cells .
Thus , the substitution of the underlined A residue to a C within the GGGATTTCACC motif abolishes its T cell-restricted activity and leads to its functioning in both El4 cells and HeLa cells .
These results indicate that lymphocyte-specific factors binding to the TCEd are involved in the control of T cell specific-transcription of the Il-2 gene .
Although monocytic cells can provide a reservoir for viral production in vivo , their regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription can be either latent , restricted , or productive .
These differences in gene expression have not been molecularly defined .
In THP-1 cells with restricted HIV expression , there is an absence of DNA-protein binding complex formation with the HIV-1 promoter-enhancer associated with markedly less viral RNA production .
This absence of binding was localized to the NF-kappa B region of the HIV-1 enhancer ; the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa NF-kappa B heterodimer was preferentially lost .
Adding purified NF-kappa B protein to nuclear extracts from cells with restricted expression overcomes this lack of binding .
In addition , treatment of these nuclear extracts with sodium deoxycholate restored their ability to form the heterodimer , suggesting the presence of an inhibitor of NF-kappa B activity .
Furthermore , treatment of nuclear extracts from these cells that had restricted expression with lipopolysaccharide increased viral production and NF-kappa B activity .
Antiserum specific for NF-kappa B binding proteins , but not c-rel-specific antiserum , disrupted heterodimer complex formation .
Thus , both NF-kappa B-binding complexes are needed for optimal viral transcription .
Binding of the 65-kDa plus 50-kDa heterodimer to the HIV-1 enhancer can be negatively regulated in monocytes , providing one mechanism restricting HIV-1 gene expression .
A total of 37 chronic , severe , nonsmoking asthmatic patients with documented reversible airways obstruction were classified as glucocorticoid-sensitive or -resistant on the basis of changes in FEV1 , FVC , and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) after oral prednisolone .
The resistant patients showed no significant improvements in airflow limitation .
Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes from the sensitive but not the resistant asthmatic patients was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) inhibited by dexamethasone ( 10(-7) mol/L ) , reflecting a shift of the dose-response curve .
When all the asthmatic patients were analyzed together , there was a significant correlation between the degree of sensitivity of T cells to dexamethasone and the clinical responsiveness to prednisolone ( p less than 0.01 ) .
No differences were observed between six of the sensitive and resistant patients in the clearance of plasma prednisolone derived from orally administered prednisone .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors were also characterized in five sensitive and seven resistant patients .
The numbers and binding affinities of these receptors could not account for the observed difference in the susceptibility of these cells to functional inhibition by dexamethasone in vitro .
These results suggest that clinical glucocorticoid resistance in chronic asthma does not reflect abnormal glucocorticoid clearance but may be due at least partly to a relative insensitivity of T lymphocytes to glucocorticoids .
This lack of sensitivity is unexplained but is not attributable to abnormalities of cellular glucocorticoid receptors .
Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate interleukin-1 beta production in monocytic cells by two different mechanims : direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed interleukin-1 beta mRNA .
Now we have examined the effect of the nature of the monocyte activating signal on these two inhibitory mechanims .
When human monocytes were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate , it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta protein production , but the phorbol myristate-induced production was increased 3-10 fold .
This difference was also seen at the mRNA level .
When dexamethasone was added to the cultures 3 hours after the stimulators , it clearly decreased the interleukin-1 beta mRNA levels regardless of the stimulator used ( although the effect was clearly weaker on the PMA-induced mRNA ) .
Thus these data suggest that the phorbol myristate-induced signal ( prolonged protein kinase C activation ? ) can not be inhibited by prior incubation with dexamethasone and it also protects the induced mRNA for the degradative action of dexamethasone .
Interrelations between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system ( HPA ) and the immune system represent a well-documented biological phenomenon .
While in vitro administration of glucocorticoids may inhibit concanavalin A ( Con A ) - and phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced T-cell proliferation , pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) -driven B-cell mitogenesis is relatively resistant to glucocorticoids .
To further explore the link between the HPA and the immune system in relation to glucocorticoid receptor function , dose-response curves were obtained for Con A- and PHA -induced T-cell mitogenesis , PWM-generated B-cell mitogenesis and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in 13 healthy controls .
Glucocorticoid effects were assessed in vivo by depletion of endogenous glucocorticoids after oral administration of 1.5 g metyrapone ( MET ) and subsequent glucocorticoid replacement , and in vitro by incubation of the cells with different doses of dexamethasone ( DEX ) .
There was a significant decrease in PWM-induced B-cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of DEX administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after MET treatment when compared with the DEX plus MET pretreated condition in vivo .
These data suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro is related to glucocorticoid receptor function .
The decrease in PWM-generated B-cell proliferation following cortisol depletion by MET may be seen in connection with impaired glucocorticoid-mediated induction of interleukin-1 receptor synthesis .
Glucocorticoids kill certain types of lymphoblasts , but the mechanisms are unknown .
It is clear that sufficient numbers of functional glucocorticoid receptors are required to mediate lysis , but whether they do so through the classical model of steroid hormone activation and modulation of gene expression has not been established .
In this report we have asked which region ( s ) of the steroid receptor are important for mediating lysis in leukemic T lymphoblasts .
CEM-ICR 27 leukemic lymphoblasts , a clone of CEM cells which lack functional glucocorticoid receptors and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing glutamine synthetase induction , were provided with steroid receptors by DNA transfections of various receptor gene constructs .
We measured steroid mediated lysis , receptor number and induction of glutamine synthetase in the transfected cells .
Our results provide evidence that the lysis mechanism in the ICR27 lymphoblasts is restored when functional receptor number is restored .
The DNA binding region specifying high affinity for GRE sites is required .
Lysis is mediated by any steroid that allows for activation of the receptor containing such a region .
Our data support the view that steroid-mediated cell death occurs by a process requiring direct interaction of steroid-receptor complexes with the genome .
A new B-cell-specific enhancer element has been identified 3' of E4 and the octamerlike motifs in the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer .
Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluI fragment , when fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the conalbumin promoter , stimulated transcription in B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells .
Footprinting analysis revealed that the identical sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG , designated E6 , was protected by nuclear extracts from B cells , T cells , or HeLa cells .
Gel mobility shift assays using a synthetic E6 motif detected a B-cell-specific complex in addition to a ubiquitous band found also in T cells and HeLa cells .
In agreement with the results of gel retardation assays , tandem copies of the E6 motif stimulated transcription in ARH77 and Raji cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells .
Furthermore , a mutant E6 motif lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity .
In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a B-cell-specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .
Interestingly , the MnlI-AluI fragment could suppress the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells .
Moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the MnlI-AluI fragment in HeLa cells but not in B cells .
Thus , the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both positive and negative factors .
CD3-epsilon expression is controlled by a downstream T lymphocyte-specific enhancer element .
We report the identification of a T cell-specific transcription factor , TCF-1 , binding to this element .
The multimerized recognition motif of TCF-1 constituted a T cell-specific enhancer .
Subsequent cloning of TCF-1 identified three splice alternatives .
TCF-1 contained a single DNA-binding HMG box most closely related to similar boxes in the putative mammalian sex-determining gene SRY and in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mc mating type gene .
TCF-1 mRNA was expressed uniquely in T lymphocytes .
Upon cotransfection into non-T cells , TCF-1 could transactivate through its cognate motif .
These results identify TCF-1 as a T cell-specific transcription factor , which might play a role in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype .
A DNA probe that spanned a domain conserved among the proto-oncogene c-rel , the Drosophila morphogen dorsal , and the p50 DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B was generated from Jurkat T cell complementary DNA with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and degenerate oligonucleotides .
This probe was used to identify a rel-related complementary DNA that hybridized to a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA present in human T and B lymphocytes .
In vitro transcription and translation of the complementary DNA resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of 65 kilodaltons ( kD ) .
The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif .
This protein-DNA complex comigrated with the complex obtained with the purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit and binding was inhibited by I kappa B-alpha and -beta proteins .
In addition , the 65-kD protein associated with the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B and the kappa B probe to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the NF-kappa B-DNA complex .
Therefore the rel-related 65-kD protein may represent the p65 subunit of the active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex .
The human T cell-specific transcription factor TCF-1 alpha plays a key role in the tissue-specific activation of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) C alpha enhancer and binds to pyrimidine-rich elements ( 5'-PyCTTTG-3' ) present in a variety of other T cell-specific control regions .
Using amino acid sequence information derived from the DNA affinity-purified protein , we have now isolated cDNA clones encoding TCF-1 alpha .
The TCF-1 alpha cDNA contains a single 68-amino-acid domain that is homologous to a region conserved among high-mobility group ( HMG ) and nonhistone chromosomal proteins .
Expression of full-length and mutant cDNA clones in bacteria reveal that the single HMG motif , which is predicted to contain two extended alpha-helical segments , is sufficient to direct the sequence-specific binding of TCF-1 alpha to DNA .
Northern blot experiments demonstrate further that TCF-1 alpha mRNA is highly tissue specific , found primarily in the thymus or T cell lines .
The immature CEM T cell line expresses relatively low levels of TCF-1 alpha mRNA , which are increased upon activation of these cells by phorbol esters .
Interestingly , the cloned TCF-1 alpha protein is a potent transcriptional activator of the human TCR alpha enhancer in nonlymphoid cell lines , whereas the activity of the endogenous protein in T cell lines is strongly dependent on an additional T cell-specific protein that interacts with the core enhancer .
TCF-1 alpha is currently unique among the newly emerging family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins that share the HMG motif in that it is a highly tissue-specific RNA polymerase II transcription factor .
A family of transcriptional activators has recently been identified in chickens ; these transcriptional activators recognize a common consensus motif ( WGATAR ) through a conserved C4 zinc finger DNA-binding domain .
One of the members of this multigene family , cGATA-3 , is most abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte cell lineage .
Analysis of human and murine GATA-3 factors shows a striking degree of amino acid sequence identity and similar patterns of tissue specificity of expression in these three organisms .
The murine and human factors are abundantly expressed in a variety of human and murine T-cell lines and can activate transcription through a tissue-specific GATA-binding site identified within the human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer .
We infer that the murine and human GATA-3 proteins play a central and highly conserved role in vertebrate T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation .
A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene .
This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains , which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins .
Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated .
One of these , designated Rhom-2 , is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13 , where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur ; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene .
Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and , like rhombotin , encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains .
Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system , lung , kidney , liver , and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus .
The other gene , designated Rhom-3 , is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin .
Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors , the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined .
A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example .
Therefore , chromosome bands 11p15 ( rhombotin ) and 11p13 ( Rhom-2 ) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia , with the 11p15 target more rarely involved .
The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains .
The minimal region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene promoter necessary for its transcriptional induction by phorbol esters ( PMA ) in human T and B lymphocyte cell lines has been localized between -52 and +89 nucleotides ( nt ) relative to the gene 's transcriptional start site .
Comparison of these sequences to those required to mediate virus or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the gene reveal significant differences , and thus , the sequence requirements for PMA induction are distinct from those that mediate induction by virus or LPS .
Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter ( kappa 1 , kappa 2 , and kappa 3 ) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts , TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines .
Moreover , kappa 1 - kappa 3 can each be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA .
Therefore , TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA , like its induction by virus and LPS , is not primarily mediated by NF-kappa B , but rather is mediated through other sequences and protein factors .
Surprisingly , multimers of kappa 1 - kappa 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B ( Raji ) , but not a T ( HUT78 ) cell line .
However they are not functional on a truncated TNF-alpha promoter , indicating that promoter context and cell type specificity influence the PMA inducible function of these NF-kappa B binding sites .
In this study we present evidence for reactivity of pregnancy lymphocytes , but not nonpregnancy lymphocytes , with the progesterone receptor-specific monoclonal antibody mPRI .
Using an avidin-biotin peroxidase detection system , we found a nuclear staining in 14.6 +/- 3.7 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 27 ) of pregnancy lymphocytes , while only 0.47 +/- 0.33 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 15 ) of nonpregnancy lymphocytes reacted with the antibody .
To characterize the receptor-bearing subset , CD8+ and CD4+ cells were depleted by complement-dependent lysis .
Depletion of CD8+ cells was accompanied by 62 +/- 18 % loss of progesterone receptor-bearing cells , while depletion of CD4+ cells resulted in a twofold increase in the number of positively staining lymphocytes .
In nonpregnancy lymphocytes a 3-day PHA treatment , as well as allogeneic stimulation , resulted in a significant increase in the number of receptor-containing cells .
These results suggest that pregnancy , but not nonpregnancy , lymphocytes contain progesterone binding structures , and that these are inducible by mitogenic or alloantigenic stimuli .
To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( OCTA ) -nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor , designated NF-microB , in the murine IgH enhancer .
We demonstrate that the NF-microB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .
This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .
Moreover , combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .
Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .
Nevertheless , a multimer of the microB motif alone showed no enhancer activity .
DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microB DNA motif .
Our results suggest that the microB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity .
The clinical implications of nuclear T3R alterations of circulating lymphocytes in hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases were investigated .
Nuclear T3R in lymphocytes was determined by radio-ligand binding analysis .
The results showed that in hyper- and hypothyroid patients the nuclear affinity ( Ka ) for T3 was similar to that of normal subjects .
In hyperthyroidism nuclear T3 maximal binding capacity ( MBC ) was unaltered , whereas in hypothyroidism the MBC was significantly increased .
In the patients with diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure and hepatic cirrhosis , the nuclear T3R MBC of lymphocytes was about 1.5-1.6 times of the normal controls .
It was concluded that there existed hormonal regulation of nuclear T3R , and up-regulation was seen in hypothyroidism and low T3 syndrome .
The sexual difference in the incidence of autoimmune diseases has remained an enigma for many years .
In the examination of the induction of autoimmunity in transgenic mice , evidence has been obtained further implicating the lymphokine interferon-gamma in the etiology of autoimmunity .
Sex steroid regulation of the production of this molecule , as well as other cytokines , may help explain the gender-specific differences in the immune system , including autoimmunity .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes through their antigen receptor leads to the appearance of several transcription factors , including NF-AT and NF-kappa B , which are involved in regulating genes required for immunologic activation .
To investigate the activity of a single transcription factor in individual viable cells , we have applied an assay that uses the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to quantitate beta-galactosidase ( beta-gal ) .
We have analyzed the distribution of NF-AT transcriptional activity among T cells undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the NF-AT-binding site directs transcription of the lacZ gene .
Unexpectedly , stimulation of cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express no beta-gal and others express high levels .
This expression pattern can not be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation .
Further results , in which beta-gal activity is correlated with NF-AT-binding activity , indicate that the concentration of NF-AT must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates .
This threshold likely reflects the NF-AT concentration-dependent assembly of transcription complexes at the promoter .
Similar constructs controlled by NF-kappa B or the entire interleukin-2 enhancer show bimodal expression patterns during induction , suggesting that thresholds set by the concentration of transcription factors may be a common property of inducible genes .
Multiple regulatory elements in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat ( HIV LTR ) are required for activation of HIV gene expression .
Previous transfection studies of HIV LTR constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that multiple regulatory regions including the enhancer , SP1 , TATA and TAR regions were important for HIV gene expression .
To characterize these regulatory elements further , mutations in these regions were inserted into both the 5' and 3' HIV LTRs and infectious proviral constructs were assembled .
These constructs were transfected into either HeLa cells , Jurkat cells or U937 cells in both the presence and absence of phorbol esters which have previously been demonstrated to activate HIV gene expression .
Viral gene expression was assayed by the level of p24 gag protein released from cultures transfected with the proviral constructs .
Results in all cell lines indicated that mutations of the SP1 , TATA and the TAR loop and stem secondary structure resulted in marked decreases in gene expression while mutations of the enhancer motif or TAR primary sequence resulted in only slight decreases .
However , viruses containing mutations in either the TAR loop sequences or stem secondary structure which were very defective for gene expression in untreated Jurkat cells , gave nearly wild-type levels of gene expression in phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells but not in phorbol ester-treated HeLa or U937 cells .
High level gene expression of these TAR mutant constructs in phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells was eliminated by second site mutations in the enhancer region or by disruption of the tat gene .

We show that in the human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line Molt4 c-myc mRNA and protein expression is down-regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore A23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration .
A block to RNA elongation is largely responsible for decreased c-myc transcription .
Although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .
The calcium ionophore-induced c-myc suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis .
Therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in c-myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .
The latter one appears to be mediated by a rapidly calcium-dependent induced gene product .
A 52-year-old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which appeared first during childhood , increased in frequency without goiter or exophthalmos .
Cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded .
The thyroid function was normal regarding T4 , free T4 and T3 , TBG , radioiodine uptake , TSH and T3 suppressibility ; however the TSH response to TRH was decreased .
The lymphocyte nuclear T3 receptor was found with an affinity close to that of normal volunteers ( Ka : 1.42 x 10(10) M-1 vs 1.95 +/- 0.35 x 10(10) M-1 ) and a binding capacity markedly increased ( 9.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.4 fmol T3 / 100 micrograms DNA ) .
Pindolol was inefficient on the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug .
Under carbimazole , the plasma T4 markedly decreased ( 27.7 +/- 3.6 nmol/l ) but the patient remained euthyroid .
The clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the heart to thyroid hormones , associated with an increased number of T3 nuclear receptor sites in lymphocytes .
The expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or its enhancer sequence and the translocation of the HIV enhancer-binding protein NF-kappa B were analyzed in two human T-cell clones stimulated through their T-cell receptor complex or by tumor necrosis factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
We found a dissociation of NF-kappa B translocation from transactivation of either the HIV LTR or the HIV enhancer .
Interleukin 2 induced proliferation but not NF-kappa B translocation or LTR transactivation .
Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced HIV LTR transactivation , whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 did not .
The two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce NF-kappa B translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester .
Our finding that induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is not sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation .
Furthermore , our results suggest that events linked to T-cell activation , in addition to NF-kappa B translocation per se , induce functional interactions of the NF-kappa B complex with the HIV enhancer .
A primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is lymphoid cells .
However , analysis of the viral control elements and the cellular factors that regulate adenoviral gene expression in lymphocytes has not been reported .
The adenovirus early region 3 ( ES ) gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the class I MHC antigens , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction .
To determine whether different cellular factors were involved in E3 regulation in lymphocytes as compared with HeLa cells , both DNA binding and transfection analysis with the E3 promoter in both cell types were performed .
These studies detected two novel domains referred to as L1 and L2 with a variety of lymphoid but not HeLa extracts .
Each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor NF-kappa B .
Transfections of E3 constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene revealed that mutagenesis of the distal NF-kappa B motif ( L2 ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in HeLa cells , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by lymphoid cells .
In contrast , mutagenesis of proximal NF-kappa B motif ( L1 ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both HeLa cells and lymphoid cells but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in lymphoid cells when coupled to the L2 mutation .
Reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the L1 and L2 domains indicated that the primary sequence of these motifs rather than their position in the E3 promoter was critical for regulating gene expression .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
In vitro binding of aldosterone to mineralocorticoid receptors on human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) and its effects on the intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations of HML have already been described .
In the present paper this easily accessible human cell model was investigated in 13 patients with essential hypertension .
In only four patients sodium in HML without incubation was elevated compared with the range for normal persons .
A decrease of intracellular sodium or potassium occurred during incubation without aldosterone ( P less than 0.02 ) .
The addition of 1.4 nM aldosterone did not prevent this loss of electrolytes as observed in normal persons .
Plasma renin activity and aldosterone were not correlated with the electrolyte response and were within the normal limits .
The number of mineralocorticoid receptors/cell were within or close to the normal range ( n = 9 ) .
The independence of intracellular electrolytes from aldosterone despite a normal number of mineralocorticoid receptors may reflect an impairment of the mineralocorticoid effector mechanism in the HML of patients with essential hypertension .
Lymphocyte cell lines were established from five patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets , type II ( VDDR-II ) .
These lines were established by infection with human T-lymphotrophic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) .
Binding of [3H]1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) to its receptor in these cell lines was compared to binding studies using a T-lymphocyte cell line ( S-LB1 ) from a normal individual .
The 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor of S-LB1 was comparable to the well-characterized chick intestinal 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor in terms of its ligand binding affinity and capacity , its mobility on 5-20 % sucrose gradients , and its adsorption to and elution properties from DNA-cellulose .
Three cell lines established from patients with VDDR-II ( Rh-VDR , Sh-VDR , and Ab-VDR ) showed no specific binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to a receptor and treatment of the cultured cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 did not stimulate production of 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 ( 24,25(OH)2D3 ) , a response which is diagnostic of the presence of a functional 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor .
In a fourth cell line , A1-VDR , the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 had a low binding capacity and 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase activity was not detectable .
Induction of 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in the fifth cell line , designated Ro-VDR , although the sensitivity to hormone treatment was lower than in the control cell line from a normal donor .
The capacity of the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 was low in Ro-VDR .
In all cell lines where 1,25(OH)2D3 binding to a receptor was detectable , the receptor had the typical sedimentation coefficient of 3.7 S on sucrose density gradient analysis .
Binding and elution properties to DNA-cellulose , however , differed from normal in both Ro-VDR and A1-VDR cells where elution from DNA-cellulose occurred at a lower salt concentration than is typical of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor .
While Ro-VDR cells showed typical nuclear localization of the unoccupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor , neither the unoccupied nor the occupied receptor from A1-VDR cells was completely localized in the nucleus .
In a series of functional studies we found that modulation of the level of the mRNAs coding for both the c-myc oncogene and the growth factor known as granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating activity by 1,25(OH)2D3 correlated with the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor status of these cells .
Use of these cell lines will facilitate further study of the molecular defect ( s ) in the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitamin D-dependent rickets type II and will allow a correlation with impairment of cellular functions .
Using a monoclonal antibody , Lt-4 , directed against human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) trans-activator ( tax1 ) antigen , we examined the expression of tax1 and related antigens in a variety of T cell lines bearing HTLV-I and related retroviruses , simian T cell leukemia virus type I ( STLV-I ) and HTLV-II , by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays .
Lt-4 reacted with all HTLV-I-bearing cell lines tested and five out of eight simian cell lines bearing STLV-I , but not with an HTLV-II-bearing cell line .
Lt-4 detected 40 kd tax1 antigen molecules in most HTLV-I -bearing cell lines except one cell line that expressed 39 kd tax1 antigen .
In the STLV-I-bearing T cell lines , tax1-related antigen molecules detected by Lt-4 were heterogeneous , having molecular weights in the range of 36-41 kd .
The Epstein-Barr virus early antigen diffuse component ( EA-D ) is essential for Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase activity , and its activity is suppressed during latent infection .
We investigated the regulation of the promoter ( BMRF1 ) for this early gene by studying its responsiveness in vitro to two immediate-early viral transactivators , BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) , focusing on the differences in response in lymphoid cells and epithelial cells .
In lymphoid cells , Z or R alone produced only small increases in EA-D promoter activity , whereas both transactivators together produced a large stimulatory effect .
In epithelial cells , the Z transactivator alone produced maximal stimulation of the EA-D promoter ; the effect of R and Z together was no greater than that of Z alone .
Deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the EA-D promoter demonstrated that in epithelial cells the potential AP-1 binding site plays an essential role in Z responsiveness , although sequences further upstream are also important .
In lymphoid cells , only the upstream sequences are required for transactivation by the Z/R combination , and the AP-1 site is dispensable .
These data suggest that EA-D ( BMRF1 ) promoter regulation by Z and R is cell type specific and appears to involve different mechanisms in each cell type .
Inhibitory drug interactions affecting the metabolism of methylprednisolone ( MP ) may produce either steroid sparing or adverse effects partly by increasing the exposure time to the steroid .
This phenomenon can be mimicked by administering MP in divided doses .
Two types of responses were compared after a single MP dose ( 40 mg bolus ) and a divided regimen ( 20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later ) in six healthy male volunteers .
The suppression of basophils measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours .
The 37.5 % reduction in dose produced a 23 % overall decreased blood histamine response .
A pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of MP after both regimens .
A slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of basophil cell return to blood .
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP of about 5 ng/ml were similar for both regimens .
The decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between MP treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours .
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng/ml .
Pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the " dose-sparing " effects that were achieved by prolonging MP plasma concentrations .
This study supports previous clinical observations that patients may require morning through evening exposure to MP to optimize efficacy while adrenal suppression is being minimized .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( HIV-1-LTR ) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but not a T cell line .
This effect appears to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from NF-kappa B in U937 and THP-1 cells .
LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV-1 production from a chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line , U1 , which produces very low levels of HIV-1 at baseline .
The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) before treatment with LPS .
This stimulation of HIV-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of HIV-1 RNA and and activation of NF-kappa B .
LPS is not able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned T cell line .
The effect of LPS on HIV-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV-1 infection .
Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .
Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937 cell line ( U9-IIIB ) .
TNF-alpha RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9-IIIB cells .
Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of TNF-alpha RNA in U9-IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV-infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF-alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .
The effects of TNF-alpha on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and the beta interferon promoter .
In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF-alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF-kappa B-containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity .
Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF-alpha , multimers of the PRDII NF-kappa B-binding domain were inducible by both agents .
TNF-alpha was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells , but in monocytic cells , TNF-alpha did not induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity .
This level of NF-kappa B-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since TNF-alpha treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells .
However , in Jurkat cells , TNF-alpha dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV-1 through the cell population and increased viral RNA synthesis , indicating that in T cells HIV-1 multiplication was stimulated by TNF-alpha treatment .
We have cloned and characterized a mitogen-inducible gene isolated from human T cells that predicts a protein of 968 amino acids .
The amino-terminal domain has regions homologous to the oncogene rel and to the developmentally important gene dorsal of Drosophila .
The carboxy-terminal domain contains repeat structures found in a variety of proteins that are involved in cell-cycle control of yeast and in tissue differentiation in Drosophila and Ceanorhabditis elegans , as well as in the putative human oncogene bcl-3 and in the ankyrin protein .
A truncated form of the product of this gene translated in vitro is a DNA-binding protein which interacts specifically with the kappa B binding site found in many inducible genes , including the enhancer in human immunodeficiency virus .
This gene is yet another in a growing list of important regulatory molecules whose expression is transcriptionally induced upon cellular activation .
Several new 4,19-substituted steroids and previously synthesized corticosteroids were assayed for affinity to type 1 receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes .
11 beta,19-epoxy-4,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ( 2 ) was hydrogenated with Pd-C to yield a mixture of all four dihydro derivatives 5 , accompanied by 4,21-diacetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one ( 6 ) and 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-4-hydroxypregnane-3,20-dione ( 7 ) .
With hot acetic + p-toluenesulfonic acid 5 underwent rearrangement to 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxypregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 8 ) Pd-C hydrogenation of 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregna-2,9(11)-diene-4,20-dione ( 10 ) gave 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 11 ) and the 9,11-dihydro derivative of the latter .
Treatment of 10 with warm HCl furnished 19-chloro-4,21-dihydroxypregna-4,9(11)-diene-3,20-dione (13) .
Pd-C hydrogenation of its diacetate 14 afforded the 4,5-dihydro derivative 18, 19-chloro-21-acetoxypregn-9(11)-en-20-one ( 15 ) , its 4-acetoxy derivative 16 and the 3,4-diacetoxy derivative 17 .
When tested in a radioreceptor assay in human mononuclear leukocytes the synthesized compounds showed only low relative binding affinities ( RBA ) to type 1 receptor , the highest being 0.72 % for 13 ( aldosterone = 100 % ) .
For comparison , other RBA in this system were : 19-noraldosterone , 20 % ; 18-deoxyaldosterone , 5.8 % ; 18-deoxy-19-noraldosterone , 4.7 % ; 18,21-anhydroaldosterone , 0.37 % ; 17-isoaldosterone , 7.6 % and apoaldosterone , 4.3 %
This report is concerned with the prediction of natural killer ( NK ) cell activity in 61 Stage I and II breast cancer patients , between the ages of 25 and 70 , who were accrued to this project .
All baseline interview and testing data were obtained either just before patients were discharged from the hospital , or at their first outpatient visit , within two weeks of discharge .
A major interest of this project is the predictive value of perceived social support , as a potential " stress " buffer , related to NK activity .
In the main model reported here , we found that a significant amount of NK activity variance could be explained by five variables .
Higher NK activity could be predicted by the perception of high quality emotional support from a spouse or intimate other , perceived social support from the patient 's physician , estrogen receptor-negative tumor status , having an excisional biopsy as surgical treatment , and actively seeking social support as a major coping strategy ( R2 = 0.33 , F ( 5 , 55 ) = 5.5 , p less than 0.0004 ) .
Findings are discussed in terms of host interaction with tumor endocrine status , and the role that social support might play in modulating such activity .
Rex , the post-transcriptional regulator of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , is known to induce accumulation of the unspliced viral gag-pol mRNA .
Rex is a phosphoprotein found in the cell nucleolus , whose function may be regulated by its localization and phosphorylation .
We have examined the role of phosphorylation on Rex function by using a protein kinase inhibitor , H-7 [ 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine ] .
Treatment of an HTLV-I infected human T-cell line with H-7 blocked specifically accumulation of the unspliced gag-pol mRNA , resulting in the decreased Gag protein synthesis that corresponds with the decreased in vivo phosphorylation of Rex .
In contrast , other viral and cellular products have not been influenced by the level of H-7 used .
Therefore , the phosphorylation of Rex is required for the viral RNA partition of HTLV-I .
Human T-cell leukemia virus types I ( HTLV-I ) and II ( HTLV-II ) have two nonstructural trans-acting regulatory genes , tax and rex , located in the 3' region of the viral genome .
The tax gene product ( HTLV-I p40tax and HTLV-II p37tax ) is the transcriptional activator of the viral long terminal repeat .
The rex gene encodes two protein products , p27rex/p21rex and p26rex/p24rex in HTLV-I and HTLV-II , respectively .
Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length gag/pol and singly spliced env mRNA in the cytoplasm of HTLV-infected cells .
Previous studies showed that the first ATG of the rex gene is critical for Rex production and function .
The importance of the internal ATGs to Rex function is not known .
However , in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-I rex gene has provided indirect evidence which suggests that p21rex , and by analogy HTLV-II p24rex , results from initiation at an internal AUG of the tax/rex mRNA .
By using an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-II , we investigated the importance of the internal ATGs of the rex gene on Rex protein production and function .
Our results indicate that p24rex of HTLV-II is not initiated at an internal AUG and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the rex gene and , ultimately , the transforming properties of the virus .
The survival-promoting activity of the Bcl-2 family of proteins appears to be modulated by interactions between various cellular proteins .
We have identified a novel cellular protein , Bik , that interacts with the cellular survival-promoting proteins , Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , as well as the viral survival-promoting proteins , Epstein Barr virus-BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19 kDa .
In transient transfection assays , Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family , Bax and Bak .
This death-promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , EBV-BHRF1 and E1B-19 kDa proteins suggesting that Bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins .
While Bik does not show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl-2 family , it does share a 9 amino acid domain ( BH3 ) with Bax and Bak which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins .
Human cDNAs encoding Kruppel-type zinc finger domains , designated KOX 1-32 , have been cloned from human T lymphocyte cell line libraries .
We report here the regional localizations by in situ hybridization of KOX 18 and KOX 25 on chromosome bands 7q21q22 .
Pulse-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) analysis showed that these genes are physically located within a DNA fragment of 250 kb .
The genes KOX 4 and KOX 9 , mapped on chromosome 8q24 , were found to be located within a DNA fragment of 450 kb .
From the present and previous data , eighteen different KOX genes have been located at least two by two within nine DNA fragments of 200 to 580 kb .
In our attempt to identify chemokine receptors that are related to Burkitt 's lymphoma receptor 1 ( BLR1 ) and are expressed in activated lymphocytes we used RT-PCR resulting in the isolation of a cDNA encoding a seven transmembrane receptor termed BLR2 .
The protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of G-protein coupled chemokine receptors and turned out to be identical to the recently described receptor EBI1 .
Northern blot analysis revealed that BLR2 mRNA could be highly stimulated in mitogen- and anti-CD3-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes .
BLR2-specific mRNA could be detected in all Epstein-Barr virus positive B cell lines .
We show that transcription of the BLR2 gene could be specifically induced in Epstein-Barr virus negative BL 41 cells via estrogen-mediated activation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 , a key regulator of viral and cellular genes in immortalized B cells .
Our data suggest an involvement of BLR2 in the regulation of migration in activated lymphocytes and in viral pathogenesis .
The balance between type 1 and 2 T helper cell cytokine production plays an important role in several animal models of autoimmunity , and skewed patterns of cytokine expression have been described in human inflammatory diseases .
Many cytokines activate signal transducer and activation of transcription ( STAT ) transcription factors , which , in turn , activate transcription of inflammatory effector genes .
We used mononuclear cell priming cultures and inflammatory synovial fluids ( SFs ) derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of cytokine production and STAT activity by an inflammatory synovial microenvironment .
Exposure to SFs during priming resulted in an 81 % inhibition of interferon ( IFN ) -gamma , but not interleukin ( IL ) 4 , production by effector cells generated in priming cultures .
SF suppression was mediated by IL-4 and IL-10 and inhibition of IL-12 expression , and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by exogenous IL-12 .
SFs blocked the sustained activity of transcription factor Stat1 , but not Stat3 , during the priming period , and Stat1 activity was differentially regulated by cytokines in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of IFN-gamma production .
Active Stat3 , but not Stat1 , was detected in cells from inflamed joints .
These results suggest a role for altered balance of Stat1 and Stat3 transcriptional activity in the regulation of T cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory synovitis .
Tenascin ( TN ) is an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed widely in the fetus and sparingly in the adult , but reappears at high levels in certain areas of tissue insult such as tumor matrices and sites of wound healing .
We show here that soluble TN inhibits proliferation of human T cells in response to alpha CD3 Ab co-immobilized with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin ( FN ) .
TN also inhibits proliferation driven by alpha CD3/IL-2 or by phorbol ester/IL-2 , and it prevents high level induction of IL-2R .
The presence of TN in culture medium does not detectably alter the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from T cell triggering with alpha CD3 , but at later time points prevents the appearance of functional NF-AT1 transcription factor complexes in T cell nuclear extracts .
These findings are consistent with the postulated role for TN as a natural antagonist to FN action , and suggest that T cell responses occurring at tissue sites in which TN is expressed could be influenced by its presence .
Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to rapid and transient expression of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) .
When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS ( 1 microgram/ml ) , expression of the TNF gene is minimal , i.e. the cells are tolerant .
In nuclear run-on analysis , such tolerant cells show only a low degree of transcription , indicating that tolerance operates at or upstream of the transcription level .
The CD14 LPS receptor is , however , up-regulated ( not down-regulated ) in tolerant cells , and LPS can , in fact , still lead to activation of tolerant cells as evidenced by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Resolution of the NF-kappa B complex in gel shift analysis shows that the binding protein , mobilized in naive Mono Mac 6 cells , consists mainly of p50-p65 heterodimers , while in tolerant cells , the p50 homodimer is predominant .
This increase in p50 homodimers coincides with an increase in p105 mRNA , suggestive of a transcriptional up-regulation of p50 .
Reporter gene analysis reveals that the NF-kappa B complex mobilized in tolerant cells is functionally inactive in that NF-kappa B-dependent luciferase constructs containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat or the TNF 5'-region show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation .
Similar to Mono Mac 6 cells , primary blood monocytes , when precultured with a low dose of LPS , also become tolerant and produce little TNF after LPS stimulation .
The tolerant blood monocytes also up-regulate CD14 , and they mobilize NF-kappa B with a predominance of p50 homodimers .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that tolerance to LPS is determined by post-receptor mechanisms that involve an altered composition of the NF-kappa B complex .
We have identified and characterized a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia that shares features of both myeloid and natural killer ( NK ) cells .
From a consecutive series of 350 cases of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , we identified 20 cases ( 6 % ) with a unique immunophenotype : CD33+ , CD56+ , CD11a+ , CD13lo , CD15lo , CD34+/- , HLA-DR- , CD16- .
Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of myeloid ( CD33 , CD13 , CD15 ) and NK cell-associated ( CD56 ) antigens in each case , whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assays confirmed the identity of CD56 ( neural cell adhesion molecule ) in leukemic blasts .
Although two cases expressed CD4 , no case expressed CD2 , CD3 , or CD8 and no case showed clonal rearrangement of genes encoding the T-cell receptor ( TCR beta , gamma , delta ) .
Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features ( deeply invaginated nuclear membranes , scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity , and finely granular Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase cytochemical reactivity ) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; particularly the microgranular variant ( FAB AML-M3v ) .
However , all 20 cases lacked the t(15;17) and 17 cases tested lacked the promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) fusion transcript in RT-PCR assays ; 12 cases had 46,XX or 46,XY karyotypes , whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17q : 1 with del(17)(q25) and the other with t(11;17)(q23;q21) and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RAR alpha fusion transcript .
All cases tested ( 6/20 ) , including the case with t(11;17) , failed to differentiate in vitro in response to all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , suggesting that these cases may account for some APLs that have not shown a clinical response to ATRA .
Four of 6 cases tested showed functional NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity , suggesting a relationship between these unique CD33+ , CD56+ , CD16- acute leukemias and normal CD56+ , CD16- NK precursor cells .
Using a combination of panning and multiparameter flow cytometric sorting , we identified a normal CD56+ , CD33+ , CD16- counterpart cell at a frequency of 1 % to 2 % in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals .
Our studies suggest that this form of acute leukemia may arise from transformation of a precursor cell common to both the myeloid and NK cell lineages ; thus we propose the designation myeloid/NK acute leukemia .
Recognition of this new leukemic entity will be important in distinguishing these ATRA-nonresponsive cases from ATRA-responsive true APL .
Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) is due to induction of surface receptors , such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .
The antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) specifically inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Since kappa B motifs are present in VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) promoters , we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 induction and subsequent monocyte adhesion in TNF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .
PDTC or N-acetylcysteine dose dependently reduced TNF-induced VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1 surface protein ( also in human umbilical arterial endothelial cells ) and mRNA expression ( by 70 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) in HUVECs as assessed by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction .
Gel-shift analysis in HUVECs demonstrated that PDTC prevented NF-kappa B mobilization by TNF , suggesting that only VCAM-1 induction was controlled by NF-kappa B .
Since HUVECs released superoxide anions in response to TNF , and H2O2 induces VCAM-1 , PDTC may act as a radical scavenger .
Although ICAM-1 induction was unaffected , inhibitors of NADPH oxidase ( apocynin ) or cytochrome P-450 ( SKF525a ) suppressed VCAM-1 induction by TNF , revealing that several radical-generating systems are involved in its regulation .
PDTC , apocynin , or SKF525a decreased adhesion of monocytic U937 cells to TNF-treated HUVECs ( by 75 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) .
Inhibition by anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody 1G11 indicated that U937 adhesion was VCAM-1 dependent and suppression by antioxidants was due to reduced VCAM-1 induction .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Steel factor is one of the growth factors that controls the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and SCL , also known as Tcl-5 or Tal-1 , is a transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis .
In this report , we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells .
BFU-E-derived colonies increase progressively in size , as determined by cell number , from day 7 to day 14 of culture , with the greatest increase in colony size ( 10-fold expansion ) occurring between day 7 and day 10 .
SCL protein levels in BFU-E-derived cells were highest in day 7 cells and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture , suggesting an association of SCL with erythroid proliferation .
In contrast , SCL mRNA levels did not decrease significantly between day 7 and day 14 cells , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms are largely responsible for the decrease in SCL protein observed .
The role of SCL in Steel factor-induced erythroid proliferation was then examined .
In BFU-E-derived colonies cultured with Steel factor , colony size was significantly increased compared to control .
In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor , SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control .
The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation .
SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel .
The B cell-associated surface molecule CD40 functions to regulate B cell responses .
Cross-linking CD40 on B cells can lead to homotypic cell adhesion , IL-6 production , and , in combination with cytokines , to Ig isotype switching .
Tyrosine kinase activity is increased shortly after engagement of this receptor .
Little is known about how the very early events induced by CD40 cross-linking link to cellular responses .
In this study , we demonstrate that nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B and NF-kappa B-like transcription factors are activated after cross-linking CD40 on resting human tonsillar B cells and on B cell lines .
The activation is rapid and is mediated through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway .
The complexes detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays contain p50 , p65 ( RelA ) , c-Rel , and most likely other components .
By using transient transfection assays , we found that cross-linking CD40 supports NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression .
Our results define the NF-kappa B system as an intermediate event in CD40 signaling and suggest that the CD40 pathway can influence the expression of B cell-associated genes with NF-kappa B consensus sites .
1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20 % , respectively in monocytes .
2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes .
3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of ER gene to approximately 50 % in monocytes in a run-on assay .
4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene , which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes .
CD30 , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH-2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV ) -1 .
We demonstrate that cross-linking CD30 with an anti-CD30-specific monoclonal antibody , which mimics the described biological activities of the CD30 ligand ( CD30L ) , results in HIV expression .
CD30 cross-linking does not alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNF alpha/beta .
Furthermore , cross-linking of CD30 leads to NF-kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription .
Thus , CD30-CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B-dependent pathway that is independent of TNF .
This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4+ T cells , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor-ligand interactions .
Locus control regions ( LCRs ) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors .
A 2.3-kb LCR in the human adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) gene first intron , which controls expression in thymocytes , is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin .
Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements .
We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site .
In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells , c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences .
c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures .
Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression .
Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes .
Within the context of a complex enhancer and LCR , c-Myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site .
T-lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25(OH)2D3 ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA levels .
We report here that 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant , suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D3 receptor ( VDR ) .
We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter /reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding .
We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in vivo to a short 40-bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , NF-AT-1 , which is bound by a T-cell-specific transcription factor , NFATp , as well as by AP-1 .
VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress IL-2 expression .
These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression .
By combining partially purified proteins in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound NFATp /AP-1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor .
Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp /AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element .
This direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of transcriptional activators of the IL-2 gene may provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents .
Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I ( Fc gamma RI ) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma .
Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression .
Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma .
Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis , which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site without a TATA box .
Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site ( -7 to +13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element ( GIRE ) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site .
A 17-bp sequence between positions -51 and -35 conferred IFN-gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .
Double-stranded GIRE sequence , but not a scrambled sequence , was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma treated U937 cells .
Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells .
The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes .
Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter .
Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .
They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear .
Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in mice and cultured cells .
This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .
Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids .
We have examined binding of the nuclear protein HMG-I to the human gamma-globin promoter .
We find that HMG-I binds preferentially to the more 3' of a pair of GATA motifs in the gamma-globin promoter ; this paired motif is bound by the erythroid factor GATA-1 .
A naturally occurring mutation ( -175 T-C ) in the area bound by HMG-I results in overexpression of gamma-globin in adult red blood cells ( HPFH ) and up-regulation of the gamma-globin promoter in in vitro expression assays ; HMG-I does not bind to this mutant sequence .
A survey of GATA motifs from other globin cis-elements demonstrates HMG-I binding to most of them .
These findings implicate HMG-I in the HPFH phenotype ; we speculate that it may participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate globin gene expression .
The cell surface receptors for PRL and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) are structurally distinct , but share regulatory tasks in T lymphocytes .
They can stimulate proliferation and activate transcription of over-lapping sets of genes of T cells .
PRL and IL-2 receptor activation are both linked to the Jak/Stat ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway .
We investigated the ability of PRL and IL-2 to activate Stat proteins in different T cell lines .
The DNA binding specificities , the reactivities toward Stat-specific antisera , and the mol wt of IL-2- and PRL-induced DNA-binding proteins in Nb2 and C196 T cell lines were investigated .
A comparison with the Stat proteins induced by interferon-gamma , PRL , and IL-6 in T47D mammary tumor cells was made .
We found that these parameters were indistinguishable for one of the PRL- and IL-2-induced factors .
A transcription factor closely related to mammary gland factor-Stat5 is rapidly activated upon interaction of IL-2 and PRL with their respective receptors .
Activation of a second protein related to Stat1 was also observed .
Our results emphasize the role of PRL as a regulator of the immune response and indicate that the Stat factors mammary gland factor-Stat5 and Stat1 play a role in the regulation of gene expression during T cell development .
Oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , may represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies .
Oxidative stress enhances nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activity , and NF-kappa B activity has been shown to enhance the expression of cytotoxic cytokines .
Acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 in mice .
This injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water-soluble emulsion of alpha-tocopherol .
Alpha-tocopherol treatment of the mice given the CCl4 also reduced the NF-kappa B binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice .
In vitro treatment of a monocyte/macrophage cell line with CCl4 led to enhanced NF-kappa B binding and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) messenger RNA levels .
Liver specimens taken from patients with acute fulminant hepatitis had markedly increased NF-kappa B binding activity in comparison with the binding of normal livers .
These data demonstrate that abolishing acute hepatic injury with alpha-tocopherol , a free radical scavenger , also eliminated increased NF-kappa B binding .
It is tempting to speculate that enhanced NF-kappa B expression caused by free radical production/oxidative stress may modulate liver injury , perhaps through an effect on cytotoxic cytokine synthesis .
Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ) .
HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent growth ; over time , by an unknown mechanism , the cells become IL-2-independent .
Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL-2 , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells .
In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes , the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated Jak-STAT pathway , which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation .
This review focuses on the roles of transcription factors in hematopoietic lineage commitment .
A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify transcription factors important in specifying hematopoietic cell types .
Next is presented a discussion of the use of embryonic stem cells in the analysis of hematopoietic gene expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of transcription factors in hematopoiesis .
Finally , the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of transcription factors in the commitment to erythroid , myeloid and lymphoid cell types is summarized .
Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells .
Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad-infected targets .
The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells .
This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells suggests that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A-immortalized cells that may emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host .
Lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis , a response which may serve as a form of ' altruistic suicide ' to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion .
The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes , but an as yet unknown , p53-independent pathway ( s ) appears to mediate the same event in mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes .
Here we show DNA damage-induced apoptosis in these T lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) -1 .
Thus two different anti-onco-genic transcription factors , p53 and IRF-1 , are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes .
We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme ( ICE ) gene , a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3 , is IRF-1-dependent .
Ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis .
Hydroxyurea ( HU ) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation .
In addition , HU stimulates the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia patients .
To further understand its mechanism of action , we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of c-jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells .
HU induced a dose-dependent stimulation of c-jun synthesis .
The levels of c-jun mRNA was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by HU within 2 h .
This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h .
Both nuclear run-on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates c-jun mRNA expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c-jun mRNA .
In addition , the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in HU treated cells .
Furthermore , concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X AP-1/CAT activity .
These results strongly suggest that HU induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of c-jun during erythroid differentiation .
Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and cell proliferation .
In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression .
Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase .
Our data suggest that lipoxygenase metabolites activate ROI formation which then induce IL-2 expression via NF-kappa B activation .
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway .
Activation of CD4 positive T cells is a primary requirement for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) entry , efficient HIV replication , and progression to AIDS ,
Utilizing CD4 positive T cell lines and purified T cells from normal individuals , we have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV , gp 160 , can induce activation of transcription factor , activated protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .
The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule , since treatment of gp160 with soluble CD4-IgG abrogates its activity , and CD4 negative T cell lines fail to be stimulated with gp160 .
Immunoprecipitation of the gp 160-induced nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins indicates that AP-1 complex is comprised of members of these family of proteins .
The gp160-induced AP-1 complex is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation and is protein synthesis-independent .
This stimulation can also be abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase C , but it is unaffected by calcium channel blocker or cyclosporine A .
This gp160 treatment adversely affects the functional capabilities of T cells : pre-treatment of CD4+ T cells with gp160 for 4 h at 37 degrees C inhibited anti-CD3-induced interleukin-2 secretion .
Effects similar to gp160 were seen with anti-CD4 mAb .
The aberrant activation of AP-1 by gp160 in CD4 positive T cells could result in up-regulation of cytokines containing AP-1 sites , e.g. interleukin-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and concurrently lead to T cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting interleukin-2 secretion .
The ZEBRA protein has a unique biological function among herpesviral proteins .
It is responsible for the disruption of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latency and the induction of the lytic cycle .
ZEBRA is a bZIP transcriptional activator which binds as a dimer to 7-bp response elements within EBV promoters and is directly involved in the stimulation of virus replication at the EBV lytic origin .
We have employed the ZEBRA/EBV biological system to test whether a heterologous activation domain can substitute for another activation domain ( the ZEBRA domain ) .
The ZEBRA activation region was replaced with the potent acid activation region from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein or with the activation region of the EBV R protein .
Both chimeras were found to transactivate model and native promoters at equivalent or better levels than ZEBRA itself .
Activation was not target- or cell-type dependent , nor was it dependent on the presence of virus .
These activation domains restored ZEBRA 's ability to induce early antigen and to stimulate origin replication to levels that were equal to or greater than those of wild type .
These studies suggest that the specificities of some of the known biological functions of ZEBRA are not dependent upon the nature of the activation domain present within ZEBRA .
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) , the primary regulator of the production of erythroid cells , acts by binding to a cell surface receptor ( EpoR ) on erythroid progenitors .
We used deletion analysis and transfection assays with reporter gene constructs to examine the transcription control elements in the 5' flanking region of the human EpoR gene .
In erythroid cells most of the transcription activity was contained in a 150 bp promoter fragment with binding sites for transcription factors AP2 , Sp1 and the erythroid-specific GATA-1 .
The 150 bp hEpoR promoter exhibited high and low activity in erythroid OCIM1 and K562 cells , respectively , reflecting the high and low levels of constitutive hEpoR expression .
The GATA-1 and Sp1 binding sites in this promoter lacking a TATA sequence were necessary for a high level of transcription activation .
Protein-DNA binding studies suggested that Sp1 and two other CCGCCC binding proteins from erythroid and non-erythroid cells could bind to the Sp1 binding motif .
By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection , we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells , but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells , although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562 .
Interestingly , when we mutated the Sp1 site , resulting in a marked decrease in hEpoR promoter activity , we could restore transactivation by increasing GATA-1 levels in OCIM1 cells .
These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter , the level of hEpoR gene expression does not depend on GATA-1 alone .
Rather , hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA-1 with other cell-specific factors , including possibly other Sp1-like binding proteins , to provide high level , tissue-specific expression .
The mRNA for the Duffy blood group antigen , the erythrocyte receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed chemokine receptor .
Here , we show that the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene ( DARC ) is composed of a single exon and that most Duffy-negative blacks carry a silent FY*B allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -46 .
This mutation impairs the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor .
With the recent characterization of the FY*A and FY*B alleles , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid-specific repression of the DARC gene in Duffy-negative individuals .
The regulation of interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene expression has been investigated mainly in T lymphocytes , the predominant producers of IL-2 .
However , B cells can also synthesize IL-2 .
In the present study we analyzed the control of IL-2 promoter activity in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed B cell clones which are capable of secreting IL-2 at a low level after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin .
Transient transfections using reporter constructs with multiples of transcription factor binding sites from the IL-2 promoter [ distal nuclear factor ( NF ) -AT , proximal NF-AT , AP-1/Octamer ( UPS ) or NF-chi B ( TCEd ) sites ] were performed .
In EBV-transformed B clones , the chi B site exerted the strongest inducible activity ; the NF-AT binding sites showed either no or only weak activity compared to Jurkat T cells .
An IL-2 promoter bearing a defective NF-chi B site was completely inactive in EBV-transformed B cells , while it still had activity in Jurkat T cells .
In seven EBV-B cell clones or lines differing in their capacity to secrete IL-2 , the activity of the IL-2 promoter correlated well with the status of IL-2 secretion .
Similarly , a human immunodeficiency virus promoter , whose activity is controlled through chi B factors , was found to be active in the IL-2 producing EBV-B cells , but inactive in the non-IL-2-producing cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from EBV-B cells and the IL-2 NF-chi B probe revealed the constitutive generation of chi B complexes in IL-2-secreting cells consisting mainly of heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes .
A weaker chi B complex formation and faster-migrating complexes were detected in non-IL-2-secreting cells .
These results demonstrate that the IL-2 NF-chi B site is indispensable for the activity of the IL-2 promoter in EBV-transformed B cells , whereas other transcription factors appear to be less important for IL-2 expression in these cells .
The human activation antigen CD69 is a member of the C-type animal lectin superfamily that functions as a signal-transmitting receptor .
Although the expression of CD69 can be induced in vitro on cells of most hematopoietic lineages with a wide variety of stimuli , in vivo it is mainly expressed by T-lymphocytes located in the inflammatory infiltrates of several human diseases .
To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the constitutive and inducible expression of CD69 by leukocytes , we isolated the promoter region of the CD69 gene and carried out its functional characterization .
Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the CD69 gene revealed the presence of a potential TATA element 30 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site and several putative binding sequences for inducible transcription factors ( NF-kappa B , Egr-1 , AP-1 ) , which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene .
Transient expression of CD69 promoter-based reporter gene constructs in K562 cells indicated that the proximal promoter region spanning positions -78 to +16 contained the cis-acting sequences necessary for basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible transcription of the CD69 gene .
Removal of the upstream sequences located between positions -78 and -38 resulted in decreased promoter strength and abolished the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
We also found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) is capable of inducing the surface expression of the CD69 molecule as well as the promoter activity of fusion plasmids that contain 5'-flanking sequences of the CD69 gene , suggesting that this cytokine may regulate in vivo the expression of CD69 .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
PU.1 is a hematopoietic transcription factor belonging to the Ets-family .
It is identical to the Spi-1 oncogene , which is implicated in spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine erythroleukemias .
PU.1 seems to be required for early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages , but its expression in mature cells is preferentially observed in cells of the B-cell-and monocyte/macrophage-differentiation lineage .
It binds the so-called Pu box , an important tissue-specific regulatory DNA element present in a number of genes expressed in these cell lineages .
We have analyzed the expression and activity of PU.1 during human B-cell development using a panel of B-cell lines representing different stages of maturation , from early precursors to differentiated plasma cells .
PU.1 mRNA expression and PU.1 DNA binding activity , as measured by Northern blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , were evident in cell lines representing pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells .
We could also show Pu box-dependent transactivation of a reporter gene in transient transfections in these cell lines .
In contrast , in a number of multiple myeloma cell lines , representing differentiated , plasma cell-like B cells , PU.1 DNA binding activity , mRNA expression , and Pu box-dependent transactivation were absent or detectable at a very low level .
In lymphoblastoid cell lines , which exemplify an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation , a reduced expression and activity were observed .
The findings in the human multiple myeloma cell lines represent the first examples of B cells with downregulated PU.1 expression and apparently contradict observations in the murine system in which PU.1 is expressed and active in plasmacytoma cell lines .
At present , it is unclear whether the lack of PU.1 expression and activity in human multiple myeloma cell lines represents a malignancy-associated defect in these cells or exemplifies a normal developmental regulation in terminally differentiated B cells .
The genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol-VDR complex , the role of microtubules in the response to 1,25(OH)2D3 has not been studied in viable cells .
Our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .
Monocytes convert 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25(OH)2D3 .
Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity , without affecting either total 1,25(OH)2D3 uptake or maximal 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR binding .
Thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent modulation of gene transcription .
Interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis , not by decreasing the Vmax of monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase but through an increase in the Km for 25(OH)2D3 .
We examined 25(OH)D3 transport .
Microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25(OH)D3 uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .
Thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25(OH)D3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis .
Activation of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene after antigen recognition is a critical event for T cell proliferation and effector function .
Prior studies have identified several transcription factors that contribute to the activity of the IL-2 promoter in stimulated T lymphocytes .
Here we describe a novel regulatory element within the IL-2 promoter located immediately upstream of the nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) domain .
This region ( termed the zinc finger protein binding region ( ZIP ) ) serves as binding site for two differently regulated zinc finger proteins : the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 and the inducible early growth response protein EGR-1 .
In unstimulated cells which do not secrete IL-2 , only Sp1 binds to this region , while in stimulated IL-2 secreting cells the inducible EGR-1 protein recognizes this element .
In Jurkat T cells , the ZIP site serves as an activator for IL-2 gene expression , and a combination of ZIP and NFAT binding sites is required for maximal IL-2 promoter activity .
These results suggest a critical role of the ZIP site for IL-2 promoter activity .
We have isolated cDNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response ( MyD ) genes , activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis following induction for differentiation along either the macrophage or granulocyte lineage in human myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells .
One cDNA clone of a primary response gene , expressed upon macrophage differentiation , encoded for Egr-1 , a zinc finger transcription factor .
The Egr-1 gene was observed to be transcriptionally silent in HL-60 cells , but active in U-937 and M1 cells , the latter two being predetermined for macrophage differentiation .
Egr-1 antisense oligomers in the culture media blocked macrophage differentiation in both myeloid leukemia cell lines and normal myeloblasts .
HL-60 cells constitutively expressing an Egr-1 transgene ( HL-60Egr-1 ) could be induced for macrophage , but not granulocyte , differentiation .
These observations indicate that expression of Egr-1 is essential for and restricts differentiation of myeloblasts along the macrophage lineage .
Monocyte-macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) .
We examined mRNA levels of various V-ATPase subunits during differentiation of both native monocytes and the cell line THP-1 , and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell V-ATPase content .
From nuclear runoff experiments , we found that one subunit in particular , the B2 isoform ( Mr = 56,000 ) , was amplified primarily by transcriptional means .
We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region .
Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5'-flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA-less promoter with a high G + C content .
Primer extension and ribonuclease protection analyses indicate a single major transcriptional start site .
We transfected promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into THP-1 cells to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation .
We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP-1 differentiation .
DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple AP2 and Sp1 binding sites in the 5'-untranslated and proximal coding regions .
Glucocorticoids are among the most potent antiinflammatory agents that can be used in the treatment of rhinitis .
Their mechanisms of action are multiple and complex and a number of reports describe significant systemic effects of locally administered glucocorticoids .
In order to evaluate the short-term systemic effects of intranasally administered glucocorticoids , 14 normal healthy subjects were treated with two doses of either budesonide ( BUD ) or fluticasone propionate ( FP ) for 2 weeks .
Before treatment , at regular intervals during the treatment , 1 week and finally 6 weeks after termination of treatment , the effects on glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and methallothionein ( MTIIa ) mRNA expression levels were examined in peripheral lymphocytes using a solution hybridization assay .
Serum cortisol , osteocalcin and urinary cortisol levels were also determined .
An insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) was performed at the end of the second week of treatment and at the end of the 6-week washout period with no statistically significant change in cortisol response .
In peripheral lymphocytes , GR mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated .
MTIIa mRNA levels increased significantly .
Serum osteocalcin decreased significantly during treatment with both BUD and FP .
Serum cortisol decreased after 1 week of treatment whereas urinary cortisol was not affected until the second week of treatment .
In conclusion , intranasal glucocorticoids at clinically recommended doses have not only significant systemic effects on adrenal function , but also have an effect on specific gene expression in peripheral lymphocytes .
These effects are receptor-dependent , reversible , and according to serum and urinary cortisol levels and ITT , leave the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function intact .
Finally , these short-term systemic effects were not associated with any of the noticeable side-effects usually observed during long-term treatment with glucocorticoids .
Core binding factor ( CBF ) , also known as polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 and SL3 enhancer factor 1 , is a mammalian transcription factor that binds to an element termed the core within the enhancers of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses .
The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes .
CBF consists of two subunits , a DNA binding subunit , CBF alpha , and a second subunit , CBF beta , that stimulates the DNA binding activity of CBF alpha .
One of the genes that encodes a CBF alpha subunit is AML1 , also called Cbf alpha 2 .
This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias .
An exogenously expressed Cbf alpha 2-encoded subunit ( CBF alpha 2-451 ) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and HeLa cells .
Activity was mediated through the core elements .
Three different isoforms of CBF beta were also tested for transcriptional activity on the SL3 enhancer .
The longest form , CBF beta-187 , increased the transcriptional stimulation by CBF alpha 2-451 twofold in HeLa cells , although it had no effect in P19 cells .
Transcriptional activation by CBF beta required binding to the CBF alpha subunit , as a form of CBF beta that lacked binding ability , CBF beta-148 , failed to increase activity .
These results indicated that at least in certain cell types , the maximum activity of CBF required both subunits .
They also provided support for the hypothesis that CBF is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores .
We also examined whether CBF could distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus , Akv .
This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of SL3 .
However , no combination of CBF alpha and CBF beta subunits that we tested was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays .
Thus , a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated .
A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL-2 .
Following T cell activation , the genes encoding IL-2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced .
In turn , secreted IL-2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes .
Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by IL-2 .
Following this lead , we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL-2 .
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL-2-inducible DNA binding activities .
Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line , termed YT .
We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL-2-inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin-induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue .
We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated hStat5 , helps govern the biological effects of IL-2 during the immune response .
Aspirin-like drugs ( ALD ) induce calcium mobilization , an essential component of T cell activation , but do not induce the biosynthesis of IL-2 .
To understand the extent to which ALD may mimic mitogenic stimulation , we studied cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling steps in ALD-treated T cells .
We found that ALD induce a transient activation of protein kinase ( PKC ) but have no effect ( in comparison to anti-CD3 antibodies ) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation .
ALD-induced calcium mobilization and PKC activation are independent of tyrosine protein kinase activity as shown by the lack of effect of herbimycin , a tyrosine-protein kinase-specific inhibitor .
Although we detected no IL-2 mRNA in ALD-treated cells , the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three regulatory sequences in the IL-2 promoter region : NFAT , NF kappa B , and AP-1 .
These binding activities are expressed only in activated T cells .
The expression of AP-1 depended on calcium mobilization and PKC activation .
These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD .
The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA-binding activity by several transcription factors .
However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation .
Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha-like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS-40 .
Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that HS-40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner .
We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS-40 by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures .
Three of these HS-40 enhancer motifs , 5'NF-E2/AP1 , GT II , and GATA-1(c) , positively regulate the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha-globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells .
On the other hand , the 3'NF-E2/AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor .
Mutation in the GATA-1(d) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS-40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells .
These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS-40 motifs .
The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of human alpha-like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo .
We have shown that interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and IL-2 control IL-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene transcription in CD4-CD8- murine T lymphocyte precursors .
Here we map the cis-acting elements that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the mouse IL-2R alpha gene using a thymic lymphoma-derived hybridoma ( PC60 ) .
The transcriptional response of the IL-2R alpha gene to stimulation by IL-1 + IL-2 is biphasic .
IL-1 induces a rapid , protein synthesis-independent appearance of IL-2R alpha mRNA that is blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation .
It also primes cells to become IL-2 responsive and thereby prepares the second phase , in which IL-2 induces a 100-fold further increase in IL-2R alpha transcripts .
Transient transfection experiments show that several elements in the promoter-proximal region of the IL-2R alpha gene contribute to IL-1 responsiveness , most importantly an NF-kappa B site conserved in the human and mouse gene .
IL-2 responsiveness , on the other hand , depends on a 78-nucleotide segment 1.3 kilobases upstream of the major transcription start site .
This segment functions as an IL-2-inducible enhancer and lies within a region that becomes DNase I hypersensitive in normal T cells in which IL-2R alpha expression has been induced .
IL-2 responsiveness requires three distinct elements within the enhancer .
Two of these are potential binding sites for STAT proteins .
The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth .
The nuclear activity of NF-kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha .
This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF-kappa B-inducing agents , including T-cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .
To explore these I kappa B alpha-dependent mechanisms for NF-kappa B induction , we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes .
Specifically , removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm .
However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells .
Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction , including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors .
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect , a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Together , these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in I kappa B alpha that coordinately controls the biologic activities of I kappa B alpha and NF-kappa B in response to viral and immune stimuli .
Activation of the TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers .
TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical-induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation .
Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) , we investigated whether the expression or activity of the TAL1 gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells ) .
Epo elicited a rapid , dose-related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs .
An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein .
Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein .
These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages .
The IE2 gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few viral regulatory proteins expressed immediately upon infection of the host cell .
It is a potent transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters .
We found that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product ( Rb ) dramatically suppressed this IE2 transactivation of various promoters .
However , unlike another tumor suppressor protein , p53 , Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , suggesting that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 rather than other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery .
We found by protein-affinity chromatography that Rb in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to IE2 .
Our results suggest that Rb may regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population .
Furthermore , these data may provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the possible involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis .
Using a modified sperm typing protocol , the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) .
Among 258 X chromosome-containing sperm , 19 % had a repeat number equal to the donor 's somatic DNA ( 47 repeats ) , 66 % were expansions and 15 % were contractions .
The average expansion was 2.7 repeats .
More than half of the expansions involved one or two repeats ; the largest was 11 repeats .
68 % of the contractions were also one or two repeats but six ( 16 % ) were very large ( 12-25 repeats ) .
One contraction generated an allele in an intermediate size range ( 33-39 repeats ) .
Such alleles have not been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X-chromosomes that have been examined .
Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions .
The inert quality of MRL-Ipr/Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4-CD8- ( CD4-8- ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL-2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation .
Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR-mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium .
They also display constitutively high levels of p59fyn and CD3 zeta tyrosine phosphorylation .
The generation of second messengers in T cells normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene .
We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL-2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4-8- T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes .
Levels of the octamer , NF-kappa B ( p50-p65 heterodimer ) , and AP-1 transcriptional factors are constitutively elevated in freshly isolated Ipr CD4-8- T cells , consistent with the activated phenotype of these cells .
Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
Yet , the levels of the activating NF-AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells .
Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4-8- T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF-AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes .
Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF-AT-binding factor is rapidly down-regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
These two abnormalities at the NF-AT site provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in IL-2 production from Ipr CD4-8- T cells .
Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 alpha ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 , LD78 , or AT464 ) are members of the -C-C family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .
Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow-derived MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation .
It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in mature cell types .
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 .
Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK-1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter .
One member , ICK-1A , behaves as a strong negative regulator .
In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , we show that the ICK-1 binding site does not confer negative regulation in U937 cells .
We provide evidence for an additional binding site , the MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) site , which overlaps the ICK-1 site .
Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .
A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .
We propose that the MNP protein ( s ) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor ( s ) expressed in hematopoietic cells .
We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
The PuF site on the silent normal c-myc allele was unoccupied .
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site .
Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site .
Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele ; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
Immunosuppression has been often associated with the course of malignant diseases .
In the present study , the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I-III breast cancer .
Whereas PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer preoperatively was significantly decreased when compared with data obtained in healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) , the degree of the defect in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs depended upon the tumour burden as manifested by tumour size and axillary lymph node involvement ( P < 0.003 in each case ) .
PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs dropped significantly in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) after an observation period of 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) , but not in patients under adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen only .
After an additional 6 months ( i.e. 12 months after surgery ) , PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0.1 ) , but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001 ) .
When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared , it was found that out of 23 patients whose PBMCs had experienced a drop in their PHA-induced proliferation , 14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( i.e. 36 months after surgery ) .
In contrast , out of 59 patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in their PHA-induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery , only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression .
We thus conclude that PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer depends upon the tumour load and is a good clinical predictor for the further course of the disease .
HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , decreased plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations and decreased intracellular glutathione levels .
We now show that a depletion of intracellular glutathione in a human T cell line ( Molt-4 ) inhibits the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas incubation with increasing extracellular concentrations of cysteine inhibits the DNA-binding and transactivating activity of NF kappa B .
Because inhibition of DNA-binding activity is associated with increasing intracellular glutathione disulfide levels and GSSG can be shown to inhibit the DNA-binding activity directly in cell-free systems , our studies suggest that GSSG is a physiologically relevant inhibitor in intact cells also .
NF kappa B controls many immunologically important genes , so our studies suggest that the immune system may be sensitive not only against a cysteine and glutathione deficiency but also against an excess of cysteine .
Estrogen exhibits a variety of actions , including immuno-modulatory effects , in vivo and in vitro .
The mechanism by which estrogen exerts its anti-inflammatory effect is not yet understood .
We investigated the possible mechanisms of estradiol acting via the polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , which are important in the immune response .
The agent , 17 beta-estradiol , but not 17 alpha-estradiol , significantly reduced PMNs chemotaxis to FMLP in a dose-dependent manner ( control vs estrogen 10(-10)-(-6) M , P < 0.05 ) .
Physiological concentrations of estradiol significantly reduced the chemotaxis of PMNs ( 10(-10) mol ) .
Pre-incubation with clomiphene or tamoxifen which are estrogen receptor antagonists , eliminated the inhibitory effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the chemotaxis of PMNs , restoring it to the control level .
These observations suggest that 17 beta-estradiol suppressed the chemotaxis of PMNs by a receptor-dependent mechanism .
In addition , the level of estradiol in human plasma , which PMNs were drawn , showed a close , inverse correlation with the PMNs chemotaxis to FMLP ( r = -0.821 p < 0.001 ) .
Estrogen may modify the activity of neutrophils during the normal menstrual cycle , not only during pregnancy , and influence inflammation .
The human platelet-activating factor receptor ( PAFR ) gene is transcribed by two distinct promoters ( promoter 1 and promoter 2 ) to generate two transcripts ( designated as PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 ) , though their open reading frames are identical .
By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts , we found that the levels of PAFR transcript 1 ( leukocyte-type ) , but not PAFR transcript 2 ( tissue-type ) , are upregulated by PAF as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) in the human stomach cancer cell line ( JR-St cells ) which expresses both functional PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 endogenously .
Functional analysis of the promoter 1 with a transient expression assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene as a reporter showed that both PAF and TPA activated the promoter 1 but not the deleted promoter lacking the three consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B located from -571 bp to -459 bp .
These findings suggest a molecular mechanism of positive regulation of PAFR gene expression by PAF through NF-kappa B , possibly by a phosphorylation reaction involving protein kinase C by PAF .
The regulation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activation by the T cell receptor ( TcR ) /CD3 complex in primary human T cells has been studied at various times after activation .
Only p50 NF-kappa B protein bound the kappa B element of interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain promoter on resting T cells .
However , immediately after TcR/CD3 cross-linking ( after approximately 1 h ; immediate ) binding of p50.p65 heterodimers was observed .
p50.c-rel heterodimers were also detected bound to this sequence at early time points ( 7-16 h ; early ) , and both remained active at later time points ( 40 h ; late ) after activation .
This regulation takes place mainly at the level of nuclear translocation of p65 and c-rel , at immediate and early time points .
Activation also induced c-rel and p105/p50 mRNA synthesis , but not p65 mRNA whose expression was constitutive .
Interestingly , all those early and late events , but not the immediate ones , were inhibited by a neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) monoclonal antibody .
Similarly , cycloheximide prevented the p65 and c-rel translocation and consequent formation of active binding heterodimers , at early and late times .
Cyclosporin A impaired not only early and late , but also immediate events ; however , addition of TNF-alpha prevented all inhibition .
These results indicate that the regulation of NF-kappa B activation during T cell activation by TcR/CD3 signals is biphasic : TcR/CD3 triggers its immediate translocation , which is transient if no TNF-alpha is present .
TNF-alpha , therefore , emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of NF-kappa B regulation , controlling both translocation of p65 and c-rel , and new mRNA synthesis for c-rel and p105/p50 .
Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this may be through the modulation of transcription factor binding to DNA .
The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .
TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased AP-1 and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased CREB binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course .
Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .
These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , not to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors .
This suggests that in these cells GR within the nucleus interacts with cytokine-stimulated transcription factors by the process of cross coupling .
This may be an important molecular site of steroid action .
To study the complexity and structural characteristics of zinc finger proteins expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a consensus zinc finger peptide domain was used to isolate 63 cDNA clones for Kruppel-related zinc finger genes from the human monoblast cell line U-937 .
By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these cDNA clones were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( HZF 1-42 ) of which only 8 have previously been described .
Northern blot analysis showed that a majority of these genes were expressed at comparable levels in U-937 and HeLa cells .
The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non-cell-type-specific expression suggest that the majority of the Kruppel-related zinc finger genes are likely to be expressed in most human tissues .
In contrast , some of the genes displayed a restricted expression pattern , indicating that they represent potential regulators of monocyte differentiation or proliferation .
Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 cDNAs ( HZF 1-10 ) and a partial characterization of HZF 11-42 revealed that a common feature of human Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins is the presence of tandem arrays of zinc fingers ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the carboxy-terminal regions of the proteins .
In addition , several novel KRAB-containing zinc finger genes and a novel conserved sequence element were identified .
Nef of primate lentiviruses is required for viremia and progression to AIDS in monkeys .
Negative , positive , and no effects of Nef have also been reported on viral replication in cells .
To reconcile these observations , we expressed a hybrid CD8-Nef protein in Jurkat cells .
Two opposite phenotypes were found , which depended on the intracellular localization of Nef .
Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface , the chimera inhibited or activated early signaling events from the T cell antigen receptor .
Activated Jurkat cells died by apoptosis , and only cells with mutated nef genes expressing truncated Nefs survived , which rendered Nef nonfunctional .
These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro .
Not only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation , but they also explain effects of Nef in HIV infection and progression to AIDS .
Present evidence indicates a pathway of signal transmission in T cells that is outlined in figure 1 .
The elevation in intracellular calcium that is induced by interactions at the antigen receptor leads to the activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin .
This in turn leads to the nuclear association of the cytosolic component of NF-ATc .
The activation of calcineurin and the nuclear import of NF-ATc can both be blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 in complex with their respective immunophilins .
Once in the nucleus , NF-ATc interacts with NF-ATn to form an active transcriptional complex .
NF-ATn is a ubiquitous protein , can be synthesized in response to PMA , and has many similarities to AP-1 .
The mechanism by which NF-ATc enters the nucleus is unknown , and although it appears to require calcineurin , NF-ATc has not yet been shown to be an in vivo substrate of calcineurin .
Alternative mechanisms include the possibility that NF-ATc operates on some cytoplasmic anchor or that other proteins that are controlled by calcineurin carry out the nuclear import of NF-ATc .
Although NF-ATp copurifies with NF-ATc , there is as yet no understanding of how NF-ATp is functioning in vivo .
Now that these proteins are purified and cloned , the major goals will be to understand their role and the roles of other family members in thymic development .
A DNA response element ( TR2RE-SV40 ) for the TR2 orphan receptor , a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) +55 region ( nucleotide numbers 368-389 , 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3' ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence .
DNA-swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE-SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the androgen receptor .
In addition , this TR2RE-SV40 can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters .
Together , these data suggest the TR2RE-SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression .
The expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in our earlier reports .
The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia .
Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro , while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA .
Cells originating from cases of Burkitt 's lymphoma were negative .
By contrast , three lymphoblastoid cell lines ( immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus ) were weakly positive and MNDA was up-regulated by interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) treatment .
As we reported previously , MNDA mRNA level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN-alpha ; in this study , we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages .
Three additional agents ( endotoxin , phytohemagglutinin , and phorbol ester ) and other conditions that affect function , cytokine production , differentiation , and/or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression .
The results varied with the agent , cell type , and stage of differentiation .
Changes in MNDA expression occurred slowly ( hours to days ) , suggesting that MNDA could mediate changes realized over a long period .
The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and mRNA indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point .
Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages .
The effects of interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) and interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on cellular functions were shown to be quite similar .
We provide evidence that in monocytes as well as in T lymphocytes both IL-4 and IL-13 activate the same recently identified transcription factor NF-IL4 which binds to the specific responsive element IL-4RE .
In addition , we show that a nuclear factor activated by interferon-gamma also interacts with the IL-4RE .
It differs from NF-IL4 in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex with DNA , in its DNA-binding specificity and in the proteins interacting with the DNA sequence .
Sensitivity against various enzyme inhibitors suggests that components of the signal transduction pathway are shared by all three cytokines .
Cytokine dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection has been documented in numerous studies and has been cited as an important component in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection .
Pharmacological modification of cytokine dysregulation , therefore , has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection .
Dr. Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital ( Boston ) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , a cytokine known to influence HIV-1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus .
Pentoxifylline , a trisubstituted xanthine derivative , has been used to decrease blood viscosity and is reasonably well tolerated by most recipients of the drug .
Results of preliminary studies , many of which were conducted by Dr. Dezube , suggest that use of this agent in combination with antiretroviral compounds may prove useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection .
A novel human homeobox gene , HB9 , was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from in vitro stimulated human tonsil B lymphocytes and from a human genomic library .
The HB9 gene is composed of 3 exons spread over 6 kilobases of DNA .
An open reading frame of 1206 nucleotides is in frame with a diverged homeodomain .
The predicted HB9 protein has a molecular mass of 41 kilodaltons and is enriched for alanine , glycine , and leucine .
The HB9 homeodomain is most similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster homeobox gene proboscipedia .
Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA purified from the human B cell line RPMI 8226 and from activated T cells revealed a major mRNA transcript of 2.2 kilobases .
Similar analysis of poly(A) RNA from a variety of adult tissues demonstrated HB9 transcripts in pancreas , small intestine , and colon .
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine HB9 RNA transcripts in hematopoietic cell lines .
HB9 RNA transcripts were most prevalent in several human B cell lines and K562 cells .
In addition , transcripts were detected in RNA prepared from tonsil B cells and in situ hybridization studies localized them in the germinal center region of adult tonsil .
These findings suggest the involvement of HB9 in regulating gene transcription in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues .
Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .
We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity .
The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .
On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B/Rel family proteins , the kappa B-binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit .
The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex , was not induced in the nucleus following activation .
Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells .
The altered kappa B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli .
RJ 2.2.5 is a human B cell mutant derived from the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function .
This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .
Here we show , by in vivo DNase I footprinting , that the AIR-1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy .
Interestingly , reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern .
DRA promoter occupancy in other class II-negative B cell lines , derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome , is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2.2.5 and Raji cells .
Moreover , the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients ' cell lines do not display a completely " bare promoter " as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent .
Thus , the use of DNase I allowed us , for the first time , to correlate the AIR-1 locus defect with class II promoter occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct MHC class II-negative cells .
The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) expression and nuclear factor ( NF ) activation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) in resting T cells , has been studied .
Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2R alpha and the activation of NF.kappa B .
This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF.kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus , where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL-2R alpha promoter either as p50.p65 or as p50.c-Rel heterodimers .
Interestingly , all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , as they were strongly inhibited by a neutralizing anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody .
Furthermore , cyclosporin A , which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC , strongly inhibited IL-2R alpha and NF.kappa B activation .
The addition of either TNF alpha or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R alpha inhibition , but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF.kappa B activation .
Those results indicate that , in resting T cells , PKC activation has only a triggering role , whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2R alpha chain or NF.kappa B activation .
The tal-1 gene , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis .
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or without tal-1 rearrangements .
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus .
Methylation studies indicated that the tal-15 ' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines .
Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal-1 locus .
HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .
HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line .
HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T-cell line that bears a t (1;14) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4 .
These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters .
The tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells , in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis .
Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone , via a calcineurin-dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A .
We have previously identified a promoter element , kappa 3 , that is required for calcium-stimulated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells .
Here , we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp , a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription .
NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element , and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction .
Thus , although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites , it appears to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp .
The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation .
Murine B lymphocytes , adipocytes , and olfactory neurons contain a DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of genes encoding tissue-specific components of signal transduction .
Purification and cloning of this protein , termed early B-cell factor ( EBF ) , from murine B lymphocytes and independent cloning of a protein , termed Olf-1 , from olfactory neuronal cells revealed virtual complete amino acid sequence identity between these proteins .
As a first step towards identifying a human genetic disorder or mouse mutation for which EBF could be a candidate gene , we have chromosomally mapped the corresponding locus in both species .
By Southern hybridization analyses of somatic cell hybrid panels with murine cDNA probe , fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of human genomic clones , and analysis of recombinant inbred mouse strains , we have found single sites for EBF homologous sequences on human Chromosome ( Chr ) 5 , band q34 , and on proximal mouse Chr 11 , in an evolutionarily conserved region .
The interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) gene is both an immediate-early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes .
To understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1 , we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter .
Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells , 1.7 kilobases ( kb ) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene mediated a 30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation .
Deletion mutants containing 1.3 , 0.6 , and 0.2 kb 5'-flanking DNA were incrementally less transcriptionally active , although 0.2 kb still mediated a 12-fold induction by PRL .
The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter failed to respond to PRL stimulation , suggesting that the activity of upstream PRL response elements may require an interaction with promoter-proximal elements .
By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24-h PRL induction time course , we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and promoter DNA .
The 0.2-kb IRF-CAT construct was induced by PRL stimulation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
In contrast , the 1.7-kb IRF-CAT construct was inducible by PRL during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle .
Hence , the PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene appears to be controlled by separate PRL-responsive elements : elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1 promoter region act during early activation , and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression .
A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division .
By contrast , many studies have reported that mitogen activation of T cells increases cAMP levels , implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process .
In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces nuclear factors that form complexes with cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) .
Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , two of which are induced by mitogen activation .
All four complexes contain CREB and are bound to the cAMP response element ( CRE ) core sequence ( TGACGTCA ) , as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments .
Binding of the four complexes to CRE is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or endogenous kinases .
Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells .
Mitogen induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of CREB .
Rather , the data indicate that mitogen increases the levels of a nuclear factor ( s ) that dimerizes with CREB .
Induction of new CREB complexes implies a physiological role for cAMP in mitogen activation of T lymphocytes .
Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is an important lymphokine required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation .
The IL-2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in CD4+ T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation .
Several cis-acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL-2 gene after stimulation .
In this study , we have analysed the function of these cis-acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL-2 enhancer and promoter sequence .
The results of this study suggest that the NFAT ( -276 to -261 ) , the distal octamer ( -256 to -248 ) and the proximal octamer ( -75 to -66 ) sites not only act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL-2 gene expression in resting cells .
Two other sites display disparate effects on IL-2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines : the distal purine box ( -291 to -277 ) and the proximal purine box sites ( -145 to -128 ) .
Finally , the AP-1 ( -186 to -176 ) and the kappa B sites ( -206 to -195 ) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells .
The AP-1 site mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the kappa B site responded to IL-1 stimulation .
These data suggest that the regulation of IL-2 gene expression is a complex process and multiple cis-acting regulatory sites interact to exert different effects in T cells representative of alternative stages of differentiation .
The induction of the AP-1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation .
We have examined the possibility that stimulation of phospholipase D ( PLD ) may regulate activation of transcription factor AP-1 in human T cells by transfecting human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells with a plasmid containing an AP-1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
We have detected activatable PLD in Jurkat cells , and we have found that addition of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the physiologic product of PLD action on phospholipids , is rapidly incorporated into Jurkat cells and leads to activation of transcription factor AP-1 .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 mAb activated both PLD and transcription factor AP-1 .
Wortmannin , an inhibitor of receptor-coupled PLD activation , blocked the anti-CD3-induced increases in both PLD activity and AP-1 enhancer activity .
We found a good correlation in the transfected cells between PLD activation and induction of AP-1 enhancer activity under different experimental conditions .
Furthermore , ethanol , an inhibitor of the PLD pathway , blocked the anti-CD3-stimulated AP-1 enhancer activity .
However , this anti-CD3-mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis .
The increases in AP-1 enhancer activity induced by PA or anti-CD3 mAb were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol , an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C ( PKC ) .
Furthermore , the PA- and the anti-CD3-induced increases in AP-1 enhancer activity were blocked by the presence of PKC inhibitors or by PKC down-regulation .
These data indicate that PLD stimulation can activate the transcription factor AP-1 in T lymphocytes , and suggest that the induction of AP-1 enhancer factor activity by PA is mediated via PKC stimulation , either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA-derived diacylglycerol formation .
These data also provide evidence for a role of PLD-derived lipids in the induction of AP-1 enhancer activity resulting from stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex , suggesting that increased PLD activity can play an important role in T lymphocyte activation .
The mechanisms involved in the inhibition of growth of a human B lymphoma cell line , B104 , by anti-MHC class II antibodies ( Ab ) were compared with those in anti-IgM Ab-induced B104 growth inhibition .
Two anti-MHC class II Ab , L227 and 2.06 , inhibited the growth of B104 cells , although 2.06 , but not L227 , needed to be further cross-linked with a goat anti-mouse IgG Ab ( GAM ) to show the effect .
L227 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) from the intracellular pool and little or no protein tyrosine phosphorylation , phosphatidyl inositol turnover , or expression of Egr-1 mRNA , whereas 2.06 plus GAM induced an increase in [Ca2+]i from both the intracellular and , in particular , the extracellular pools .
The inhibition of B104 cell growth induced by anti-MHC class II Ab was Ca(2+)-independent and not inhibited by actinomycin D or cyclosporin A , and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M interphase was not observed .
These features are very different from those observed in B104 cell death induced by anti-IgM Ab .
Neither DNA fragmentation nor the morphology of apoptosis was observed .
These findings demonstrate that cross-linking of MHC class II molecules transduced the negative signals through intracellular mechanisms different from those present in the cross-linking of surface IgM .
NF-kappa B is a pleiotropic regulator of a variety of genes implicated in the cellular response to injury .
This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of NF-kappa B to distinct regions of the promoter elements of numerous genes , including cytokines , growth factor receptors , and adhesion molecules .
Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B complex were used to define the physiologic role of this transcription factor in resting and stimulated granulocytes .
A reduction in the expression of p65 was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide .
This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) .
These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in CD11b integrin expression on the surface of treated cells .
Furthermore , the p65 antisense oligomer effectively abolished an upregulation of CD11b that was produced by formyl-met-leu-phe and TPA .
However , the p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells .
These findings indicate that antisense oligomers to p65 can be used to define the role of NF-kappa B in the activation pathways of neutrophils .
Molecular , biochemical and epidemiological evidence implicate HTLV-I as an etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) .
The Tax protein of HTLV-I , a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression , is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF , IL-2R alpha and IL-2 .
One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors , pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory , cytokine and viral gene expression .
In this report , we demonstrate that NFKB2 ( lyt-10 ) and c-Rel are overexpressed in HTLV-I infected and Tax-expressing cells and , together , account for the majority of the constitutive NF-kappa B binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation .
Most importantly , we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2 ( p100 ) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2 ( p52 ) form , induction of c-Rel , and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression .
Furthermore , the NFKB2 precursor is physically associated with c-Rel and with Tax in HTLV-I infected cells .
We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and , in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel , NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I .
Senescent human T lymphocyte cultures are unable to undergo proliferation , but show no difference from early passage cells in cytotoxic function or surface antigenic profile .
A second feature of senescent T cells is the dramatic reduction in hsp70 production in response to heat shock .
This decline is associated with a decrease in binding of nuclear extracts to the consensus heat shock element .
Interestingly , the progressive decline in the heat shock response of cultured T cells correlates with the percent proliferative life span completed rather than with the actual proliferative activity at the time of heat shock .
This suggests that for senescent T cells the reduced ability to respond to heat shock by producing hsp70 , although possibly lying at the level of transcriptional control , may nevertheless be unrelated to the reduced DNA synthesis or the diminished proliferative activity also manifested by these cells .
Ligation of Ag receptors in T and B lymphocytes initiates signal transduction cascades which alter the expression of genes that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation .
The transmission of signals from the membrane to the nucleus is mediated principally through the action of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases .
We have identified and characterized a novel serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylated the proto-oncogene product , c-Fos , and is termed Fos kinase .
Fos kinase was rapidly activated after ligation of the CD3 and CD2 receptors in Jurkat and normal human T lymphocytes and in response to IL-6 and anti-IgM in the human B cell lines AF10 and Ramos , respectively .
The phorbol ester , PMA , was also a potent inducer of Fos kinase activity in all of the above populations , suggesting that PKC plays a role in the regulation of this enzyme .
Fos kinase phosphorylates c-Fos at a site near the C-terminus , as well as a peptide derived from this region ( residues 359-370 , RKGSSSNEPSSD ) , and Fos peptide competitively inhibited c-Fos phosphorylation .
Fos kinase was shown to be distinct from other identified serine/threonine kinases , including protein kinase A , protein kinase C , casein kinase II , MAP kinases , p70S6K and p90RSK .
Fos kinase was purified by anion exchange chromatography and exhibited an apparent M(r) = 65,000 and isoelectric point = 6.1 .
Fos kinase may play a role in transcriptional regulation through its capacity to phosphorylate c-Fos at a site required for expression of the transcriptional transrepressive activity of this molecule .
Moreover , its rapid activation suggests it may have a wider role within signal transduction cascades in lymphocytes .
The nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a eukaryotic transcription factor .
In B cells and macrophages it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , NF-kappa B translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals .
Using neuroblastoma cell lines as models , we have shown that in neural cells NF-kappa B was present in the cytosol and translocated into nuclei as a result of TNF alpha treatment .
The TNF alpha-activated NF-kappa B was transcriptionally functional .
NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha was not correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation .
However , reagents such as nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which induce phenotypical differentiation of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line , activated NF-kappa B , but only in that particular cell line .
In a NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line , PC12 , PMA activated NF-kappa B , whereas NGF did not .
In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such as SK-N-Be(2) , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated with the lack of NF-kappa B activation .
We found , moreover , that in SK-N-Be(2) cells protein kinase C ( PKC ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a control cell line and that the low PKC enzymatic activity was due to low PKC protein expression .
NF-kappa B was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study .
Thus , NF-kappa B activation was not required for neuroblastoma cell differentiation .
Furthermore , the results obtained with TNF alpha proved that NF-kappa B activation was not sufficient for induction of neuroblastoma differentiation .
Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors .
In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .
Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .
However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but not the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR+2 ) .
The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .
Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .
The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1 is a major regulator of gene expression in erythroid , megakaryocyte , and mast cell lineages .
GATA-1 binds to WGATAR consensus motifs in the regulatory regions of virtually all erythroid cell-specific genes .
Analyses with cultured cells and cell-free systems have provided strong evidence that GATA-1 is involved in control of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .
Targeted mutagenesis of the GATA-1 gene in embryonic stem cells has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development .
Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact GATA element in the distal promoter , suggesting autoregulatory control of GATA-1 transcription .
To examine whether GATA-1 expression involves additional regulatory factors or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory loop , we have used a transient heterokaryon system to test the ability of erythroid factors to activate the GATA-1 gene in nonerythroid nuclei .
We show here that proerythroblasts and mature erythroid cells contain a diffusible activity ( TAG ) capable of transcriptional activation of GATA-1 and that this activity decreases during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells .
Nuclei from GATA-1- mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons , indicating that de novo induction of GATA-1 is not required for globin gene activation following cell fusion .
The transcription factor AP-1 is an important human mediator of the cellular response to serum , growth factors , and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate ( TPA ) .
The AP-1 complex consists of distinct protein heterodimers encoded by the proto-oncogene c-fos and c-jun mRNA whose gene expression can be induced by TPA , cyclic AMP and growth factors .
Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the pathway of TPA and protein kinase C leading to expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA .
To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species we studied the effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid ( natural thiol antioxidants ) on the expression of c-fos mRNA in human Jurkat T cells .
When cells were preincubated with dihydrolipoic acid ( 0.2 mM ) the expression of c-fos mRNA was suppressed at 30 min after stimulation of TPA ( 0.5 microM ) whereas in the case of preincubation of alpha-lipoic acid ( 0.2 microM ) , the expression was enhanced at 30 min .
These studies support the idea that superoxide anion radical plays a role in the expression of c-fos mRNA .
The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat-directed transcription .
While in most cell types , activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR , astrocytic glial cells support TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat .
This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer , a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) present in many cell types , including T lymphocytes .
Tat transactivation mediated by the kappa B domain is sufficient to allow replication of TAR-deleted mutant HIV-1 in astrocytes .
The present study demonstrates the existence of kappa B-specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF-kappa B .
The novel astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column , while prototypical NF-kappa B from Jurkat T cells is not .
In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding factors activate transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the kappa B domain .
Moreover , TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with kappa B-binding activity .
The importance of the central nervous system-enriched kappa B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed .
Exposure of monocytic cells to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins and leads to the rapid induction of inflammatory gene products , including tissue factor ( TF ) .
TF is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades .
Here we report the characterization of a nuclear complex from human monocytic cells that bound to a kappa B-like site , 5'-CGGAGTTTCC-3' , in the 5'-flanking region of the human TF gene .
This nuclear complex was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the TF gene .
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but not p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers .
Base-pair substitutions in the TF site indicated that the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of NF-kappa B .
In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , the TF complex did not migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers .
Antibodies against the NF-kappa B and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the absence of p50 in the TF complex and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF kappa B-like site .
Functional studies indicated that the TF site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65 .
Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a novel kappa B-like site mediated LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells .
To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid ( GC ) -mediated inhibition of T cell functions , the effect of dexamethasone ( DM ) on T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) generation were studied .
Dexamethasone inhibited IL-2-induced T cell proliferation by 30 % - 88 % , relative to its concentration within the cultures .
The effect of DM on expression of IL-2R alpha ( Tac , p55 , CD25 ) and beta ( p75 ) genes in activated T cells was examined next .
In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin ( PHA-p ) and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in IL-2R alpha and a 30 % reduction in IL-2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM ( p < 0.01 ) .
Inhibition of membrane IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta expression by 10(-6) M DM was partially reversible by recombinant human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ) .
By Northern blot analysis , DM caused a comparable decrease in IL-2R alpha and in IL-2R beta mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in mitogen-stimulated T cells .
By in vitro transcription assays , DM regulated IL-2R alpha gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of IL-2R beta gene was unaffected by DM .
The mechanism of action of DM on IL-2R alpha transcription was examined by determining the mRNA levels of the p50 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , a transcription factor that stimulates IL-2R alpha gene expression .
The data indicate that 10(-6) M DM increased T cell p50 NF-kappa B mRNA levels by four-fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM .
Further , the level of nuclear proteins capable of binding to the NF-kappa B sites in activated T cells increased in response to DM .
In sum , DM regulates T cell membrane expression of IL-2R by more than one molecular mechanism .
This study examined the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication in mononuclear phagocytes ( MNP ) .
LIF induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1 .
The magnitude and time kinetics of the LIF effects were similar to interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , other cytokines known to induce HIV replication in this cell line .
To characterize mechanisms responsible for these LIF effects , levels of HIV mRNA , activation of the DNA binding protein nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB , signal transduction pathways , and potential interactions with other cytokines were analyzed .
LIF increased steady-state levels of HIV mRNA at 2.0 , 4.3 , and 9.2 kB .
This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h .
The DNA binding protein NF-kB is a central mediator in cytokine activation of HIV transcription .
NF-kB levels were higher in unstimulated U1 cells as compared to the parent cell line U937 .
In both cell lines LIF increased NF-kB activity .
Induction of NF-kB and HIV replication by cytokines are at least in part dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates .
The oxygen radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine , but not an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , inhibited LIF-induced HIV replication .
LIF induces the production of other cytokines in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by antibodies to IL-1 , TNF , or IL-6 .
These results identify LIF as a stimulus of HIV replication .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS .
To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat on interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) expression , we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system .
Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate .
IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein .
Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level .
The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect .
The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or - unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax - by cyclosporin A .
The observed increase in IL-2 levels might facilitate virus spread from or to T cells .
Furthermore , it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or , together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated , the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients .
NF-kappa B , a 50 kDa/65 kDa ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer , is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the positive regulation of various immune genes .
The aim of this study was to determine whether NF-kappa B is related to a particular cell type and/or differentiation step during immunopoiesis .
Using in situ hybridization on sections from non HIV hyperplastic lymph nodes , we found that the gene of the 105 kDa precursor of p50 was overexpressed in the light zone of germinal centers , with a network aspect , which suggested the involvement of follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) .
By immunohistochemistry , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC , confirming the involvement of FDC .
Furthermore , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of all lymphocytes .
Thus , we focused our study on isolated FDC clusters from normal tonsils .
As showed on tissue sections , we detected the p50 in both cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC .
Nuclei of lymphocytes from FDC clusters were negative .
We next studied p65 and c-Rel protein expression in FDC clusters .
p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of FDC , whereas nuclei were negative .
Furthermore , p65 was detected in the nuclei of some lymphocytes .
c-Rel protein was detected only in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and not in the nucleus and cytoplasm of FDC .
Our results indicated that , in the context of T cell-dependent B cell immunopoiesis occurring in FDC clusters , p50 is mainly related to FDC with a massive overexpression in the nuclei , whereas p65 is expressed in a scattered manner in the nuclei of lymphocytes and c-Rel protein exclusively in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from FDC clusters .
These results suggested that the two subunits of NF-kappa B and the c-Rel protein have different roles in different cell types during B cell immunopoiesis .
The current study examined whether alterations in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding contribute to poor response to glucocorticoid therapy in asthma .
29 asthma patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) < 70 % predicted were studied .
Patients were classified as steroid sensitive ( SS ) if their morning FEV1 increased > 30 % after a 1-wk course of oral prednisone 20 mg twice daily and steroid resistant ( SR ) if they failed to increase > 15 % .
PBMC obtained from these two groups , 17 SR and 12 SS , as well as 12 normal controls were analyzed .
SR patients had two distinguishable GR binding abnormalities : 15 of the 17 SR patients demonstrated a significantly reduced GR binding affinity , as compared with SS patients ( P = 0.0001 ) and normal controls ( P = 0.0001 ) .
This defect was localized to T cells and reverted to normal after 48 h in culture media .
However , incubation with a combination of IL-2 and IL-4 sustained this abnormality .
The other two SR patients had an abnormally low GR number with normal binding affinity that was not limited to T cells .
Furthermore , GR number failed to normalize after incubation in media alone or IL-2 and IL-4 .
Therefore , SR asthma may be due to more than one abnormality , the majority related to a reversible cytokine-induced reduction in GR binding affinity and the second related to an irreversible reduction in GR number .
These findings may have important implications for the design of alternative treatment approaches for recalcitrant asthma .
Skeletal myogenesis is regulated by a group of transcription factors ( MyoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 ) that are " basic helix-loop-helix " proteins that bind to the promoters of muscle-specific genes and promote their expression .
We have previously shown that after a mutation of Leu122 to Arg the DNA binding basic domain of MyoD confers c-myc-like functional characteristics to the protein .
In this study we used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to determine whether such mutations occur naturally in rhabdomyosarcomas .
We have found that the basic domains of all the myogenic factors remain unaltered in rhabdomyosarcomas .
Selection against such mutations may be the result of functional redundancy of these myogenic transcription factors .
Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition .
However , their specific function in these processes has not been clearly defined .
A mAb , R24 , that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside ( GD3 ) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from human peripheral blood .
In this study , we have investigated the mechanisms by which the R24 mAb affects T cell functions .
We have observed that the R24 mAb stimulates GD3+ T cell proliferation , cytotoxicity , and surface marker expression of IL-2R alpha-chain , IL-2R beta-chain , HLA-DR , CD11a , and CD11c .
Additionally , IFN-gamma activity but not IL-1 , IL-2 , or IL-4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation .
In some donors , increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha activity also was detected after R24 treatment .
Furthermore , R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c-rel , but little or no NF kappa B p50 or p65 , from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c-rel and p50 .
This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates .
R24-stimulated increases in proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cell surface protein expression could be blocked by cyclosporin and staurosporin , indicating that cyclophilin/calcineurin and protein kinase C may be involved in the R24 signaling pathway .
Additionally , herbimycin A , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , blocked the R24-stimulated increase in proliferation but not cytotoxicity at concentrations consistent with specificity for tyrosine kinases .
These results suggest that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of human T cells by R24 .
SCL protein production was examined in a variety of hemopoietic cell lines by immunoblotting using specific polyclonal antisera .
SCL protein was detected in erythroid , megakaryocyte , mast and early myeloid cell lines , as well as in several lymphoid leukemia cell lines which are known to harbor SCL gene rearrangements .
In most cell lines , proteins of molecular weight 49 and 44 kDa were found , however two myeloid cell lines expressed only lower molecular weight species of 24 and 22 kDa .
This size discrepancy appeared to be due to cell-specific translational regulation , since overexpression of a retrovirally transfected SCL gene yielded the higher molecular weight forms in most cell lines ( GP+E-86 , AT2.5 , M1 ) but only the 22 kDa form in the myeloid cell line , WEHI-3B/D+ .
Overexpression of full-length SCL protein in the lymphoid cell lines , SupT1 and Raji , did not alter cell phenotype and there was no evidence for autoregulation of SCL transcription .
The restricted pattern of SCL protein synthesis is consistent with the restricted expression of SCL mRNA documented previously .
In addition , the present results indicate that SCL protein size was determined by regulation of translation in a cell-specific manner .
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene has been studied extensively as a model system of transcriptional induction during T-lymphocyte activation .
The GM-CSF gene is not expressed in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the cell surface T-cell receptor .
A highly conserved 19-bp element located immediately 5' of the human GM-CSF TATA box ( bp -34 to -52 ) , herein called purine box 1 ( PB1 ) , has been shown to bind a T-cell nuclear protein complex and to be required for transcriptional induction of the GM-CSF gene following T-cell activation .
The PB1 sequence motif is highly conserved in both human and murine GM-CSF genes .
In this report , we demonstrate that the PB1 element alone confers inducibility on a heterologous promoter following transfection into human Jurkat T cells .
In addition , we identify a major PB1 nuclear protein-binding complex that is not present in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced following T-cell activation .
Sequence analysis revealed that PB1 is composed of adjacent binding sites for Ets and AP-1 transcription factors .
In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that both the Ets and AP-1 sites are required for binding of the inducible PB1 nuclear protein complex and for the transcriptional activity of this element and the GM-CSF promoter in activated T cells .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
It is believed that induction of cytokine expression by bacterial cell wall components plays a role in the development and course of sepsis .
However , most attention has been focused on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
We studied the ability of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamyl-m-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine ( G(Anh)MTetra ) , a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli , to induce cytokine expression in human monocytes .
G(Anh)MTetra was found to strongly induce interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression after 2 h and IL-1 beta and IL-6 protein secretion after 48 h of activation .
The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 transcription factor expression .
Experiments using inhibitors of protein kinase C , protein kinase A , and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways revealed that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression involves activation of an H7-inhibitable pathway .
By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , it was shown that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein , whereas G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation does not .
When responses to G(Anh)MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide ( MDP ) , it was found that the optimal response to G(Anh)MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP .
Furthermore , maximal G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression could be enhanced by co-stimulation with LPS or MDP , suggesting that different receptors and/or transduction pathways were involved .
These results indicate that G(Anh)MTetra induces IL-1 beta and IL-6 expression in human monocytes suggesting a possible role for G(Anh)MTetra in the release of cytokines during sepsis .
Exposure of certain cell types to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , an inducible transcription factor .
One of NF-kappa B 's unique properties is its posttranslational activation via release of an inhibitory subunit , called inhibitor of NF-kappa B ( I kappa B ) , from a sequestered cytoplasmic form .
This event is also triggered under various other conditions of biomedical importance .
Other bacterial toxins , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , T cell mitogens , UV light , gamma rays and oxidative stress were reported to induce NF-kappa B .
The activated form of NF-kappa B , which is rapidly taken up into nuclei , initiates transcription from immediate early genes in a wide variety of cell types .
Most of the target genes for NF-kappa B are of relevance for the immune response and can be grouped into those encoding cytokines , cell surface receptors , acute phase proteins and viral genomes , such as that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) .
We will discuss recent experimental evidences suggesting that LPS might share a pathway of NF-kappa B activation with other inducers of the factor .
This common pathway may involve reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) as messenger molecules .
Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates .
In human monocytes , the inhibitors of these phosphatases , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 alpha .
The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes .
Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities , including those of AP-1 , by these protein phosphatase inhibitors .
Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 beta precursor and mature forms and their secretion .
This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation .
The stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin-1 beta .
However , the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine was increased .
These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production .
The type I interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in T cells .
This signal transduction is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain , which consists of 213 amino acids .
In contrast to the type I receptor , the type II IL-1R has a small cytoplasmic tail , and it is not clear whether this receptor is a signal-transducing or a regulatory molecule .
Here we report that the type II IL-1R does not mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells .
However , a hybrid receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the human type II interleukin-1 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL-1R was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the type I IL-1R .
Our results indicated that the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1R was capable of functionally interacting with interleukin-1 and transmitting the resulting signal to a heterologous cytoplasmic domain .
Interaction between protein kinase C ( PKC ) - and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) -mediated signaling is suggested by the ability of the PKC activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) to inhibit GR-dependent transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Here we report that this interference is cell specific , as TPA augmented dexamethasone-induced transcriptional activation of the MMTV LTR in several T cell lines but was inhibitory in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts .
TPA-GR synergism was determined to have occurred at the GR-responsive element ( GRE ) level by functional analysis of deletion mutants or synthetic GRE oligonucleotides driving chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase expression .
Synergism required an intact GR DNA-binding domain , whereas amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains were dispensable .
The effect was abrogated by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine , suggesting a role for PKC .
Increased c-jun , jun-B , and jun-D expression above basal levels and increased transcriptional activity of AP-1/TPA responsive elements fused to chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase vectors were observed in T cells treated with TPA alone or in combination with dexamethasone .
The ability of Jun proteins to cooperate with GR in T cells has been investigated after transfection of c-jun , jun-B , or jun-D expression vectors , which augmented GR-dependent transcription from either MMTV LTR or GRE .
Conversely , c-jun and jun-B transfection blunted GR-dependent transcription in HeLa cells .
The presence of c-fos had a negative influence on GR function and correlated with the cell-specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of Jun with respect to GR ; high basal expression of c-fos as well as AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in HeLa cells , but not in T cells .
Furthermore overexpression of exogenous c-fos has an inhibitory effect on GR-dependent transcription from GRE in T cells .
We propose that Jun plays a bifunctional role on GR-dependent transcriptional activation of GRE , selecting either synergistic or antagonistic activity depending on the cell-specific microenvironment .
In this regard , intracellular levels of c-fos appear to be influential .
The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) and the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 , both of which are highly conserved in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates .
To delineate the effects of these motifs on the replicative capacity of HIV and to explore the possibility of extending the virus host range , known heterologous enhancer/promoters were inserted into the HIV-1 LTR in place of the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites .
The effects of these substitutions on viral replication in transfected HeLa cells and on HIV infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes or continuous T-leukemia cell lines were evaluated .
HIVs in which the NF- kappa B/Sp1 enhancer plus the downstream TATA element were replaced with heterologous enhancer/promoters were also constructed .
Viruses containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer exhibited infectious kinetics similar to that of wild-type HIV in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and AA2 cells but replicated less efficiently in H9 and CEM cells .
These studies indicate that heterologous enhancer elements are capable of restoring Tat responsiveness to the HIV LTR in the context of directing reporter gene expression as well as in the production of infectious progeny virions .
We studied the effect of interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of two immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun .
These genes encode proteins that form the dimeric complex activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , which is active as a transcriptional factor .
Maximal accumulation of either c-fos and c-jun messenger RNA ( mRNA ) occurred 30 minutes after LPS addition .
When cells were treated with IL-4 for 5 hours before LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA expression was decreased .
The inhibition of c-fos and c-jun expression by IL-4 in LPS-treated cells was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
IL-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts .
Finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that IL-4 inhibits LPS-induced expression of AP-1 protein .
These data indicate that IL-4 suppresses the induction of transcription factors in human activated monocytes .
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) and HTLV-II Tax proteins are potent transactivators of viral and cellular gene expression .
Using deletion mutants , the downstream parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) promoter is shown to be responsive to both HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax as well as the AP1/c-jun proto-oncogene .
Transactivation of PTHrP by Tax was seen in T cells but not in B-cell lines or fibroblasts .
A carboxy terminal Tax deletion mutant was deficient in transactivation of both the PTHrP and IL2R alpha promoters but not the HTLV-I long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Exogenous provision of NFkB rescued IL2R alpha expression but not the PTHrP promoter .
Thus , HTLV-I Tax , HTLV-II Tax , and c-jun transactivate PTHrP and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in adult T-cell leukemia .
In a Jurkat cell model of T-cell activation an interleukin-2 promoter/reporter gene construct was activated by antigen receptor agonism in combination with the lymphokine interleukin-1 .
Antigen receptor signals could be mimicked by suboptimal activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) with phorbol esters in combination with calcium mobilization by an ionophore .
In cotransfection experiments , oncogenic rats obviated the need for PKC stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or interleukin-1 .
Activated ras expression also replaced the requirement for PKC stimulation in activation of the T-cell transcription factor NF-AT .
A dominant inhibitory ras mutant specifically blocked antigen receptor agonism , indicating that ras activity is required for antigen receptor signaling .
In addition , an inhibitor of PKC blocked both activated ras and phorbol ester stimulation , suggesting a role for ras upstream of PKC .
Few known genes ( IL-2 , members of the IL-8 family , interferon-gamma ) are induced in T cells only through the combined effect of phorbol myristic acetate ( PMA ) and a Ca(2+)-ionophore , and expression of only these genes can be fully suppressed by Cyclosporin A ( CyA ) .
We have identified a putative transcription factor , designated PILOT , with an identical dual signal requirement for expression .
Induction of the PILOT gene is detectable in human T cells 20 min following activation in the presence of cycloheximide and is fully suppressed by CyA .
The PILOT protein has a calculated M(r) of 42.6 kDa and contains three zinc fingers of the C2H2-type at the carboxyl-terminus which are highly homologous to the zinc finger regions of the transcription factors EGR1 , EGR2 , and pAT 133 .
In contrast to T cells , in fibroblasts PILOT gene expression requires only one signal ( PMA ) and is not affected by CyA .
This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2+ signal-dependent regulatory element obligatory for expression of some genes in T cells but not in fibroblasts .
This differential expression model will be valuable in the dissection of the dual signal pathway in T cells and the effects of CyA upon it .
The expression of thrombospondin 1 ( TSP 1 ) , a member of the TSP gene family , is rapidly induced by growth factors .
We tested the ability of human TSP 1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs to respond to serum in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells .
Two transcriptional elements in the TSP 1 promoter , a distal element at -1280 and a proximal element at -65 , were required for the response of the human TSP 1 gene to serum .
The distal element contains the 5'-CC(A + T)6GG-3' consensus sequence characteristic of a serum-response element ( SRE ) .
Deletions or mutations in this element reduced the serum response of the TSP 1 gene by 80-90 % .
In gel-shift assays , the -1280 element and the c-fos SRE cross-competed , whereas their functional and binding mutants did not .
The proximal element contains the sequence 5'-GGCCAATGGG-3' , which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y ( CBF , CP1 , alpha CP1 ) .
Deletions or mutations in this element also reduced the serum response by 80-90 % .
Methylation interference analysis of the -65 region identified a pattern of contacts with nuclear factors resembling that for NF-Y , and an NF-Y-binding site and the proximal TSP 1 element cross-competed in gel-shift assays , whereas their binding mutants did not .
Finally , an abbreviated TSP 1 promoter/5'-flank , containing the SRE- and NF-Y-binding sites , mediated a serum response that was close in magnitude to that of the parent promoter .
We conclude that the serum response of the human TSP 1 gene requires the coordinated function of an SRE- and NF-Y-binding site .
Target antigens defined by autoantibodies in IDDM include insulin , a putative glycolipid that reacts with islet cell antibodies , and a 64,000-M(r) protein recently identified as glutamic acid decarboxylase .
In addition , some IDDM sera that contain antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase also coprecipitate a 38,000-M(r) protein from islets .
This study used a high titer anti-38,000-M(r) serum to screen bacteriophage lambda cDNA expression libraries and identified human islet and placental clones encoding jun-B , the nuclear transcription protein , of predicted 38,000 M(r) .
Peripheral blood T-cells exhibited significant proliferation in response to a recombinant fragment of jun-B ( amino acids 1-180 ) in 12 of 17 ( 71 % ) recent-onset IDDM subjects , 8 of 16 ( 50 % ) ICA-positive first-degree relatives of IDDM subjects who were at risk , 3 of 12 ( 25 % ) other autoimmune disease subjects , and 0 of 10 healthy control subjects .
Proliferation to tetanus toxoid did not differ significantly between the groups .
Responses to jun-B were not related to age , sex , or human leukocyte antigen status .
Thus , autoreactive T-cells identify a novel antigen , p38 jun-B , in IDDM and appear to indicate subjects at risk for the development of clinical disease .
We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) gene expression in primary human T lymphocytes following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays , Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies , we found that c-Jun , c-Fos , and octamer-binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5'-flanking sequence .
Additionally , the region between bases -107 and -59 of the IL3 promoter containing putative AP-2 and Sp1 binding motifs appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene .
The data also indicate that CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals .
These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes .
We find that a short enhancer element containing the NF-kappa B binding site from the interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain gene ( IL-2R alpha ) is preferentially activated in T cells .
The IL-2R alpha enhancer binds NF-kappa B poorly and is only weakly activated by the NF-kappa B site alone .
Serum response factor ( SRF ) binds to a site adjacent to the NF-kappa B site in the IL-2R enhancer , and both sites together have strong transcriptional activity specifically in T cells .
Surprisingly , the levels of SRF constitutively expressed in T cells are consistently higher than in other cell types .
Overexpression of SRF in B cells causes the IL-2R enhancer to function as well as it does in T cells , suggesting that the high level of SRF binding in T cells is functionally important .
The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
Here we demonstrate that hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) induced K562 cells to differentiate along a third pathway .
This was accompanied by downregulation of two transcription factors normally expressed in erythroid , mast and megakaryocyte lineages .
Northern analysis demonstrated coordinate downregulation of alpha globin and gamma globin in addition to the two lineage-restricted transcription factors , SCL and GATA-1 .
Proliferation of the K562 cells was also suppressed .
Clonal assay showed that the suppression was irreversible and appeared analogous to the commitment of murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells to terminal differentiation .
In contrast to MEL cells , however , K562 cells acquired a macrophage-like morphology and exhibited a complete failure to generate benzidine-positive cells .
Electron microscopy revealed a marked increase in granules resembling those specific for eosinophils .
Surface marker analysis showed that HMBA-induced cells expressed reduced levels of glycophorin A , CD5 , CD7 and CD11b .
No upregulation of megakaryocyte or lymphoid markers occurred .
Thus the response of K562 cells to HMBA may provide a useful experimental system for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for downmodulation of lineage-restricted transcription factors during hemopoietic lineage commitment .
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) is a transcriptional activator involved in the induction of IL-2 gene expression .
The response element for NF-AT is a sequence localized between -285/-254 in the IL-2 regulatory region .
The composition of NF-AT protein is still not fully elucidated .
We demonstrate that , in normal human T cells , an AP-1 protein is a component of the NF-AT protein complex .
This was evidenced by the ability of the AP-1 site to compete with the NF-AT site for binding to NF-AT and by the capacity of immobilized anti-Jun and anti-Fos antibodies to deplete NF-AT-binding activity from nuclear extracts of activated T cells .
There was no detectable binding of in vitro translated Jun/Fos heterodimer ( AP-1 ) to the NF-AT sequence , and the NF-AT sequence was unable to inhibit the binding of Jun/Fos to the AP-1 sequence .
The presence of an AP-1 protein in the NF-AT protein complex may regulate NF-AT-binding activity through protein-protein interaction .
The E2A gene encodes transcription factors of the helix-loop-helix family that are implicated in cell-specific gene expression as part of dimeric complexes that interact with E box enhancer elements .
It has previously been shown that transcripts of the E2A gene can be detected in a wide range of cell types .
We have now examined expression of the mouse E2A gene at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the E2A protein to probe blots of cellular extracts .
A 73 kDa protein was identified by this analysis : this protein is highly enriched in cell lines of B lymphoid origin as compared to pancreatic beta-cells and fibroblast cells .
The detection of this protein selectively in extracts of lymphoid cells correlates with the presence of the E box-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 in these cells ; this binding activity was previously shown to be efficiently recognized by antiserum directed against E2A gene products .
Transfection of cells with full length E2A cDNA leads to appearance of protein co-migrating with the 73 kDa protein on SDS gel electrophoresis and co-migrating with LEF1/BCF1 on mobility shift analysis .
Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins ; the selective appearance of this putative cell-specific transcription factor in B lymphoid cells seems to be attributable , at least in part , to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells .
We have investigated an oxidoreductive regulatory pathway for the DNA binding activity of a pleiotropic cellular transcription factor , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , has been investigated by using NF kappa B prepared from the nucleus and the cytosol of the primary human T lymphocytes .
We show that a cellular reducing catalyst thioredoxin ( Trx ) plays a major role in activation of the DNA binding of NF kappa B in vitro and stimulation of transcription from the NF kappa B-dependent gene expression .
We demonstrate evidence suggesting that redox regulation of NF kappa B by Trx might be exerted at a step after dissociation of the inhibitory molecule I kappa B , a cytosolic-anchoring protein for NF kappa B .
To examine the effect of Trx in intact cells , we performed transient assay with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-expressing plasmid under the control of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeat and an effector plasmid expressing human Trx .
The promoter activity from HIV long terminal repeat was greatly augmented by co-transfecting the Trx-expressing plasmid , whose effect was dependent on the NF kappa B-binding sites .
These findings have suggested that cysteine residue ( s ) of NF kappa B might be involved in the DNA-recognition by NF kappa B and that the redox control mechanism mediated by Trx might have a regulatory role in the NF kappa B-mediated gene expression .
These results may also provide a clue to understanding of the molecular process of AIDS pathogenesis and its possible biochemical intervention .
The expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 was studied in eosinophils and basophils .
Eosinophils express mRNA for GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 .
Basophils express GATA-2 and GATA-3 .
Treatment of HL-60 eosinophilic sublines with either interleukin-5 or butyric acid increased the expression of GATA-1 mRNA concomitant with the expression of eosinophil-specific genes , whereas levels of GATA-2 mRNA remained relatively constant .
The presence of mRNA for these proteins in eosinophils and basophils suggests that gene transcription in these lineages may be regulated by GATA-binding proteins .
Human peripheral blood monocytes ( Mo ) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for IL-2 , whereas expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain is not constitutive but inducible with IL-2 .
Here we report that binding of human IL-2 to its binding site leads to transcriptional activation of the macrophage CSF ( M-CSF ) gene in Mo resulting in accumulation of M-CSF mRNA and subsequent release of bioactive M-CSF protein as demonstrated by ELISA and inhibition of IL-2 induced release of an activity-stimulating growth of monocyte-type colonies by a neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody .
Transcriptional activation of the M-CSF gene by IL-2 is preceded by enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its recognition sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the M-CSF gene .
Moreover , using a heterologous promoter ( herpes thymidine kinase ) construct containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence , it is shown that NF-kappa B binding by an IL-2-induced monocyte-derived nuclear protein confers reporter gene ( human growth hormone ) activity .
Taken together , our findings indicate that IL-2 induces gene expression of M-CSF in human blood-derived Mo and provide evidence for involvement of NF-kappa B in transcriptional regulation of this gene .
The molecular mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in a major cell reservoir such as the macrophage remain unknown .
NF-kappa B is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the HIV long terminal repeat and is selectively activated following HIV infection of human macrophages .
Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate NF-kappa B activation in monocytes-macrophages is available , our previous work indicated that classical protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoenzymes were not involved in the HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation .
In this study , we have focused on atypical PKC isoenzymes .
PKC-zeta belongs to this family and is known to be an important step in NF-kappa B activation in other cell systems .
Immunoblotting experiments with U937 cells demonstrate that PKC-zeta is present in these cells , and its expression can be downmodulated by antisense oligonucleotides ( AO ) .
The HIV-mediated NF-kappa B activation is selectively reduced by AO to PKC-zeta .
In addition , cotransfection of a negative dominant molecule of PKC-zeta ( PKC-zeta mut ) with NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes selectively inhibits the HIV- but not phorbol myristate acetate- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NF-kappa B .
That PKC-zeta is specific in regulating NF-kappa B is concluded from the inability of PKC-zeta ( mut ) to interfere with the basal or phorbol myristate acetate-inducible CREB- or AP1-dependent transcriptional activity .
Lastly , we demonstrate a selective inhibition of p24 production by HIV-infected human macrophages when treated with AO to PKC-zeta .
Altogether , these results suggest that atypical PKC isoenzymes , including PKC-zeta , participate in the signal transduction pathways by which HIV infection results in the activation of NF-kappa B in human monocytic cells and macrophages .
BACKGROUND : Understanding the mechanism of developmental regulation of hemoglobin switching has scientific as well as clinical relevance because of the influence of fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) production in adulthood on the clinical manifestation of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia .
We have previously found that the normal developmental patterns of globin gene expression are recapitulated in an experimental system of primary cultures that support differentiation of erythroid progenitors .
We further found that high activities of the transcriptional activators , GATA-1 and SP1 , are associated with normal adult erythroid differentiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : In the present work , we have studied , the activities of GATA-1 and SP1 during differentiation of cultured erythroid progenitors derived from cord blood and from fetal livers , as well as from beta zero-thalassemia patients .
RESULTS : The results showed high GATA-1 binding activity and very low SP1 activity in the fetal liver cultures .
This pattern was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood , in which both GATA-1 and SP1 activities were high .
Cord blood cultures showed an additive combination of " adult " and " fetal " patterns .
The progenitors derived from a beta zero-thalassemia patient with high HbF production showed " fetal " pattern .
On the other hand , in cultures of 2 beta zero-thalassemia patients without high HbF , " adult " pattern was observed .
CONCLUSIONS : In the present work , we show that human fetal and adult erythroid progenitors are distinct in their transcription factors , and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation stage .
Our studies also demonstrate that under anemic stress , recruitment of fetal progenitors may occur in adulthood .
Two groups of HMG box proteins are distinguished .
Proteins in the first group contain multiple HMG boxes , are non-sequence-specific , and recognize structural features as found in cruciform DNA and cross-over DNA .
The abundant chromosomal protein HMG-1 belongs to this subgroup .
Proteins in the second group carry a single HMG box with affinity for the minor groove of the heptamer motif AACAAAG or variations thereof .
A solution structure for the non-sequence-specific C-terminal HMG box of HMG-1 has recently been proposed .
Now , we report the solution structure of the sequence-specific HMG-box of the SRY-related protein Sox-4 .
NMR analysis demonstrated the presence of three alpha-helices ( Val10-Gln22 , Glu30-Leu41 and Phe50-Tyr65 ) connected by loop regions ( Ser23-Ala49 and Leu42-Pro49 ) .
Helices I and II are positioned in an antiparallel mode and form one arm of the HMG box .
Helix III is less rigid , makes an average angle of about 90 degrees with helices I and II , and constitutes the other arm of the molecule .
As in HMG1B , the overall structure of the Sox-4 HMG box is L-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of conserved , mainly aromatic residues .
To identify osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors , we initiated an analysis of the promoter of a mouse osteocalcin gene , an osteoblast-specific gene .
In this promoter , we identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements ( Ducy , P. and Karsenty , G. ( 1995 ) Mol.Cell.Biol.15 , 1858-1869 ) .
The sequence of one of these elements , OSE2 , is identical to the DNA-binding site of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 transcription factors , the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Runt protein .
Here we show , using nuclear extracts , recombinant protein , and a specific antiserum against AML-1 proteins in DNA-binding assays , that one member of this family , AML-1B , binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to OSF2 , the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2 .
By DNA cotransfection experiments , we also demonstrate that AML-1B can increase the activity of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to OSE2 .
Lastly , the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract-DNA complexes compared with T-cell nuclear extract-DNA complexes , along with the inability of OSF2 to be upregulated by retinoic acid , unlike the other PEBP2 alpha factors , suggest that OSF2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors .
Thus , this study demonstrates that AML-1B can increase gene expression of an osteoblast-specific gene through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element and presents evidence that OSF2 is a member of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 family of transcription factors .
Thrombopoietin is known to be essential for megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis .
Recently , we and others have shown that thrombopoietin induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and other proteins in human platelets and BaF3 cells , genetically engineered to express c-Mpl , a receptor for thrombopoietin .
The Jak family of tyrosine kinases are known to mediate some of the effects of cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors by recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
Hence , we have investigated whether Stat proteins are present in platelets and , if so , whether they become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to thrombopoietin .
We immunologically identified Stat1 , Stat2 , Stat3 , and Stat5 in human platelet lysates .
Thrombopoietin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in these cells .
Thrombopoietin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in FDCP-2 cells genetically engineered to constitutively express human c-Mpl .
Thus , our data indicate that Stat3 and Stat5 may be involved in signal transduction after ligand binding to c-Mpl and that this event may have a role in megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis or possibly a mature platelet function such as aggregation .
It is well established that the two major glial cells in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , astrocytes and microglia , are key participants in mediating the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV infection of the CNS .
In this study , we investigated the ability of the major envelope glycoprotein of HIV , glycoprotein 120 ( gp120 ) , to regulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) expression in glial cells , because ICAM-1 is important in mediating immune responsiveness in the CNS , facilitating entry of HIV-infected cells into the CNS , and promoting syncytia formation .
Our results indicate that gp120 enhances ICAM-1 gene expression in primary rat astrocytes , primary human astrocytes , a human astroglioma cell line CRT , and primary rat microglia .
The signal transduction events involved in gp120-mediated enhancement of ICAM-1 appear to involve activation of both protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase , because inhibitors of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase abrogate gp120-mediated ICAM-1 expression in both astrocytes and microglia .
Moreover , gp120 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT-1 alpha ) as well as the Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) in glial cells .
We also demonstrate that gp120-mediated ICAM-1 expression has functional significance , as it enhances the ability of monocytic cells to bind to gp120-stimulated human astrocytes in an ICAM-1/beta 2 integrin-dependent fashion .
These results provide new insights into how gp120 can influence the involvement of glial cells in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia complex .
Activation through the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway is essential to the transcription of many cytokine genes .
The conserved cis-acting sequence , GGAAAA , and transcription factors binding to this sequence are involved in the response to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations .
Here we report the identification and importance of the same sequence in a non-cytokine gene , the human T cell receptor gamma ( TCRG ) enhancer .
Results from site-directed mutations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that this sequence mediates the ionomycin-induced activation of the TCRG enhancer .
Our studies provide an explanation for a previous observation that TCRG mRNA levels , but not mRNA levels for T cell receptor alpha and -beta , are increased by ionomycin treatment .
A number of cytokines and growth factors use the JAK-STAT pathway to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus .
While homodimerizing cytokine receptors may transmit signal via a single form of JAK ( i.e. growth hormone receptors ) , several multicomponent cytokine receptors have been shown to require simultaneous activation of pairs of different JAK kinases ( i.e. interferon receptors ) .
Recent evidence for a preferential coupling of JAK3 to interleukin-2 receptor-gamma ( IL-2R gamma ) and JAK1 to IL-2R beta supports the concept of heterotrans-activation of JAK1 and JAK3 caused by IL-2-induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners .
The present study verified the ability of IL-2 to cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 and JAK3 , but demonstrated that IL-2 stimulated JAK3 to a significantly larger extent than JAK1 in human T lymphocytes and the YT cell line .
This conclusion was based upon several independent criteria , including more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 , more marked enzymatic activation of JAK3 as well as higher abundance of JAK3 in activated IL-2 receptor complexes .
Furthermore , when human IL-2R beta was stably expressed in murine BA/F3 cells , robust IL-2-induced proliferation and JAK3 activation occurred without detectable involvement of either JAK1 , JAK2 or TYK2 .
We therefore propose that IL-2 receptor signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of JAK1 and JAK3 following IL-2-induced heterodimerization of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma .
Nonetheless , a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2R beta ( Asn240-Leu335 ) was critical for JAK3 activation , and the amount of JAK3 present in activated IL-2 receptor complexes increased with time , suggesting that stabilization of JAK3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma .
Moreover , STAT5 was found to be the predominant STAT transcription factor used by IL-2 in human T cells , and specifically required a COOH-terminal region of IL-2R beta ( Ser386-Val525 ) , while STAT5 recruitment was not correlated to activation of IL-2R gamma or JAK3 .
In addition to biophysical properties , pulmonary surfactant has immunomodulatory activity .
We previously demonstrated that both synthetic ( Exosurf ) and modified natural surfactant ( Survanta ) downregulated endotoxin-stimulated inflammatory c ytokine mRNA levels and protein products ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNF ] , interleukin-1-beta [ IL-1 ] , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] ) in human alveolar macrophages .
In this study , we report that both Exosurf and Survanta suppress TNF mRNA and secretion ( 85 +/- 4 % mean percent inhibition +/- SEM by Exosurf ; 71 +/- 6 % by Survanta ) by endotoxin-stimulated THP-1 , a human monocytic cell line .
Because surfactant downregulated inflammatory cytokine production similarly in both normal human alveolar macrophages and the THP-1 cell line , we used this cell line to investigate whether surfactant affected transcriptional mechanisms .
Specifically , we examined nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation because it is crucial in transcriptional regulation of many inflammatory cytokine genes including TNF , IL-1 , and IL-6 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that both surfactants decreased activation of NF-kappa B .
The presence of both p65 and p50 NF-kappa B components in LPS-activated THP-1 cells was confirmed by specific antibody induction of supershifts in mobility assays .
These results are the first to suggest that surfactant 's suppressive effects on inflammatory cytokine production may involve transcriptional regulation through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation .
Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle .
A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity .
Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( HD1 ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library .
As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription .
Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein-1 ( r-h TBP-1 ) and recombinant human soluble dimeric TNF receptor ( rhu TNFR : Fc ) were used to determine the relative contributions of TNF to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and cytokine-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in chronically infected cell lines .
Treatment of HIV-1-infected promonocytic U1 cells with r-h-TBP-1 or rhu TNFR : Fc reduced PMA-induced HIV-1 p24 antigen production in a concentration-dependent manner , with a maximal inhibition of approximately 90 % .
Maximal inhibition of p24 antigen production in T-lymphocytic ACH-2 cells was 47 % with r-hTBP-1 and 42 % with rhu TNFR : Fc .
r-hTBP-1 and rhu TNFR : Fc also decreased p24 antigen synthesized by U1 cells in response to other stimuli , including phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced supernatant , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , interleukin-6 , and TNF .
Addition of r-hTBP-1 to U1 cells during the last 4 h of a 24 h incubation with PMA still inhibited p24 antigen production by 15 % .
U1 cells stimulated with 10(-7) M PMA released approximately 1 ng/ml endogenous TBP-1 with an initial peak observed at 1 h and a second peak at 24 h after PMA stimulation .
r-hTBP-1 also partially reversed inhibition of U1 cellular proliferation caused by PMA .
Both r-hTBP-1 and rhu TNFR : Fc blocked PMA induction of nuclear factor ( NK ) - kappa B DNA-binding activity in U1 cells in association with decreases in HIV-1 replication .
We conclude that soluble TNF receptors can inhibit stimuli-induced HIV-1 expression and NK- kappa B DNA-binding activity in chronically infected U1 cells .
Two Jurkat cell clones have been stably transfected with a reporter vector for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
Upon stimulation , they express high levels of secreted heat stable placental alkaline phosphatase .
With these clones , we demonstrated that NFAT activation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin was inhibited by both cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( IC50 = 8 nM ) and FK506 ( IC50 = 160 pM ) , presumably by inhibition of calcineurin activity .
Selective phosphatase inhibitors for protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) and 2A ( PP2A ) that do not inhibit calcineurin , such as okadaic acid and calyculin A , also inhibited NFAT activation with IC50s of 87 nM and 4 nM , respectively , suggesting that okadaic acid and related inhibitors may block NFAT activation through the inhibition of PP1 , instead of PP2A .
NFAT activation was also inhibited by agents that increase cAMP concentrations such as dibutyryl cAMP , forskolin and prostaglandin E2 .
These stable Jurkat cell clones provide a convenient and sensitive tool to study NFAT regulation .
Although transcriptional factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) are important for the normal induction of IL-2 , it is unknown if the age-related decline in IL-2 production by activated human T cells may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins .
In the current studies , IL-2 production by T cells from elderly ( mean 78 years ) and young ( mean 37 years ) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with PHA , PHA plus PMA , crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus PMA , or PMA plus ionomycin .
Substantial decreases of IL-2 production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli , whereas the levels of IL-2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects .
Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased IL-2 production by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both AP-1 and NF-AT .
By contrast , T cells from elderly subjects with normal levels of IL-2 production exhibited normal activation of AP-1 and NF-AT .
In addition , the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF-AT showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent NF-AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 .
The resting and stimulated levels of NF kappa B were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals ; however , alterations of NF kappa B did not correlate with changes in IL-2 expression .
Thus , these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of AP-1 and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL-2 and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 may contribute to the impaired activation of NF-AT .
The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator ( META ) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region .
Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes , being specific to T cells , dependent on their activation , and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) .
DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site , META(P) , and a promoter-distal site , META(D+) , within the 400-base pair META region .
Nuclear factors from unstimulated , but not from activated cells , bound a site , META(D-) , adjacent to META(D+) .
META(D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene , and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible , CsA-sensitive T cell factors , in parallel with transfection results .
Authentic NFAT and NF-kappaB targets did not compete for the META(D+) binding factor ( s ) .
The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors , but META(D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe .
Our results , taken together , indicate that META(D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity , activation dependence , and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element .
It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas .
A variety of cytokines and growth factors act through an induction of gene expression mediated by a family of latent transcription factors called STAT ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs promotes their homodimer and heterodimer formation and subsequent nuclear translocation .
We demonstrate here that STAT protein heterocomplexes exist prior to cytokine treatment .
When unstimulated HeLa cells are ruptured in hypotonic buffer without salt or detergent , immunoadsorption of either STAT1 or STAT2 from the resulting cytosol yields coimmunoadsorption of the other STAT protein .
Similarly , STAT1-STAT3 heterocomplexes are coimmunoadsorbed from hypotonic cytosol .
STAT1 and STAT2 or STAT1 and STAT3 translated in reticulocyte lysate spontaneously form heterocomplexes when the translation lysates are mixed at 0 degrees C .
Our data suggest that interferon-alpha /beta-induced tyrosine phosphorylation increases the stability of a preexisting , latent , STAT1-STAT2 signaling complex .
Newly translated STAT1 binds in equilibrium fashion to STAT2 and STAT3 , but we show that STAT2 and STAT3 exist in separate heterocomplexes with STAT1 , consistent with a model in which STAT1 contains a common binding site for other STAT proteins .
To develop a transformation system with a conditional Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) gene , we fused the hormone binding domain of the oestrogen receptor to the N or C terminus of EBNA2 .
In promoter transactivation as well as primary B cell transformation assays these chimeric EBNA2 proteins are able to substitute for wild-type EBNA2 in the presence of oestrogen .
Here we provide evidence that this transformation is the result of double infection of a cell with two virions , the P3HR1 virus genome and a mini-EBV plasmid carrying the chimeric EBNA2 gene .
Unexpectedly , expression of the same EBNA2-oestrogen receptor fusion protein in established human B cell lymphoma lines resulted in growth retardation or growth arrest upon the addition of oestrogen .
By titrating the oestrogen concentration in these stably transfected cells , the growth retarding and the transactivating function of the chimeric proteins could not be dissociated .
We propose that growth inhibition of established B cell lymphoma lines is a novel function of EBNA2 which has not been detected in the absence of an inducible system .
It remains open whether the growth retarding property of the EBNA2-oestrogen receptor fusion protein in B cell lymphoma lines is due to unphysiologically high expression of the chimeric protein or to interference with a cellular programme driving proliferation in these cell lines .
This work aimed to ascertain the role of kappaB-responsive elements of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer not only in early initiation but also in long-term maintenance of proviral transcription in cells of the monocytic lineage .
For this purpose , we used three main approaches .
The first was to abruptly terminate tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB binding to the enhancer sequences in U1 monocytic cells , using a short pulse of exogenous tumor necrosis factor .
This resulted in concomitant decrease in nuclear NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and endogenous long terminal repeat transcriptional activity .
The second was to suppress the permanent NF-kappaB translocation induced by HIV-1 replication itself in chronically infected U937 cells , using a specific proteasome inhibitor ( Z-LLL-H ) .
As early as 2 h after addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium , there was an inhibition of both constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and HIV-1 genome expression .
The third approach was to monitor the replication competence in U937 cells of an infectious HIV-1 provirus carrying point mutations in the kappaB-responsive elements of both long terminal repeats .
Compared with its wild-type counterpart , this mutated provirus showed a profoundly decreased , Z-LLL-H-insensitive transcriptional and replicative activity in U937 monocytes .
Together , our results indicate that occupancy of the viral enhancer by NF-kappaB ( p50/p65 ) heterodimers is required for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in monocytes , even in cells chronically infected and permanently producing functional HIV Tat protein .
Thus , the ability of HIV-1 replication to activate NF-kappaB is crucial to the intense self-perpetuated viral transcription observed in cells of the monocytic lineage .
To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE-1 ) , we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1 .
Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene .
Tax alone was also inactive .
However , expression of the reporter gene was induced by coexpression of Tax and CREB .
This effect was stronger with the GAD-CREB fusion protein .
Analysis of different CREB mutants with this genetic system indicated that the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues , which include the basic domain and the leucine zipper , are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by Tax .
To identify cellular proteins binding to TRE-1 in a Tax-dependent manner , this strain was also used to screen a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD .
Of five positive clones isolated from 0.75 x 10(6) yeast colonies , four were members of the CREB/activating transcription factor ( ATF ) family : CREB , two isoforms of the cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator ( CREM ) , and ATF-1 .
Interestingly , these three proteins can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus form a particular subgroup within the CREB/ATF family .
Expression of ATF-2 in S. cerevisiae did not activate TRE-1 in the presence of Tax .
This shows that in a eukaryotic nucleus , Tax specifically interacts with the basic domain-leucine zipper region of ATF-1 , CREB , and CREM .
The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit .
When fused to GAD , the C-terminal region of Ku was able to activate transcription via TRE-1 but this activation was not dependent on Tax .
The A-myb gene encodes a transcription factor that is related both functionally and structurally to the v-myb oncogene .
Following our observations that A-myb is expressed in a restricted subset of normal mature human B lymphocytes , with the phenotype CD38+ , CD39- , slgM- , we have now investigated the pattern of A-myb expression in neoplastic B cells representating the whole spectrum of B-cell differentiation and compared it to that of c-myb and B-myb .
In a panel of 32 B-cell lines , A-myb was very strongly expressed in most Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines , but weak or negative in 2 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , 4 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , 6 Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines , and 6 myeloma lines .
Protein expression paralleled that of the RNA .
We have also investigated A-myb expression in 49 fresh cases of B leukemias .
Among 24 ALL , 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and all these were negative for A-myb expression ; on the other hand , all 7 B-ALL cases ( slg+ ) , as well as one fresh BL case with bone marrow infiltration , expressed A-myb .
A-myb was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic leukemias ( PLL ) but was strongly expressed in 5/20 ( 25 % ) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) samples .
In the latter A-myb did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage .
Finally , we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into Richter 's syndrome and have found that the Richter 's cells expressed about 25-fold less A-myb RNA than the CLL cells from the same patient .
The pattern of c-myb and B-myb was clearly distinct from that of A-myb .
C-myb and B-myb were expressed in all neoplastic groups , except in CLL cells .
Thus , A-myb expression , unlike that of c-myb and B-myb , is restricted to a subset of B-cell neoplasias ( in particular BL and slg+B-ALL ) representative of a specific stage of B-cell differentiation .
This expression may in part reflect expression of A-myb by the normal germinal center B cells that are the normal counterpart of these transformed B cells .
The data presented strongly support a role for this transcription factor in B-cell differentiation and perhaps in B-cell transformation in some neoplasias .
In human Jurkat T cells and its subclone Wurzburg cells oxidant challenge elevated [Ca2+]i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores .
In Jurkat cells this effect was rapid and transient , but in Wurzburg cells the response was slow and sustained .
H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA .
In Jurkat cells that are not sensitive to H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation , H2O2 potentiated NF-kappaB activation in the presence of sustained high [Ca2+]i following thapsigargin treatment .
NF-kappaB regulatory effect of alpha-lipoate and N-acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of [Ca2+]i following oxidant challenge .
Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i is a significant factor in oxidant-induced NF-kappaB activation .
A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection .
OM10.1 , a promyelocyte cell line latently infected with HIV-1 , has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression .
We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any cytokines .
The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using anti-TNF-alpha antibody and various inhibitors .
Although the TNF-alpha level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production .
Staurosporine ( PKC inhibitor ) , pentoxifylline ( NF-kappa B inhibitor ) , and Ro5-3335 ( HIV-1 Tat inhibitor ) also inhibited significantly the heat shock induced virus activation .
In particular , staurosporine achieved approximately 90 % inhibition of the HIV-1 antigen expression in heat shock-treated OM10.1 at a non-toxic concentration .
Although the mechanism of HIV-1 activation with heat shock has not been fully elucidated yet , it is presumed PKC plays an important role in HIV-1 activation .
Thus , the present observations will provide a further insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections .
Domain E , considered as the putative hormone binding domain ( HBD ) of the human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with either maltose binding protein ( MBP ) or glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) .
These bacterially-produced MR constructs had no steroid binding activity per se .
In fact , heat shock protein association ( hsp ) is required for high affinity ligand-binding of the MR .
After incubation of purified MBP- or GST-HBD with rabbit reticulocyte lysate , known to be rich in heat shock proteins , we obtained saturable binding of [3H]aldosterone .
The Kd value for aldosterone was 0.3 nM and the Bmax = 32 pmol/mg .
Hormone binding specificity was assessed by competition studies with various steroid ligands .
Sucrose gradient assays performed with [3H]aldosterone-MBP-HBD revealed complex sedimenting at 8.3S and 4.9S with [3H]progesterone-MBP-HBD .
Western-blot analysis of the sedimentation peak showed the concomitant presence of MBP-HBD by a monoclonal anti-MBP antibody , and hsp90 by a monoclonal anti-hsp antibody .
Moreover , following incubation with the anti-rabbit hsp90 monoclonal antibody the sedimenting gradient showed a 10.4S sedimenting complex .
These analyses demonstrated that the [3H]aldosterone-MBP-HBD complex is at least associated with hsp90 in reticulocyte lysate and that the HBD of hMR is sufficient to bind hsp90 .
Deletions of a relatively short amino- ( 729-766 ) or carboxy- terminal ( 940-984 ) region of the HBD fragment eliminated all steroid-binding properties .
Overall , these results indicate that the integrity of domain E is necessary and sufficient to bind steroid ligands , agonists or antagonists , with characteristics similar to the entire native MR .
The protein product of the c-fps/fes ( c-fes ) proto-oncogene has been implicated in the normal development of myeloid cells ( macrophages and neutrophils ) .
mRNA for c-fes has been detected exclusively in myeloid cells and vascular endothelial cells in adult mammals .
Although a 13-kilobase-pair ( kb ) human c-fes transgene exhibits high levels of expression in mice , the sequences that confer myeloid-cell-specific expression of the human c-fes gene have not been defined .
Transient-transfection experiments demonstrated that plasmids containing 446 bp of c-fes 5'-flanking sequences linked to a luciferase reporter gene were active exclusively in myeloid cells .
No other DNA element within the 13-kb human c-fes locus contained positive cis-acting elements , with the exception of a weakly active region within the 3'-flanking sequences .
DNase I footprinting assays revealed four distinct sites that bind myeloid nuclear proteins ( -408 to -386 , -293 to -254 , -76 to -65 , and -34 to +3 ) .
However , the first two footprints resided in sequences that were largely dispensable for transient activity .
Plasmids containing 151 bp of 5'-flanking sequences confer myeloid-cell-specific gene expression .
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that the 151-bp region contains nuclear protein binding sites for Sp1 , PU.1 , and/or Elf-1 , and a novel factor .
This unidentified factor binds immediately 3' of the PU.1/Elf-1 sites and appears to be myeloid cell specific .
Mutation of the PU.1/Elf-1 site or the 3' site ( FP4-3' ) within the context of the c-fes promoter resulted in substantially reduced activity in transient transfections .
Furthermore , transient-cotransfection assay demonstrated that PU.1 ( and not Elf-1 ) can transactivate the c-fes promoter in nonmyeloid cell lines .
We conclude that the human c-fes gene contains a strong myeloid-cell-specific promoter that is regulated by Sp1 , PU.1 , and a novel transcription factor .
The human T-cell leukemia virus-encoded tax protein is a potent activator of many viral and cellular genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II .
We find that both chromatin and cell extracts derived from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-infected human T lymphocytes support higher levels of 5S rRNA and tRNA gene transcription than chromatin or extracts from uninfected T lymphocytes .
The viral protein Tax was likely responsible for this higher level of class II gene transcription , as purified Tax was found to stimulate both genes when added to the uninfected cell extract or in reconstituted systems .
Both limiting-component transcription assays and DNA binding assays identified the class III gene transcription factor TFIIIB as the principle target of Tax activity .
Surprisingly , we find that Tax increases the effective concentration of active TFIIIB molecules .
These data suggest that Tax stimulates RNA polymerase III-dependent gene expression by accelerating the rate and/or extent of transcription initiation complex assembly .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells , fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells .
Although GM-CSF does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis , overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation .
An NF-kappaB/Rel binding site within the GM-CSF promoter , termed the kappaB element appears to be important for controlling expression in reporter gene assays in response to a number of stimuli in T cells .
We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this regulatory sequence as a potential tool to inhibit GM-CSF gene transcription .
A 15-base oligonucleotide , GM3 , was targeted to a purine-rich region in the GM-CSF proximal promoter , which overlaps the kappaB element .
Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence-specific collinear triplex with its double-stranded DNA target .
Triplex formation by GM3 blocked recombinant and nuclear NF-kappaB proteins binding to the GM-CSF element .
GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax transactivator-induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM-CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells .
Finally , GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous GM-CSF mRNA induced by different stimuli in Jurkat T cells but did not affect interleukin 3 mRNA levels in the same cells .
We conclude that the kappaB element in the GM-CSF promoter plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of the endogenous GM-CSF gene .
Colinear triplex formation acts as a selective transcriptional repressor of the GM-CSF gene and may have potential therapeutic application in cases of undesirable overexpression of this protein .
PU.1 ( spi-1 ) , a member of the Ets transcription factor family , is predominantly expressed in myeloid and B cells , activates many B cell and myeloid genes , and is critical for development of both of these lineages .
Our previous studies ( Chen , H.M. , Ray-Gallet , D. , Zhang , P. , Hetherington , C.J. , Gonzalez , D.A. , Zhang , D.-E. , Moreau-Gachelin , F. , and Tenen , D.G. ( 1995 ) Oncogene 11 , 1549-1560 ) demonstrate that the PU.1 promoter directs cell type-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines , and that PU.1 activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop .
Here we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well .
Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro , and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo .
We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells ; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site , and the PU.1 autoregulatory site .
Finally , we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells , and that OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells .
This B cell restricted coactivator may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU.1 mediated by the octamer site .
IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation .
Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag .
In this work , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma , as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor , STAT1(alpha) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription .
This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta- chain ( accessory factor ) of the IFN-gamma receptor , while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression .
Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment .
T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma .
When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness ; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain .
Therefore , as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2-dependent proliferation , followed by secondary TCR stimulation , their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies , and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response .
IL-10 is a potent mediator of human B cell growth and plasma cell formation .
However , signal transduction of IL-10 in B cells is poorly understood .
In this study the effect of IL-10 on the expression of the protooncogene c-fos was investigated , because Fos plays a potential role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation .
B cells were purified from buffy coat preparations of healthy blood donors by positive selection using an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody and a MiniMACS separation unit .
B cells were prestimulated with SAC for 48 hrs .
Then , cells were incubated with medium or IL-10 ( 100 ng/ml ) for 10 to 120 min .
RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and c-fos expression was analyzed by PCR assisted mRNA assay .
A significant 2-4 fold increase of c-fos expression was observed within 30 min of stimulation with IL-10 ( p < 0.01 ) .
After 2 hrs c-fos expression declined to basal levels .
The effect of IL-10 was dose-dependent with a maximum stimulation using 100 ng/ml of IL-10 .
The IL-10 effect on c-fos expression was not blocked by polymyxin B .
Using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ( 10 microM ) a complete inhibition of IL-10 induced c-fos expression was observed .
In addition , H-7 ( 10 microM ) , a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases , significantly blocked IL-10 mediated c-fos expression ( p < 0.05 ) .
In conclusion , these data show that IL-10 induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases .
Since this is the first report on IL-10 induced signal transduction , these data may help to identify the intracellular mechanisms by which IL-10 stimulates human B-cells .
The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) and B cell octamer-binding protein 1/octamer-binding factor 1/Oct coactivator from B cells ( Bob1/OBF-1/OCA-B ) represent two B cell-specific transcriptional coactivators .
CIITA and Bob1 interact with proteins that bind to conserved upstream sequences in promoters of class II major histocompatibility genes and octamer-binding transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 , respectively .
Both CIITA and Bob1 increase the expression from the DRA promoter , which is a prototypic class II promoter .
Moreover , in the presence of CIITA , interactions between class II promoters and Bob1 are independent of the octamer-binding site .
Using in vivo and in vitro binding assays , we confirm that Bob1 binds to CIITA .
Thus , CIITA not only activates the expression of class II genes but recruits another B cell-specific coactivator to increase transcriptional activity of class II promoters in B cells .
The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement .
Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21ras oncoprotein .
CaMKIV/ Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin .
AP-1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells .
We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells .
These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca(2+)-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .
Nuclear factor of activated T cells-family proteins ( NFAT1/NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFAT4/NFATx/NFATc3 ) play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .
We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 .
NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains whose sequences are not conserved in the other NFAT-family proteins , and a conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein .
The activity of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain is modulated by an adjacent regulatory region that contains several conserved sequence motifs represented only in the NFAT family .
Our results emphasize the multiple levels at which NFAT-dependent transactivation is regulated , and predict significant differences in the architecture of cooperative transcription complexes containing different NFAT-family proteins .
In human monocytes , interleukin 1beta protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide , predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the interleukin 1beta gene .
Expression of interleukin 1beta and other cytokines , such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha , has been shown to be dependent on the activation of the transcription factor , NFkappaB .
Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tyrosine kinase activation is not required for NFkappaB nuclear translocation , we sought to determine whether NFkappaB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription .
We have found that , in the human pro-monocytic cell line , THP-1 , the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of interleukin 1beta is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation .
Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of NFkappaB .
However , in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , the ability of NFkappaB to stimulate transcription is impaired .
This inhibition of transcription is specific for NFkappaB ; in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , AP-1-dependent transcription is enhanced .
These results suggest that , while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity , tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction .
The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of many genes in activated human monocytes and endothelial cells .
In this study , we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) , tissue factor , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes .
Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP , which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms , inhibited TNFalpha and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription .
Induction of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , decrease nuclear translocation of p65 , or significantly modify TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p65 .
Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized kappaB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA .
This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated transcription .
All-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes .
However , the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood .
The NB4 cell line , which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse , can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells .
Because interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factors ( IRF-1 and IRF-2 ) and other IFN-inducible gene products regulate cell growth , we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes .
We show that ATRA directly activates IRF-1 gene expression , followed by activation of IRF-2 and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) gene expression with slower kinetics .
In addition to NB4 cells , ATRA also activated IRF-1 gene expression in HL-60 , U937 , and THP-1 cells , which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition .
A more than additive increase in IRF-1 gene expression was seen with ATRA and IFN-gamma in NB4 cells .
ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) activation pathways , suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation .
The ATRA-induced expression of IRF-1 , an activator of transcription and repressor of transformation , may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition , and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid leukemia cells .
X inactivation analysis was performed on normal and hypopigmented skin samples obtained from a female with hypomelanosis of Ito associated with a balanced whole arm X ; 17 translocation .
Severe skewing of X inactivation resulting in inactivity of the intact X was found in blood and cultures of both types of skin , but analysis of DNA prepared directly from hypopigmented skin showed significant inactivation of the translocated X , inconsistent with the usual mechanism of phenotypic expression in X ; autosome translocations .
In addition , dual colour FISH analysis using centromere specific probes for chromosomes X and 17 showed that the breakpoints on both chromosomes lie within the alphoid arrays , making interruption of a locus on either chromosome unlikely .
While partial variable monosomy of loci on chromosome 17p can not be excluded as contributing to the phenotype in this patient , it is argued that the major likely factor is partial functional disomy of sequences on Xp in cell lineages that have failed to inactivate the intact X chromosome .
The lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene intronic enhancer is regulated by multiple nuclear factors .
The previously defined minimal enhancer containing the muA , muE3 , and muB sites is transactivated by a combination of the ETS-domain proteins PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells .
The core GGAAs of the muA and muB sites are separated by 30 nucleotides , suggesting that ETS proteins bind to these sites from these same side of the DNA helix .
We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these elements by using mutated enhancers with altered spacings .
A 4- or 10-bp insertion between muE3 and muB inactivated the mu enhancer in S194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1 , PU.1 , or the muE3-binding protein TFE3 , alone or in pairwise combinations .
Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets-1 bends mu enhancer DNA toward the major groove .
We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the muA and muB elements is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by PU.1 .
Activation of T cells results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes .
The regulation of transcription factors belonging to the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family was analyzed in PHA-activated mononuclear cells and in purified T cells activated by cross-linking cell surface CD3 .
Cell activation resulted in a delayed induction of STAT DNA-binding activity , which was sustained for several days , was composed predominantly of Stat1 and Stat3 , and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D .
Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected , respectively 4 and 24 h after activation .
Stimulation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway , which skews cytokine production toward a Th2 pattern , resulted in the preferential suppression of Stat1 activity .
cAMP inhibited the induction of expression of IL-2 receptor components , but did not inhibit IL-4 receptor alpha-chain and CD69 expression or the induction of activator protein 1 transcription factors .
cAMP signaling inhibited Stat1 at several different levels , including suppression of DNA binding and down-regulation of Stat1 protein and mRNA levels .
Our results demonstrate the regulation of STAT activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the cytokine-activated Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway .
Based on the presence of T cell receptor-beta ( TcR-beta ) gene rearrangements in L428 and HDLM-1 cells , the expression of CD2 in HDLM-1 cells , and the presence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene rearrangement in KM-H2 cells , some researchers have concluded that these long-term cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin 's disease are lymphoid in nature .
The information obtained from these cell lines has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of H-RS cells in tissue despite the frequent absence of lymphoid markers and Ig/TcR gene rearrangements in these cells .
We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of lymphoid markers or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that H-RS cells have a lymphoid origin , because these markers may be aberrant in tumor cells .
In this study , we examined the expression of two T-cell-specific transcription factors ( TCF-1 and GATA-3 ) and one B-cell-specific transcription factor ( BSAP ) in cultured H-RS cells by using a gel mobility shift assay .
The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of cell lineage have been established in a large number of cultured human and murine cell lines .
All three types of H-RS cell lines were consistently negative for BSAP , TCF-1 , and GATA-3 .
The absence of GATA-3 was confirmed in H-RS cells in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique .
Virtually all B-cell lines , with the exception of some myeloma cell lines , are positive for BSAP , which is the transcription factor for promoters for several B-cell markers , including VpreB1 , lambda 5 , CD19 , and CD20 .
All T-cell lines tested were positive for TCF-1 and GATA-3 , which are the transcription factors for promoters for several T-cell-restricted markers , including CD2 , CD3 , TcR , and lck .
The absence of BSAP , TCF-1 , and GATA-3 clearly indicates an underlying difference between H-RS cells and lymphoid cells .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B-cell malignancies .
Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology .
Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas .
It is known that expression of a single viral immediate-early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells .
Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency .
Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate-early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .
Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific .
The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding , basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation .
We report here on the identification of a 17 kDa variant of the 14 kDa Id-3 protein termed Id-3L ( long version ) which possesses a unique 60 amino acid carboxy-terminus generated by read through of a ' coding intron ' and alternative splicing .
Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor 1.1 kb Id-3L transcript together with the predominant 0.95 kb Id-3 transcript in the majority of adult human tissues analysed .
The variant Id-3L protein is functionally distinguishable from conventional Id-3 since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays , it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic helix-loop-helix protein , E47 , to an E box recognition sequence .
Recent studies have defined genetic alterations commonly associated with transformed lymphocytes .
This review suggests roles for these alterations in the development of lymphoid neoplasms .
Damage to the genes encoding proteins that function in intracellular signaling , transcription , or regulation of the cell cycle has been identified and linked at varying degrees to the progression of certain lymphoid malignancies .
An understanding of the mechanistic consequences following such genetic alterations is essential to an understanding of the development of these lymphoid neoplasms .
In contrast , it is also becoming clear that the dysregulated expression of proteins that are not genetically altered can also contribute to the progression of lymphoid malignancies .
One such example is the excessive expression of " normal " lymphokines of cytokines which accompanies many lymphoproliferative diseases .
The dysregulated expression of cytokines during malignancy can result in the augmentation of growth of transformed lymphocytes , as well as an alteration of the anti-tumor immune response .
The latter mechanism is especially important because evasion of the impending immune response is a prerequisite for the progression of lymphoproliferative diseases .
Taken together , this review supports the notion that the development of lymphoid malignancies is multifactorial , involving genetic alterations as well as dysregulated cytokine expression .
Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 ) in that vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are not constitutively expressed , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up-regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand .
Treatment of B lymphocytes with the cytokine IL-4 ( IL-4 ) , in the absence of prior activation , induces a weak up-regulation of VDR expression but fails to generate vitamin D-responsive element ( VDRE ) -reactive nuclear protein complexes or to initiate the genomic transcription of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase .
Stimulation of B lymphocytes by either ligation of CD40 Ag or cross-linking the Ig receptor is also insufficient to render B lymphocytes responsive to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 .
However , this apparent lack of response to the secosterol can be overcome by stimulation of B lymphocytes with a combination of these cellular activation signals , which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression .
In the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 , cellular activation associated with stimulation of such a progression appears to be sufficient for the up-regulation of VDR message and protein and necessary for the establishment of VDRE binding complexes and the induction of 24-hydroxylase message .
Furthermore , biologic functions are modulated , in that the hormone inhibits proliferation in a subset of the activated B cells .
These observations suggest that reactivity to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 is tightly regulated in B lymphocytes , requiring specific signals for its initiation .
Sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted member of the Ig superfamily that mediates adhesion with lymphoid and myeloid cells .
It is expressed on a subpopulation of macrophages in lymphoid tissues and in chronic inflammation ( e.g. , during autoimmune diseases ) .
We have studied the regulation of sialoadhesin expression in vitro and show that glucocorticoids ( GC ) induce sialoadhesin expression on freshly isolated rat macrophages and the rat macrophage cell line R2 .
The cytokines IFN-beta , IFN-gamma , IL-4 , and LPS , although unable to induce sialoadhesin expression by themselves , were able to enhance GC-mediated induction of sialoadhesin .
Sialoadhesin expression was functional as shown by cell adhesion assays with human RBCs .
Northern blotting experiments indicated that regulation predominantly occurred at the mRNA level .
Comparison of the different combinations of GC and cytokines/LPS revealed differences in the level of GC-dependent enhancement of sialoadhesin expression , with IFN-beta and IL-4 being more potent than IFN-gamma and LPS .
Moreover , the effects of IFN-gamma and LPS could be reproduced by priming , whereas IFN-beta and IL-4 were required simultaneously with GC .
The regulation of sialoadhesin expression was mediated by the GC receptor , and not by mineralocorticoid receptor , as shown by inhibition experiments with specific antagonists .
Finally , it is demonstrated that macrophages in the adrenal gland , the major site of endogenous GC production , express sialoadhesin .
This study demonstrates that GC act as a primary inducer of sialoadhesin expression on rat macrophages , and that the response can be enhanced by IFN-beta , T cell-derived cytokines , or LPS .
An acquired deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a recurrent abnormality in myeloproliferative disorders , particularly polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic syndromes .
The association of 20q deletions with myeloid " stem cell " disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes , loss or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of normal hematopoietic progenitors .
We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions in peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes and defined a commonly deleted region of 16 to 21 centimorgan ( cM ) .
To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics .
We have studied 48 patients with polycythemia vera and four patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis .
In each case , cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20 .
Seventeen microsatellite markers that span the common deleted region were used to search for loss of heterozygosity in granulocyte DNA .
No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA .
Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhibited allele loss on 20q .
In each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at distal markers was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity .
Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone .
Therefore , the human androgen receptor assay ( HUMARA ) was used to determine granulocyte clonality .
In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the granulocytes were clonally derived .
In 5 patients the granulocytes appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both granulocytes and T cells .
These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here , the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes .
Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder .
Early studies in murine T cell lines indicated that transcriptional transactivation functions encoded in the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) N-terminal domain are required for glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis .
However , more recent studies in human T cell lines have suggested that the N-terminal domain is not necessary for steroid-regulated apoptosis and that GR-mediated transrepression may be the more critical mechanism .
To better understand the contribution of the GR N-terminal transactivation domain in mediating murine thymocyte apoptosis , we stably transfected GR , GR variants , and the androgen receptor ( AR ) into receptor-negative S49 murine thymoma cells .
GR expression levels were shown to be rate-limiting for initiating the apoptotic pathway , and a positive correlation between steroid sensitivity and GR-mediated induction of an integrated mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) LTR reporter gene was observed .
Analysis of GR chimeric receptors containing the potent VP16 and E1A viral transactivation domains in place of the GR N terminus revealed that even low level expression of these receptors resulted in both enhanced steroid sensitivity and MMTV induction , thus supporting a role for transactivation in apoptosis .
In contrast , we found that AR can initiate apoptosis in S49 cells after treatment with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone , despite its relative inability to induce high level expression of MMTV .
To investigate this further , we examined the steroid-regulated expression of an endogenous thymocyte-specific gene called GIG18 .
We found that GIG18 was rapidly induced to comparable levels by both AR and GR , demonstrating that AR can indeed function as a transcriptional activator in S49 cells and , moreover , that GIG18 induction may be a marker of early apoptotic events in steroid-treated cells .
Taken together , these results support our conclusion that transcriptional transactivation is a necessary signaling component of S49 cell apoptosis , although an additional role for GR-mediated transrepression can not be excluded .
A model of adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) infection was developed in guinea pigs to begin to study its role in the pathogenesis of peripheral lung inflammation .
Forty animals were inoculated intranasally with 10(7.0) pfu of Ad5/animal , and 15 animals inoculated with sterile culture media served as controls .
Viral titres were 10(4.4) , 10(6.1) , 10(5.2) , and 10(2.9) pfu/animal , on days 1 , 3 , 4 , and 7 after infection , respectively .
In situ hybridization to viral DNA and immunocytochemistry for Ad5 E1A protein localized the virus to airway and alveolar epithelial cells .
Histologic examination showed an extensive inflammatory cell infiltration around the airways , with epithelial necrosis and an alveolar exudate that caused localized alveolar collapse in the infected areas .
Immunocytochemistry identified the cells in the infiltrate as cytotoxic T cells .
Although all animals 20 and 47 days after infection had seroconverted to Ad5 , virus was not detected in these groups either by viral plaque assay or in situ hybridization .
Ad5 E1A DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in five of six animals 20 days after infection and in five of five animals 47 days after infection .
In these same animals , E1A protein was detected 20 days after infection in two and 47 days after infection in one while persistent bronchiolitis was observed in four and three animals 20 and 47 days after infection , respectively .
These results demonstrate that the guinea pig provides a useful model to study the role of Ad5 infection in chronic airway inflammation .
Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the human leukemic cell line K562 .
Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of genes encoding gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis .
By using run-on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including gamma-globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA-1 transcription factor .
In contrast , in DOX-treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells .
In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did not affect the half-lives of these mRNAs .
Because the increase in erythroid mRNA steady-state level in anthracycline-treated cells was inhibited by cycloheximide , this suggests that transcriptional activation in ACLA-treated cells and mRNA stabilization in DOX-treated cells were dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
Finally , GATA-1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA-treated but not in DOX-treated cells .
These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , appeared to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms .
Indeed , erythroid gene expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionally by DOX .
We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells .
Here , we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types .
The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and oTAFII110 , while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly .
All cells tested express TAFII105 mRNA , but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID .
Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells .
These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells .
From a murine B-cell cDNA-library we have cloned a cDNA encoding the murine B-cell specific coactivator mBob1 .
The protein is the murine homologue to the recently described human coactivator Bob1 ( hBob1 ) , also referred to as OBF-1 or OCA-B .
We have also characterized the genomic mBob1 clone .
Analysis of its intron-exon structure has allowed identification of a C-terminal splice variant .
mBob1 is B-cell restricted , and is found in all B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell differentiation .
mBob1 interacts with the octamer transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 and stimulates transcription mediated by these factors .
Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation , the molecular mechanism ( s ) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated .
Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) as adhesion molecules are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions .
We observed that in a monocytic ( U937 ) and a bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell-line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced ICAM-1 expression .
Subsequent analysis of the human ICAM-1 promoter has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) upregulate ICAM-1 expression through the presence of a nuclear factor ( NF-kappa B ) target sequence ( TGGAAATTCC ) .
No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF-alpha upon transfection in 293 cells .
We propose that direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and nuclear factor-kappa B factors is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases .
This study was designed to determine the potential cis-elements involved in transcriptional regulation of the mouse perforin gene .
DNase I hypersensitive site ( DHS ) mapping revealed that the perforin locus contained six DHS within 7.0 kb of the 5' upstream sequence ( -7.0 kb ) and two DHS in intron 2 .
The six 5' upstream and one intronic DHS were detected in only perforin-expressing lymphocytes .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activities directed by 5' upstream promoter were detected preferentially in perforin-expressing cell lines .
A construct termed PFP5a containing -795 bp exhibited the highest CAT activity , and PFP9a20 containing only -73 bp also produced significantly high CAT activity in CTLL-R8 cells .
The proximal region in PFP9a20 contained two potential Sp1 binding sites ( GC box and GT box ) and one Ets binding site ( EBS ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that each of the cis-elements bound specific protein factors .
When single-point mutation was introduced to each GC box , EBS , and GT box in PFP9a20 , at least 3-fold less CAT activity was observed in CTLL-R8 cells .
To confirm the importance of the three cis-acting elements in the perforin gene expression , point mutation was introduced again to each proximal GC box , EBS , and GT box of PFP5a .
The point mutations resulted in a 2.5- to 3-fold reduction of CAT activity .
The results suggest that a combination of the three proximal cis-acting elements may constitute a minimal region responsible for CTL-specific expression of perforin .
Coordination of the immune response to injury or disease in the brain is postulated to involve bi-directional discourse between the immune system and the central nervous system .
This cross communication involves soluble mediators , including various growth factors , cytokines , and neuropeptides .
In this report , we demonstrate that the supernatant from activated T-lymphocytes is able to induce the transcription of a potent cytokine , TGF-beta 2 in glial cells .
The activating stimulus invokes signaling mechanisms distinct from known kinase or protease pathways .
Activation of TGF-beta 2 transcription correlates with the loss of binding activity for an 80 kDA glial labile repressor protein , GLRP , to a responsive region within the TFG-beta 2 promoter .
Although GLRP shares some characteristics with the inducible transcription factor AP-1 , it appears to be distinct from known AP-1 family members .
These data along with previous observations demonstrating the potent immunosuppressive activity of TGF-beta 2 , support a model for a feedback mechanism between the activated T-lymphocytes and astrocytes via TGF-beta 2 to regulate the immune response .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , also known as type II interferon , is an important immunoregulatory gene that has multiple effects on the development , maturation , and function of the immune system .
IFN-gamma mRNA and protein are expressed predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes .
The IFN-gamma mRNA is induced/inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals , thus implicating a number of diverse , yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control .
In this review , I describe how DNA methylation and specific DNA binding proteins may regulate transcription of the IFN-gamma gene in response to extracellular signals .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes/macrophages via CD14 , one of the LPS receptors , which is expressed predominantly in these cells .
It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( P-LPS ) also is able to induce inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts .
Therefore , it is important to determine whether CD14 is expressed in gingival fibroblasts and to define the P-LPS-mediated signal-transducing mechanism in the cells .
In this study , we observed unexpectedly by immunohistochemical , Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) , and Northern ( RNA ) blotting assays that CD14 is expressed at high density in human gingival fibroblasts .
P-LPS-induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) gene in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti-human CD14 antibody and was completely inhibited by herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase .
The inhibitor also dramatically inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity of and MCP-1 production by the cells .
Furthermore , P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP-1 gene in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two transcription factors , i.e. , curcumin , an inhibitor of AP-1 , and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor of NF-kappaB .
Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P-LPS-treated cells .
Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the AP-1 and NF-kappaB contents in P-LPS-treated cells .
This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts and to show that the signal-transducing pathway of P-LPS in the cells is mediated by CD14 .
One of the manifestations of human HIV-1 and nonhuman primate SIV infection that lead to disease is reasoned to be secondary to generalized T-cell dysfunction .
The molecular mechanisms associated with the T-cell dysfunction remain to be elucidated .
To address this issue , we sought to utilize the nonhuman primate model to study intracellular signaling events in cells from disease-susceptible rhesus macaques and disease-resistant sooty mangabeys .
Because relatively little is known about these events in nonhuman primates , our laboratory defined optimal conditions , reagents , and assays for the study of signal transduction events in cells from nonhuman primates .
The protein phosphorylation patterns in the two monkeys exhibited quantitative , qualitative , and kinetic differences .
Antibodies to Stat6 detected a unique band in macaque cell lysates .
This band is markedly decreased human cell lysates and never seen in mangabey cell lysates .
Detection of various other intracellular signaling proteins is also described .
The lymphoid src kinase pp56(lck) has been shown to be essential for the induction of different T lymphocyte responses , including CD4-mediated enhancement of Ag-induced T cell activation , early T cell differentiation , induction of IL-2 production , and cytotoxicity .
It is assumed that pp56(lck) acts on these processes by phosphorylating substrates .
However , it has been recently reported that the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function .
In this report we address the contribution of the regulatory and catalytic domains of pp56(lck) to another function of this enzyme independent of CD4 : TCR-induced IL-2 production .
Two pp56(lck) mutants lacking either the entire catalytic domain or the entire NH2 regulatory domain were generated , and their abilities to trigger transactivation of the TCR-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) region of the IL-2 promoter were compared .
Only the catalytic , but not the NH2 regulatory , domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce NF-AT region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response .
Moreover , the catalytic domain of pp56(lck) was able to induce IL-2 cytokine production to an extent similar to that of wild-type pp56(lck) .
We conclude that different domains of the pp56(lck) molecule contribute to regulate distinct biologic functions .
In fact , while the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function , we show here that the catalytic domain of pp56(lck) is sufficient for induction of IL-2 production , mimicking TCR ligation .
Cells need to distinguish between transient Ca2+ signals that induce events such as muscle contraction , secretion , adhesion and synaptic transmission , and sustained Ca2+ signals that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation .
The latter class of events is blocked in lymphocytes by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 , which inhibit calcineurin , a Ca2+-activated serine/threonine phosphatase necessary for the nuclear import of NF-AT transcription factors .
Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2+ , but not transient pulses , are required to maintain NF-AT transcription factors in the nucleus , where they participate in Ca2+-dependent induction of genes required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation .
Furthermore , overexpression and constitutive nuclear localization of NF-AT , but not Jun , Fos , NF-kappaB , Oct or Ets family members , renders the interleukin-2 enhancer in Jurkat T lymphocytes resistant to FK506 and cyclosporin A .
Thus a primary effect of these immunosuppressive reagents is to control the subcellular localization of the NF-AT family of transcription factors .
Treatment of the acute promyelocytic ( APL ) cell line NB4 with interferon alpha ( IFN(alpha) ) , as well as IFN(beta) and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha ( RAR(alpha) ) and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor PML-RAR .
Transcriptional induction of the RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR mRNAs is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins .
Up-regulation of RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR gene expression by IFN(alpha) is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers , i.e. , granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor mRNA and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase .
However , IFN(alpha) does not have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33 .
The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells , since the phenomena are not observed in HL-60 promyelocytes .
Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells , although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity .
These results suggest the possible use of combinations between IFNs and retinoic acid in the cyto-differentiating treatment of APL patients .
A theoretical pathway of transcriptional regulation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene is via a cAMP response element ( CRE ) present in its promoter region ( -508 to -501 ) .
After 20 h of stimulation with 8-bromo-cAMP , AR mRNA was upregulated in LNCaP but not in either PC-3 or DU-145 cell lines .
We have demonstrated that the level of CRE binding protein ( CREB ) was the same in all cell lines and that the putative AR-CRE forms specific and compatible protein interactions with CREB .
The ability to regulate AR gene transcription via the second messenger pathway is lost in the PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines .
This may be an important primary mechanism of androgen insensitivity in prostate cancer .
To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) in non-monocytic cells , we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments .
We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes .
By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift , transcription factor SP-1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element .
The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif .
Mutation of this motif almost completely , and specifically , abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95 % decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta ( -170/+108 ) .
Likewise , activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site .
These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes .
BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids are important medications used to control the airway inflammation associated with asthma .
Synthetic glucocorticoids vary in their binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) .
METHODS : We compared hydrocortisone , beclomethasone dipropionate , triamcinolone acetonide , flunisolide , and budesonide with regard to their capacity to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation from six patients with steroid-sensitive asthma and seven patients with steroid-resistant asthma .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell GCR binding affinities for dexamethasone and budesonide were also determined for both patient groups by using a radioligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis .
RESULTS : Dose-dependent inhibition was demonstrated for all glucocorticoids in both patient groups , with the steroid-resistant group requiring approximately 2 log-fold more glucocorticoids for an equivalent degree of inhibition .
The mean concentrations necessary to cause 50 % inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50s ) for the steroid-sensitive group ranged from 2 x 10(-10) mol/L for budesonide to 7 x 10(-8) mol/L for hydrocortisone , whereas the mean IC50s for the steroid-resistant group ranged from approximately 2 x 10(-8) mol/L for budesonide to greater than 10(-6) mol/L for hydrocortisone .
In addition , a significant correlation was noted between the degree of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50 ) and the binding affinity of dexamethasone to the GCR .
Patients with steroid-resistant asthma have been shown to have a reduced GCR binding affinity .
The GCR binding affinity for budesonide was significantly higher in both groups ( i.e. , lower dissociation constant ) than that obtained for dexamethasone .
CONCLUSION : These data suggest that glucocorticoids such as budesonide , by virtue of their high GCR binding affinities and greater ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation , may therefore be beneficial in the management of difficult-to-control asthma .
Aging is classically accompanied by a dysregulation of the immunologic machinery .
As a consequence , the immune response developed in senescent organisms is usually inappropriate , often inefficient , sometimes aberrant , and potentially detrimental .
The age-associated immune dysfunction may be implicated to some degree in the extreme susceptibility of the elderly to infection and neoplasia and may even participate in various aspects of senescence .
The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence is still fragmentary .
The most extensively studied phenomenon is the progressive decline in the proliferative capacities of T lymphocytes with aging .
The loss of proliferative potential in response to antigenic challenge is a characteristic feature of immune senescence .
It is directly implicated in the emergence of the age-related immune deficiency .
The purpose of this review is to show how the accumulation of various biochemical lesions with advancing age leads to the failure of a critical cell function , namely the activation-induced lymphocyte proliferation .
The biochemical modifications responsible for the defect in transduction and execution of the proliferative signal are analyzed as a function of age .
The multiple alterations observed on the various biochemical pathways may appear as a consequence of a unique deleterious mechanism more fundamentally related to the process of senescence such as the inability to cope with oxidative stress .
Inhibition of apoptosis in eosinophils by cytokines such as IL-5 and GM-CSF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic and parasitic disorders .
Recently , there has been some progress in the understanding of the signal transduction pathways activated by these cytokines in eosinophils .
The IL-3 , IL-5 and GM-CSF receptors share a common signal transducer that possesses no intrinsic kinase domain .
It has been shown that eosinophil stimulation by these cytokines is associated with increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates .
In the past few years , there has been some progress in defining the tyrosine kinases that are activated by the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor beta-subunit in eosinophils .
This review will concentrate on this topic and on its role for the regulation of eosinophil apoptosis .
The caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is activated by gamma interferon ( IFN-gamma ) in promonocytic cells .
We have previously shown that a 70-bp element is necessary and sufficient for the response of the CAEV LTR to this cytokine .
At the 5' end , this 70-bp IFN-gamma response element contains sequence similarity to the gamma activated site ( GAS ) .
Here we demonstrate that the putative GAS element in the CAEV LTR binds specifically to a cellular factor induced by IFN-gamma in promonocytic cells .
Substitution mutations in this consensus sequence eliminate binding of the inducible factor .
The GAS element from the 70-bp motif is sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN-gamma using a heterologous minimal promoter .
Consistent with the binding data , the same mutations in the GAS element eliminate responsiveness to IFN-gamma in the context of both a functional CAEV LTR and a heterologous promoter .
The cellular factor that binds to the GAS element is present from 5 min to 14 h after stimulation with IFN-gamma .
Binding of the nuclear factor to the GAS element in the CAEV LTR is inhibited by antibody directed against STAT1 ( p91/84 ) .
Thus , the GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR is essential for the response to IFN-gamma and a STAT1-like factor binds to this site .
The STAT-1 signaling pathway provides at least one mechanism for activation of the CAEV LTR by IFN-gamma in monocytes .
These data are the first demonstration of a role for a STAT family member in the regulation of a viral promoter .
We have set out to test a model for tissue-specific gene expression that relies on the early replication of expressed genes to sequester limiting activating transcription factors .
Using an erythroid cell line , we have tested the changes in the DNA binding activity of the lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 through the cell cycle .
We find that GATA-1 activity is low in G1 , peaks in mid-S phase , and then decreases in G2/M .
In contrast , the binding activities of two ubiquitous transcription factors , Oct1 and Sp1 , remain high in G2/M .
GATA-1 protein and mRNA vary in a similar manner through the cell cycle , suggesting that the expression of the gene or the stability of its message is regulated .
Although a number of transcription factors involved in the control of the cell cycle or DNA replication have been shown to peak in S phase , this is the first example of a lineage-restricted transcription factor displaying S phase-specific DNA binding activity .
One interpretation of these data leads to a model in which the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding amplifies the effect of early replication on the activation of erythroid-specific genes at the same time as preventing activation of non-erythroid genes containing GATA-responsive elements .
These results may also relate to recent data implicating GATA-1 function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression .
Rhombotin-2 ( RBTN-2 ) is a proto-oncogene only in the context of T lymphocytes .
We postulated that the oncogenic effect of RBTN-2 in T cells is likely mediated by binding protein ( s ) with T cell-specific expression .
By screening a T cell cDNA library , we identified a novel ets transcription factor that binds RBTN-2 .
This protein was named elf-2 because its DNA-binding domain is virtually identical to that of ets family member elf-1 .
Northern analyses showed similar levels of two elf-2 transcripts ( 3.5 kb and 3.8 kb ) in all tissues except thymus .
Thymocytes expressed four- to 10-fold greater amounts of the 3.5 kb transcript than other tissues .
Sequence analyses of cDNA clones indicated that these transcripts encode proteins differing only at their amino termini , and likely represent alternatively spliced isoforms .
These isoforms ( elf-2a and elf-2b ) contain identical RBTN-2 binding regions and DNA-binding domains .
Elf-2b lacks a putative transactivation domain .
The expression patterns suggest that RBTN-2 normally interacts equally with elf-2a and elf-2b .
In contrast , when RBTN-2 is inappropriately expressed in T cells , RBTN-2 would interact predominantly with elf-2b ; this interaction may lead to T cell proliferation .
Monoclonal anti-D antibodies submitted to the Third Monoclonal International Workshop were evaluated against a number of D variant cells using standard serological techniques .
The monoclonal antibodies were able to discriminate between the cells of Categories Va , VI and DFR but not Category III cells .
Cells within each category did not give any aberrant results .
The Rh : 33 cells behaved as normal Rh ( D ) positive cells .
Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) is a 130-kD member of the Ig gene superfamily that is expressed on platelets , endothelial cells , and certain leukocyte subsets .
To examine the factors controlling vascular-specific expression of PECAM-1 , we cloned the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene and analyzed its transcriptional activity .
5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 5'-RACE ) analysis showed that transcription initiation occurred at several closely spaced nearby sites originating approximately 204 bp upstream from the translation start site .
Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream from the transcription initiation site ( TIS ) showed no canonical TATA or CAAT elements , however an initiator element commonly found in TATA-less promoters encompassed the TIS .
5'-serially truncated PECAM-1 promoter segments cloned in front of a luciferase reporter drove transcription in both a lineage- and orientation-specific manner .
Putative cis-acting control elements present within a 300-bp core promoter included two ets sites , an Sp1 site , tandem E-box domains , two GATA-associated sites ( CACCC ) , an AP-2 binding site , and a GATA element at -24 .
Mutational analysis showed that optimal transcriptional activity required the GATA sequence at position -24 , and gel-shift assays further showed that the GATA-2 transcription factor , but not GATA-1 , bound to this region of the PECAM-1 promoter .
Understanding the cis- and transacting factors that regulate the tissue-specific expression of PECAM-1 should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which vascular-specific gene expression is achieved .
Currently available data indicate that erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other , and there may exist progenitor cells common to those two lineages may exist .
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML-M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .
These blast cells express lineage-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid-specific mRNAs such as gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS-E ) , indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .
These results suggest that blasts in M7 and TMD may correspond to progenitors of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates more efficiently in vitro in differentiated macrophages than in freshly isolated monocytes .
We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of NF-kappaB with monocyte differentiation .
We demonstrated that constitutive expression of NF-kappaB in primary human monocytes changed significantly with differentiation in vitro to monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) and differentiation in vivo to alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) .
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively expressed high levels of transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer which decreased with time in culture in favor of the transcriptionally active p50/p65 and p50/RelB heterodimers .
As in MDMs , AMs constitutively expressed p50/p65 and p50/RelB although at lower levels .
HIV infection of fresh monocytes failed to induce p50/p65 as seen in MDMs .
The replacement of p50 homodimers with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection during in vitro culture .
The change in NF-kappaB components with monocyte differentiation in vivo may also explain the different transcriptional activities of these cell populations in HIV-infected individuals .
We analyzed the activity of the enhancer , the promoter and the silencer of the human CD4 gene during T cell development using transgenic mice .
Immunofluorescence studies on thymic populations of mice carrying transgenes in various combinations of these regulatory DNA elements revealed that thymocytes control the CD4 gene in a different manner than mature peripheral T lymphocytes .
The 5'-positive regulatory unit , consisting of the promoter and the 5' enhancer , is already active at the CD4-CD8-double-negative ( DN ) stage of development .
However , its activity becomes lower in the double-positive and a fraction of the CD4+ CD8int/- cell population , indicating that an additional enhancer , located in either the first or the third intron of the CD4 gene , is required for CD4 gene expression in this population .
The other studied regulatory element is the minimal CD4 silencer which inhibits CD4 gene expression in peripheral CD8 T lymphocytes .
This silencer is inactive in the most immature DN thymocytes , which probably use a distinct silencer mechanism to down-regulate CD4 gene expression .
Unexpectedly , the CD4 silencer is also active in CD4+ CD8int/- cells of the thymus , implying that an anti-silencer may be required to resume CD4 expression in this cell population .
Altogether , the CD4 gene is regulated by several positive and negative regulatory mechanisms which come into play in a developmentally coordinated manner .
Heat-shock for 2 hours at 42 degrees C , or the administration for 3 hours of 100 or 150 microM cadmium chloride , inhibited the subsequent proliferation activity , induced the expression of functional differentiation markers , and caused an increase in the amount of the stress-responsive HSP70 protein in U-937 human promonocytic cells .
In addition , both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the intermediate filament protein vimentin , as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays .
By contrast , the amounts of actin and beta-tubulin were not significantly altered .
The amount of vimentin mRNA was also increased during recovery from stress , indicating that vimentin expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level .
Although cadmium caused an early , transient stimulation of c-jun and c-fos expression and AP-1 binding activity , heat-shock failed to alter both protooncogene expression and transcription factor binding , indicating that the stress-induced vimentin increase was not the result of AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation .
Finally , it was observed that the rate of decay of vimentin mRNA upon actinomycin D administration was decreased in heat- and cadmium-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells .
These results indicate that stress treatments cause an increase in vimentin levels in promonocytic cells , which may be explained at least in part by transcript stabilization .
The Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , and Fes tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to interleukin ( IL ) -4 stimulation in different cell systems .
However , it is not clear which , if any , of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates in vivo .
In the present study , we have utilized a mutant Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line , E1C3 , and its parental Jak1-expressing counterpart , 1D4 , to analyze the role of Jak1 in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events .
IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) -1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells .
IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was pronounced in 1D4 cells , while no IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation was detected in E1C3 cells .
IL-4 also induced Stat6 DNA binding activity from lysates of 1D4 but not E1C3 cells utilizing a radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline epsilon promotor sequence ( Iepsilon ) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Reconstitution of Jak1 expression in E1C3 cells restored the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation .
These results provide evidence that Jak1 expression is required for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of crucial molecules involved in IL-4 signal transduction .
Interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1beta ) is one of the most important inflammatory mediators in human inflammatory and immunological diseases .
The regulation of human IL-1beta gene expression has been studied for several years , and a few regulatory elements have been discovered in the promoter region .
However , little is known about negative regulation of IL-1beta expression at the transcriptional level , which may play an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects .
We have identified a negative regulatory element located in the region between -685 and -395 .
Within this region , a 19-bp nuclear factor binding site ( -570 to -552 ) was characterized by DNase I footprinting and electromobility shift assay .
A consensus sequence for a negative glucocorticoid response element ( nGRE ) and a transcription activator protein-2 binding site were noted within this footprint .
Functional studies showed a 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity when this 19-bp binding site was deleted in the reporter constructs IL-1beta/CAT and IL-1beta/SV40 promoter/CAT .
Dexamethasone ( 10(-8) M ) repressed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) production by 75 % in the wild-type fragment but not in a deletion mutant lacking the 19-bp site .
A protein of about 150 kD that bound to this negative regulatory sequence was identified by UV cross-linking .
This is the first description of a negative regulatory region responsive to glucocorticoids in a cytokine gene .
A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , designated TRAMP , has been identified .
The structural organization of the 393 amino acid long human TRAMP is most homologous to TNF receptor 1 .
TRAMP is abundantly expressed on thymocytes and lymphocytes .
Its extracellular domain is composed of four cysteine-rich domains , and the cytoplasmic region contains a death domain known to signal apoptosis .
Overexpression of TRAMP leads to two major responses , NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis .
TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases , but not by Bcl-2 .
In addition , TRAMP does not appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family .
The E2F family of transcription factors are thought to play an important role in the control of cell cycle progression .
There is now also increasing evidence that some family members may act as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes .
The characterization of these proteins in human primary haemopoietic cells and acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) blasts may thus give an insight to the molecular mechanisms governing proliferation and leukaemogenesis in these cells .
Therefore we analysed the expression of E2F-DNA binding activity and the constituent proteins found in the complexes in human primary haemopoietic cells of various lineages .
We also studied blasts from 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) .
On electromobility shift assays ( EMSA ) a single E2F-DNA binding complex was detected in T cells , B cells and monocytes which was shown to contain E2F-4 , DP-1 and p130 , indicating that all quiescent haemopoietic cells have the same complex .
Examination of 18 AML samples by EMSA revealed the presence of E2F binding and no gross abnormalities were detected .
An E2F-4/p130 complex was detected in representative samples of all FAB types analysed .
Thus abnormalities of E2F function are unlikely to play a primary pathogenic role in AML .
BACKGROUND : The reduction of symptoms due to treatment with corticosteroids varies among patients with perennial rhinitis .
Most patients will respond but a few patients respond less to these drugs .
OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association in reduction of symptoms due to glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptor characteristics in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis , in vitro glucocorticoid receptor binding studies were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells using dexamethasone and in vitro production of mediators were measured .
METHODS : During a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study , 200 micrograms fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray ( in the active treatment period ) and placebo ( in the placebo treatment period ) were administered twice daily for 2 weeks to 22 patients allergic to house dust mite .
At the end of both treatment periods symptoms were scored after allergen provocation ( 100 , 1000 , 10000 BU/mL ) and during the 9.5 hours after this challenge .
Receptor binding studies with dexamethasone were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Leukotriene B4 produced by monocytes in vitro and soluble interleukin-2 receptor released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels in plasma were determined .
RESULTS : No significant partial correlations of the number of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors ( 6821 +/- 5669 binding sites per cell ) and the affinity ( Kd : 16.5 +/- 13.51 nmol/L ) for the glucocorticoid receptors with the symptom score ( placebo : 4.3 +/- 2.45 pts ; fluticasone : 2.4 +/- 1.55 pts ) after active treatment were found .
Also no significant partial correlations of the levels of leukotriene B4 ( 45.6 +/- 105.3 ng/10(6) cells ) produced by monocytes in vitro , soluble interleukin-2 receptor ( 734 +/- 237 ng/10(6) cells ) released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels ( 571 +/- 236 ng/mL ) in plasma with the symptom score after active treatment were found .
CONCLUSIONS : The reduction of symptoms due to topical fluticasone propionate in patients with rhinitis and allergy to house dust mite is not correlated with the characteristics of the glucocorticoid receptor .
LR1 is a B cell-specific , sequence-specific DNA binding activity that regulates transcription in activated B cells .
LR1 also binds Ig heavy chain switch region sequences and may function in class switch recombination .
LR1 contains two polypeptides , of 106 kDa and 45 kDa , and here we report that the 106-kDa component of LR1 is nucleolin .
This identification , initially made by microsequence analysis , was verified by showing that ( i ) LR1-DNA binding activity increased in B cells transfected with a nucleolin cDNA expression construct ; ( ii ) LR1-DNA binding activity was recognized by antibodies raised against recombinant human nucleolin ; and ( iii ) in B cells transfected with epitope-tagged nucleolin expression constructs , the LR1-DNA complex was recognized by the anti-tag antibody .
Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein which is believed to play a role in rDNA transcription or organization , or rRNA processing .
Homology between nucleolin and histone H1 suggests that nucleolin may alter DNA organization in response to cell cycle controls , and the nucleolin component of LR1 may therefore function to organize switch regions before , during , or after switch recombination .
The demonstration that nucleolin is a component of a B cell-specific complex that binds switch region sequences suggests that the G-rich switch regions may have evolved from rDNA .
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) have long been used as the most effective agents for the treatment of allergic diseases accompanied by eosinophilia such as chronic asthma and atopic dermatitis .
The development of chronic eosinophilic inflammation is dependent on interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , a selective eosinophil-activating factor , produced by helper T cells .
To delineate the regulatory mechanisms of human IL-5 synthesis , we established allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from asthmatic patients .
GC efficiently suppressed IL-5 synthesis of T-cell clones activated via either T-cell receptor ( TCR ) or IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) .
Induction of IL-5 mRNA upon TCR and IL-2R stimulation was totally inhibited by dexamethasone .
Human IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct transfected to T-cell clones was transcribed on either TCR or IL-2R stimulation and was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , indicating that the approximately 500-bp human IL-5 gene segment located 5' upstream of the coding region contains activation-inducible enhancer elements responsible for the regulation by GC .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis suggested that AP-1 and NF-kappaB are among the possible targets of GC actions on TCR-stimulated T cells .
NF-AT and NF-kappaB were not significantly induced by IL-2 stimulation .
Our results showing that GC suppressed IL-5 production by human CD4+ T cells activated by two distinct stimuli , TCR and IL-2R stimulation , underscore the efficacy of GC in the treatment of allergic diseases via suppression of T-cell IL-5 synthesis .
We have previously demonstrated that experimental expression of the polyomavirus transcription factor T-antigen has the potential to induce anti-DNA antibodies in mice .
Two sets of independent evidences are presented here that demonstrate a biological relevance for this model .
First , we describe results demonstrating that mice inoculated with T-antigen-expressing plasmids produced antibodies , not only to T-antigen and DNA , but also to the DNA-binding eukaryotic transcription factors TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) , and to the cAMP-response-element-binding protein ( CREB ) .
Secondly , we investigated whether polyomavirus reactivation occurs in SLE patients , and whether antibodies to T-antigen , DNA , and to TBP and CREB are linked to such events .
Both within and among these SLE patients , frequent polyomavirus reactivations were observed that could not be explained by certain rearrangements of the noncoding control regions , nor by corticosteroid treatment .
Linked to these events , antibodies to T-antigen , DNA , TBP , and CREB were detected , identical to what we observed in mice .
Antibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA were confined to patients with frequent polyomavirus reactivations .
The results described here indicate that cognate interaction of B cells recognizing DNA or DNA-associated proteins and T cells recognizing T antigen had taken place as a consequence of complex formation between T ag and DNA in vivo in the context of polyomavirus reactivations .
Truncated forms of the NOTCH1 transmembrane receptor engineered to resemble mutant forms of NOTCH1 found in certain cases of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( T-ALL ) efficiently induce T-ALL when expressed in the bone marrow of mice .
Unlike full-sized NOTCH1 , two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain ( DeltaE ) or consisting only of the intracellular domain ( ICN ) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells , presumably through RBP-Jkappa response elements within DNA .
Both truncated forms also bound to the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa in extracts prepared from human and murine T-ALL cell lines .
Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak RBP-Jkappa-binding site within the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain .
Unexpectedly , a second , stronger RBP-Jkappa-binding site , which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-Jkappa , was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation .
While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus , DeltaE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , suggesting that intranuclear localization is not essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation .
In support of this interpretation , mutation of putative nuclear localization sequences decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by membrane-bound DeltaE .
Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of membrane-bound DeltaE was approximately equivalent to that produced by intranuclear ICN .
These data are most consistent with NOTCH1 oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with RBP-Jkappa at promoter sites .
NFAT proteins constitute a family of transcription factors involved in mediating signal transduction .
Using a panel of specific antisera in immunoprecipitation assays , we found that NFATp ( 135 kDa ) is constitutively expressed in normal human T cells , while synthesis of NFATc ( predominant form of 86 kDa ) is induced by ionomycin treatment .
NFAT4/x was very weakly expressed in unstimulated cells , and its level did not increase upon treatment with activating agents .
NFAT3 protein was not observed under any conditions .
Higher-molecular-weight species of NFATc ( of 110 and 140 kDa ) were also detected .
In addition , translation of NFATc mRNA apparently initiates at two different AUG codons , giving rise to proteins that differ in size by 36 amino acids .
Additional size heterogeneity of both NFATc and NFATp results from phosphorylation .
In contrast to ionomycin treatment , exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus anti-CD28 did not induce NFATc , indicating that under these conditions , interleukin-2 synthesis by these cells is apparently independent of NFATc .
In DNA binding assays , both PMA plus anti-CD28 and PMA plus ionomycin resulted in nuclear NFAT .
Surprisingly , the PMA-ionomycin-induced synthesis of NFATc that was detected by immunoprecipitation was not mirrored in the DNA binding assays : nearly all of the activity was due to NFATp .
This is the first study of expression of all family members at the protein level in normal human T cells .
Recent studies have revealed that interactions between transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells .
To isolate cDNA clones that dominantly inhibit the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2 , chosen as a representative factor , we have developed a novel screening system .
This employs an Escherichia coli tester strain carrying a modified lac operon as a reporter gene , with the lac operator sequence replaced by an octamer sequence .
Oct-2 expressed in this tester strain represses the expression of the reporter gene and changes the phenotype of the cell from Lac+ to Lac- .
Introduction of a cDNA expression library prepared from a human T-cell line into the Oct-2-harboring tester strain allowed selection of three Lac+ clones out of 1 x 10(5) transformants .
One of them , hT86 , encoding a putative zinc finger protein was found to derepress beta-galactosidase activity in the Oct-2-harboring tester strain at the transcriptional level .
In gel mobility shift assays , hT86 attenuated the intensity of the retarded band composed of the octamer probe and Oct-2 , suggesting a dominant negative effect on the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2 .
The strategy described here provides a new approach for studying protein-protein interactions that govern the complex regulation of gene expression .
BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms during T-cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response .
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function , including the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , the costimulatory receptor CD28 , and negative regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4 .
PI 3-kinase is also regulated by the haematopoietic cytokines that determine T-cell differentiation and lymphocyte proliferation .
PI 3-kinase can thus dynamically influence the outcome of the immune reactions at various stages .
In this study , we investigated the importance of PI 3-kinase in TCR-directed T-cell activation using activated or inhibitory versions of PI 3-kinase .
RESULTS : Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were not affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase .
We found , however , that PI 3-kinase profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of ' nuclear factor of activated T cells ' ( NF-AT ) elicited by the TCR : expression of an activated form of PI 3-kinase inhibited TCR-mediated NF-AT responses , whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase potently enhanced TCR-controlled NF-AT induction .
These effects of PI 3-kinase were not mediated by previously identified PI 3-kinase effectors , such as protein kinase B , a positive regulator of PI 3-kinase , or the GTPase Rac , and are therefore likely to involve a novel , as yet unknown , effector molecule .
CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish that PI 3-kinase can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function , and uncover a previously unrecognized function for PI 3-kinase in T cells as a selective negative regulator of TCR-signalling events and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis .
In this report , we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV , LAI , does not replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated by cross-linking CD3 and CD28 .
In contrast , LAI replicates well in memory CD4 T cells stimulated in the same way .
Unlike this physiologically relevant stimulation , PHA stimulates productive LAI replication in both naive and memory T cells .
These studies were conducted with highly purified ( FACS-isolated ) subsets of CD4 T cells identified by expression of both CD45RA and CD62L .
Remixing of purified T cells showed that naive T cells do not suppress LAI replication in memory T cells and that memory T cells do not restore LAI expression in naive T cells .
The suppression of productive LAI replication in naive T cells is not due to differential expression of viral coreceptors , nor is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV transcription factors , nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 .
The inherent resistance of naive T cells to productive HIV infection , coupled with their proliferative advantage as demonstrated here , provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of CD4 T cells from HIV-infected adults .
Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells , plays a crucial role in regulating interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production and in the generation of IFN-gamma-producing T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells .
Here we show that the IL-12 receptor ( IL-12R ) beta 2 subunit , a recently cloned binding and signal transducing component of the IL-12R , is expressed on human Th1 but not Th2 clones and is induced during differentiation of human naive cells along the Th1 but not the Th2 pathway .
IL-12 and type I but not type II interferons induce expression of the IL-12R beta 2 chain during in vitro T cell differentiation after antigen receptor triggering .
The selective expression and regulation of the IL-12R beta 2 subunit may help to understand the basis of Th1/Th2 differentiation and may provide therapeutic options for altering the Th1/Th2 balance in several immuno-pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies .
The two related protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and Zap are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and enzymatically activated upon crosslinking of the T cell antigen receptor .
We have previously reported that the activation of Syk is less dependent on the Src family kinase Lck than the activation of Zap .
Here we report that overexpression of Syk in the Lck-negative JCaM1 cells enabled the T cell antigen receptor/CD3 complex to induce a normal activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway and expression of a nuclear factor of activated T cells reporter construct .
In contrast , Zap and other protein-tyrosine kinases were unable to reconstitute these signaling pathways when expressed at the same levels .
In parallel , Syk was phosphorylated on tyrosine , while Zap was not .
The Syk-mediated T cell antigen receptor-induced MAPK activation was detectable within 1 min of receptor stimulation and peaked at 3-5 min .
The capacity of Syk to reconstitute the MAPK response required the catalytic activity of Syk , an intact autophosphorylation site ( Y518 and Y519 ) , both Src homology 2 domains and it was blocked by the inhibitory N17-mutated dominant-negative Ras construct .
A Y341 --> F mutant of Syk , which is deficient in its interaction with phospholipase Cy1 and Vav , was less efficient than wild-type Syk .
Our results suggest that Syk , in contrast to Zap , can transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor independently of Lck .
Activated neutrophils have the ability to upregulate the expression of many genes , in particular those encoding cytokines and chemokines , and to subsequently release the corresponding proteins .
Although little is known to date concerning the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , it is noteworthy that many of these genes depend on the activation of transcription factors , such as NF-kappaB , for inducible expression .
We therefore investigated whether NF-kappaB/Rel proteins are expressed in human neutrophils , as well as their fate on cell activation .
We now report that dimers consisting of p50 NFkappaB1 , p65 RelA , and/or c-Rel are present in neutrophils and that the greater part of these protein complexes is physically associated with cytoplasmic IkappaB-alpha in resting cells .
Following neutrophil stimulation with proinflammatory agonists ( such as lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] , tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNF-alpha ] , and fMet-Leu-Phe ) that induce the production of cytokines and chemokines in these cells , NF-kappaB/Rel proteins translocated to nuclear fractions , resulting in a transient induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity , as determined in gel mobility shift assays .
The onset of both processes was found to be closely paralleled by , and dependent on , IkappaB-alpha degradation .
Proinflammatory neutrophil stimuli also promoted the accumulation of IkappaB-alpha mRNA transcripts , resulting in the reexpression of the IkappaB-alpha protein .
To our knowledge , this constitutes the first indication that NF-kappaB activation may underlie the action of proinflammatory stimuli towards human neutrophil gene expression and , as such , adds a new facet to our understanding of neutrophil biology .
We investigated the functional role of Itk , a member of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Tec family , in T cell activation .
Stimulation of either CD2 or T cell receptor ( TCR ) /CD3 on Tcells by monoclonal antibody-mediated cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk , which was maximal as early as 1 min after stimulation .
The tyrosine kinase activity in the anti-Itk immunoprecipitate was significantly activated upon these stimulations .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of CD2 , TCR/CD3 , and CD28 with antibodies was significantly reduced by transient expression of an Itk mutant lacking the kinase activity .
The reduction paralleled a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous wild-type Itk .
Stimulation of CD2 or TCR/CD3 induced activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , the binding site of which is included in the IL-2 gene promoter .
The activation of NFAT was also impaired by expression of the Itk mutant .
These results demonstrate that Itk plays a role in IL-2 production , indicating a critical involvement of Itk in the initial stage of T cell activation by mediating signals from the TCR/CD3 complex , CD2 , and CD28 .
DNA methylation changes are among the most common detectable abnormalities in human neoplasia .
Hypermethylation within the promoters of selected genes appears to be especially common in all types of human hematopoietic neoplasms , and is usually associated with inactivation of the involved gene ( s ) .
Such hypermethylation-associated silencing of gene expression has been shown for several genes regulating the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells , including the estrogen receptor ( ER ) gene , P15 , P16 and others .
Hypermethylation within the promoters of some genes appear to be an early event in the pathogenesis of neoplasia ( ER , P15 ) , while other genes seem to become methylated during the progression of leukemias ( HIC1 , c-abl ) .
The high prevalence of promoter methylation suggests that this molecular abnormality can be used to monitor disease activity during therapy .
In addition , new technology allows the sensitive identification of gene hypermethylation in a background of normal cells , suggesting possible new strategies for the detection of minimal residual disease .
Finally , reactivation of tumor-suppressor gene expression through pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and resultant DNA demethylation appears to be a promising new avenue of therapy in acute leukemia .
CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival , growth , differentiation , and isotype switching of B lymphocytes .
Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation , which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events .
We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3 .
Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40 , and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40 .
Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23 , ICAM-1 , and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells .
These results indicate that signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions .
Adenovirus can establish persistent infections which may reactivate and cause disease in immunocompromised hosts .
Lymphocytes have been postulated to serve as a site of adenoviral persistence based upon the ability to isolate adenovirus from tonsils and to detect adenovirus DNA by Southern blot hybridization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
To test this hypothesis , a more sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay was developed to detect adenovirus DNA .
Two sets of nested primers were designed to conserved sequences in the adenovirus E1A and hexon genes .
The E1A and hexon primers amplified DNA from representative adenoviral serotypes in all six adenoviral groups ( A-F ) .
Both primers detected a single copy of the adenovirus type 2 genome but were less sensitive for the group B type 35 .
None of 33 PBMC specimens from healthy adults and only one of 40 pediatric samples was positive ( at a low level ) for adenovirus DNA by nested PCR assay .
In comparison , PBMC from two children with fatal adenoviral infection were both strongly positive for adenovirus DNA .
It is concluded that , in contrast to a previous study , PBMC are not a common site of persistent group C adenoviral infection .
In addition , assay of PBMC by the adenovirus-specific PCR may help detect early invasive disease and warrants further evaluation .
Stimulation of mature peripheral T cells by TCR engagement results in activation of signals that drive induction of cytokine gene expression and clonal expansion .
However , under some conditions , engagement of the TCR leads instead to apoptosis .
Recent studies demonstrate that TCR-stimulated apoptosis requires expression of CD95 ligand on activated T cells followed by an interaction between CD95 ligand and the CD95 receptor also expressed on this population .
The experiments reported in this study were designed to address the signaling events triggered by TCR engagement that are important for regulating CD95 ligand gene expression .
To approach this , we generated a luciferase reporter construct containing elements of the CD95 ligand promoter .
Using a previously described mutant of the Jurkat T cell line , we show that proximal signaling events dependent on the presence of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase are required for TCR-stimulated CD95 ligand expression .
Transient transfection studies demonstrate further that TCR-stimulated activation of the Ras signaling pathway is required for optimal activation of CD95 ligand .
Next , in an effort to determine critical transcription factors that regulate CD95 ligand expression , we demonstrate a cyclosporin A-sensitive nuclear factor-AT response element in the promoter region of this gene that is critical for optimal CD95 ligand reporter activity in stimulated T cells .
Together , these studies begin a dissection of the biochemical events that lead to expression of CD95 ligand , a required step for TCR-induced apoptosis .
We isolated a new mouse gene that is highly expressed in thymocytes , testis , and brain .
This gene , SRG3 , showed a significant sequence homology to SWI3 , a yeast transcriptional activator , and its human homolog BAF155 .
SRG3 encodes 1,100 amino acids and has 33-47 % identity with SWI3 protein over three regions .
The SRG3 protein contains an acidic NH2 terminus , a myb-like DNA binding domain , a leucine-zipper motif , and a proline- and glutamine-rich region at its COOH terminus .
Rabbit antiserum raised against a COOH-terminal polypeptide of the SRG3 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD .
The serum also detected a 170-kD protein that seems to be a mouse homologue of human BAF170 .
Immunoprecipitation of cell extract with the antiserum against the mouse SRG3 also brought down a 195-kD protein that could be recognized by an antiserum raised against human SWI2 protein .
The results suggest that the SRG3 protein associates with a mouse SWI2 .
The SRG3 protein is expressed about three times higher in thymocytes than in peripheral lymphocytes .
The expression of anti-sense RNA to SRG3 mRNA in a thymoma cell line , S49.1 , reduced the expression level of the SRG3 protein , and decreased the apoptotic cell death induced by glucocorticoids .
These results suggest that the SRG3 protein is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the thymoma cell line .
This implicates that the SRG3 may play an important regulatory role during T cell development in thymus .
Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is an important B-cell growth and differentiation factor .
IL-6 treatment of the human lymphoblastoid cell line , SKW6.4 , leads to increased IgM production .
We have previously shown that IL-6 induces activation of JAK1 and JAK2 in human B cell lines .
A chimeric IL-6 receptor , comprised of the intracellular tail of the IL-6 receptor subunit gp130 fused to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor , was stably transfected into SKW6.4 cells .
EGF treatment induced IgM production in cells transfected with an intact gp130 cytoplasmic tail , but not in untransfected cells or cells transfected with a cytoplasmic tail lacking all four signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) binding sites .
Moreover , EGF treatment induced Stat3 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the intact chimeric EGF-gp130 receptor along with induction of DNA-mobility shift of a classical interferon-gamma-activated site .
To define further the relation between Stat3 activation and enhanced IgM production , we determined the effect of chimeric gp130 on the transcriptional activation of a genetic element linked to immunoglobulin production , namely the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( IgH-enhancer ) .
Parental as well as transfected SKW6.4 cells were transiently transfected with an IgH-enhancer-luciferase construct .
The transcriptional activity of the IgH-luciferase construct was induced upon ligation of the full-length chimeric receptor but not by truncated gp130 receptors .
Moreover , the gp130-induced activity of this reporter gene was abrogated by Stat3EE , a mutant Stat3 incapable of binding DNA .
These results indicate that IL-6-induced B-cell differentiation , as measured by IgM production , may be controlled by Stat3 proteins .
The role of cellular redox status in both cytotoxic activity and NF-kappa B activation in natural killer ( NK ) cells was investigated .
The results indicate that stimulation of NK cells , either freshly isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) or long-term cultured NK clones , with specific cell targets results in an increased binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 transcription factors measured by gel retardation .
Pretreatment of NK cells with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbarmate ( PDTC ) leads to the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation but the AP-1 binding to DNA was superinduced .
The inhibition of NF-kappa B by PDTC paralleled with an inhibition of spontaneous cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells .
Moreover , the inhibitors of serine proteases , N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone , also blocked the cytolytic activity of NK cells against the sensitive target K562 .
In contrast , NK activity was not affected by pretreatment of the effector cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal which selectively inhibits NF-kappa B activation .
Altogether , these results support the hypothesis that the activation of NK cells involved transcriptional and post-transcriptional events , and that reactive intermediates may play an important role in the molecular processes related with the generation of a cytotoxic response by NK cells .
To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of binding to the human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) , we developed a new monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) raised against the hormone-binding domain ( HBD ) .
For this purpose , mice were immunized with a fusion protein including the sequence Thr729-Lys984 of hMR .
After ELISA screening , mAb 18C7 was selected for its specificity towards the HBD .
This antibody recognized both the denatured and native MR forms , as well as the hetero-oligomeric MR form and the transformed MR state .
By using several HBD subfragments , the mAb 18C7 epitope was located in the N-terminal region of the HBD from Thr729 to Leu765 .
We then studied the effect of the antibody on aldosterone and progesterone binding to the hMR .
When 18C7 was incubated with liganded MR , it was able to partly displace ( 20 % ) the hormone from its binding site .
When 18C7 was incubated with MR before aldosterone or progesterone , the antibody inhibited 75-80 % of the binding .
The effect of 18C7 on the binding was similar with both hormones .
A sucrose gradient analysis indicated the simultaneous presence of two kinds of receptor complexes : the steroid-MR complex and the antibody-MR complex .
After its associated proteins , especially the heat-shock protein hsp90 , had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate , 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor .
Our results indicated that the epitope recognized by 18C7 was directly implicated in hormone binding .
The lack of steroid binding of HBD mutants with the Thr729-Leu765 sequence deleted [ Jalaguier , Mesnier , Leger and Auzou ( 1996 ) J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Biol.57 , 43-50 ] supports this hypothesis .
Because of the similar behaviours of aldosterone and progesterone , we conclude that the N-terminal Thr729-Leu765 region of the HBD is similarly involved in the binding of both hormones .
The TCR alpha beta or -gamma delta chains bind the peptide ligand , whereas the associated CD3 delta epsilon gamma and TCR zeta subunits couple the TCR to intracellular signal transduction components .
Recently , several groups have described marked alterations in signal transduction elements in T cells from cancer patients or in mice bearing tumor for a few weeks ( > 26 days ) .
The sequence in which these alterations develop is unknown .
The aim of this study was to explore the kinetics of the development of alterations in signal transduction molecules ( TCR zeta chain , NF kappaB family proteins , and tyrosine kinase p56 ( lck ) ) in mice bearing MC38 colon adenocarcinoma .
The results demonstrate that alterations in NF kappaB family proteins , specifically the failure of p65 translocation to the nucleus , occur earlier and more frequently than the decrease in zeta-chain .
These defects are paralleled by an impaired ability to produce Th1 cytokines ( IL-2 and IFN-gamma ) .
These initial changes are followed by the eventual loss of TCR zeta chain and p56 ( lck ) and a marked decrease in cytotoxic function .
An increased rate of lysosomal degradation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the loss of zeta-chain .
Differentiation generally leads to cell cycle arrest .
Human leukemia HL60 cells respond to the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25D3 ) by expressing a number of markers of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and become arrested predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
We have recently reported a series ( A ) of 1,25D3-resistant variants of HL60 cells which proliferate in the presence of 1,25D3 and do not express differentiation markers ( Exp. Cell Res. 224 , 312 , 1996 ) .
We now describe another series ( B ) of such variants , which differ from A series cells grown in similar concentrations of 1,25D3 in that they express the CD14 antigen and nonspecific esterase , characteristic of the monocyte , while continuing to proliferate and they develop hypotetraploid DNA ( 4C ) content at higher concentrations of ambient 1,25D3 than the A series cells .
Cells in the B series with 4C DNA content ( 100B and 200B ) also differed from the A series 4C cells by the absence of DNA binding by the full-length Sp1 transcription factor .
However , B series cells resembled the A series cells in exhibiting faster growth rates than the parental HL60 cells and showed high levels of vitamin D receptor and retinoid receptor X proteins .
These results show that the initial steps in the 1,25D3 signaling pathway are intact in B series resistant cells and lead to the appearance of early markers of monocytic differentiation .
However , the progression to subsequent events which comprise terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest is halted during the adaptation to the presence of 1,25D3 in these cells .
Thus , the availability of these variant cells should provide a system for studying the link between differentiation and cell cycle arrest .
We have generated transgenic mice that express a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) specifically in thymic T cells .
The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity , although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens that are used to gauge T cell development .
Isolated thymic T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation .
When challenged with an activating stimulus such as alpha-CD3 or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore , the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
Reduction of IL-2 production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein , CREB , and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as Fos B that are required to transactivate the IL-2 promoter .
Because transgene expression was regulated by the proximal promoter of the murine lck gene and this promoter is inactivated in T cells that exit the thymus , the mutant hCaMKIV is not present in peripheral T cells .
Consequently , T lymphocytes present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above , demonstrating that the effects of the inactive CaMKIV on activation are reversible .
Our results suggest that CaMKIV may represent a physiologically relevant CREB kinase in T cells and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the thymus .
Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated , it is unlikely to include CREB phosphorylation .
CIITA is a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines .
Its N-terminal region is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a DNA binding domain .
We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation .
Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( TATA box binding protein ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in TBP known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors .
Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in TBP that in yeast is known to abolish VP16-mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected .
A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP-associated factor TAFII250 also failed to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain .
Certain interactions between TBP and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA-mediated transactivation to reach its full potential .
Finally , like VP16 , CIITA was able to stimulate elongation of transcription .
Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the human B-cell-specific CIITA is very similar to that mediated by the herpes virus transactivator VP16 in the ways that have been tested .
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) epsilon is a recently cloned member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin .
The human C/EBPepsilon gene is transcribed by two alternative promoters , Palpha and Pbeta .
A combination of differential splicing and alternative use of promoters generates four mRNA isoforms , of 2.6 kb and 1.3-1.5 kb in size .
These transcripts can encode three proteins of calculated molecular mass 32.2 kDa , 27.8 kDa , and 14.3 kDa .
Accordingly , Western blots with antibodies specific for the DNA-binding domain , that is common to all forms , identify multiple proteins .
C/EBPepsilon mRNA was greatly induced during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of human primary CD34(+) cells .
Retinoic acid treatment of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells for 24 hr induced C/EBPepsilon mRNA levels by 4-fold , while prolonged treatment gradually reduced mRNA expression to pretreatment levels .
Transient transfection experiments with expression vectors for two of the isoforms demonstrated that the 32.2-kDa protein is an activator of transcription of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter , while the 14.3-kDa protein is not .
Thus , C/EBPepsilon is regulated in a complex fashion and may play a role in the regulation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation .
Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific transcription factor that belongs to the ETS protein family .
It can bind to DNA target sequences within a variety of cytokine genes .
We demonstrate that Elf-1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus which is dependent on the presence of amino acids 86-265 .
Analysis of Gal4-Elf-1 fusion proteins revealed that the N-terminal 86 amino acids of Elf-1 contain a transcriptional activation domain , the activity of which is attenuated by an internal repression domain .
Furthermore , Elf-1 interacts specifically with the E74 target sequence and can stimulate transcription driven by the E74 site independent of mitogenic signaling .
Thus , Elf-1 is able to stimulate gene transcription which may be required for the development and activity of lymphocytes .
We examined the effects of histamine and its agonists on the expression of the c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes at the transcriptional and translational levels in the human promonocytic U937 cell line .
Histamine transiently increased cAMP and c-fos expression through H2 receptors .
Dibutyryl cAMP also increased c-fos mRNA and protein , and levels remained elevated even after 12 hr of treatment .
Dose-dependence studies using histamine and dimaprit showed that the EC50 values for cAMP production and c-fos increase were similar , suggesting that cAMP might be involved in c-fos induction via H2 receptors .
Furthermore , studies carried out using H7 , a protein kinase A/protein kinase C inhibitor , blocked c-fos induction , whereas no effect was observed with bisindolylmaleimide , a specific protein kinase C inhibitor .
No modification of c-myc expression could be detected on treatment with histamine or its analogues .
Nevertheless , dibutyryl cAMP induced a down-regulation of the levels of this proto-oncogene .
In addition , dibutyryl cAMP inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner , whereas histamine failed to affect proliferation and differentiation of U937 cells .
Cells pretreated with dimaprit showed a decrease in the cAMP response to subsequent addition of H2 agonists , whereas the cAMP response to prostaglandin E2 remained unaltered .
This homologous mechanism of H2 receptor desensitization was time dependent .
These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation , such as cAMP and c-fos production , but fails to promote differentiation of U937 cells , apparently due to the rapid desensitization of H2 receptors .
Regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene expression is controlled by a B cell-specific promoter , intronic enhancer and additional B cell-specific enhancer elements identified recently in the 3' end of the IgH locus .
One of the latter elements , the IgH 3' enhancer , is of particular interest : ( 1 ) it is B cell-specific and active only in late B cell development ; ( 2 ) in rodent plasmacytomas and in some human Burkitt 's lymphomas it is part of a locus control region ( LCR ) that is involved in deregulation of the c-myc oncogene as a result of translocation into the IgH locus ; and ( 3 ) it has been implicated in the mechanisms that control Ig gene class switch recombination .
We have used a somatic cell hybridization approach to genetically analyse regulation of the activity of the IgH 3' enhancer .
When mouse MPC11 plasmacytoma cells , in which the IgH 3' enhancer is active , are fused with fibroblasts , Ig expression is extinguished at the level of transcription .
Here we show that in a MPC11 plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment , the IgH 3' enhancer is transcriptionally inactive .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that binding of several B cell-specific transcription factors , essential for IgH 3' enhancer activity , is lacking , which may explain 3' enhancer inactivity , although the binding of repressors can not be excluded .
Moreover , the high expression level of c-myc , characteristic of the parental MPC11 cells carrying the t(12;15) translocation , is down-regulated in the hybrids to that in unfused fibroblasts .
Therefore , inactivation of the IgH 3' enhancer is a multifactorial process affecting several transcription factors that control the cell-specific and developmental activity of the enhancer .
The common gamma-chain ( gamma(c) ) is a functional component of the IL-4R , yet cells lacking gamma(c) are able to respond to IL-4 .
This has led to the suggestion that a surrogate gamma'-chain , which can interact with the IL-4R alpha chain to mediate signaling , is expressed on cells lacking gamma(c) .
An alternative possibility is that in the absence of gamma(c) , the IL-4R alpha chain is able to transduce signals by homodimerization .
To test this latter possibility , a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of c-kit ( the stem cell factor ( SCF ) receptor ) and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IL-4R alpha chain was generated .
Treatment of cells expressing the chimeric receptor kit/IL-4R alpha with SCF induces activation of the IL-4R alpha-associated kinase JAK-1 and the transcription factor STAT6 .
However , tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-3 , which associates with gamma(c) , is not induced by SCF in these cells .
SCF-mediated ligation of kit/IL-4R alpha is sufficient to elicit IL-4-specific gene expression , including up-regulation of CD23 and synthesis of germ-line epsilon transcripts .
In the T cell line CTLL2 , ligation of kit/IL-4R alpha induces cellular proliferation .
Finally , in JAK-1-deficient HeLa cells , STAT6 activation by IL-4 is completely abolished .
Together , these data demonstrate that the IL-4R alpha cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to activate JAK-1 and STAT6 and to induce expression of IL-4 target genes , thus identifying a mechanism by which IL-4 signaling can proceed in the absence of JAK-3 and gamma(c) .
Cyclin A transcription is cell cycle regulated and induced by cell proliferative signals .
To understand the mechanisms underlined in this regulation in normal human cells , we have analysed in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the Cyclin A locus in primary T lymphocytes .
Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the absence of accessory cells .
Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was not effective .
In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major transcription initiation sites , the presence of at least three protein binding sites , two of which were constitutively occupied .
They bind in vitro respectively ATF-1 and NF-Y proteins .
The third site was occupied in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone .
The mitogenic combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation .
Consistent with theses results , nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element , whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 failed to do so after cells entered a proliferative state .
Thrombin activation requires assembly of a prothrombinase complex of activated coagulation factors on an anionic phospholipid surface , classically provided by activated platelets .
We have previously shown that anionic phosphatidylserine is exposed by rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) undergoing apoptosis after serum withdrawal .
In this study , using a chromogenic assay , we have shown thrombin generation by apoptotic VSMCs expressing c-myc ( VSMC-myc ) with an area under the thrombin-generation curve ( AUC ) of 305 +/- 17 nmol x min/L and a peak thrombin ( PT ) of 154 +/- 9 nmol/L .
The thrombin-generating potential of the apoptotic VSMC-myc cells was greater than that of unactivated platelets ( P = .003 for AUC ; P = .0002 for PT ) and similar to calcium-ionophore activated platelets ( AUC of 332 +/- 15 nmol x min/L , P = .3 ; PT of 172 +/- 8 nmol/L , P = .2 ) .
Thrombin activation was also seen with apoptotic human VSMCs ( AUC of 211 +/- 8 nmol x min/L ; PT of 103 +/- 4 nmol/L ) and was inhibited by annexin V ( P < .0001 for AUC and PT ) .
VSMC-myc cells maintained in serum generated less thrombin than after serum withdrawal ( P = .0002 for AUC and PT ) .
VSMCs derived from human coronary atherosclerotic plaques that apoptose even in serum also generated thrombin ( AUC of 260 +/- 2 nmol x min/L ; PT of 128 +/- 4 nmol/L ) .
We conclude that apoptotic VSMCs possess a significant thrombin-generating capacity secondary to phosphatidylserine exposure .
Apoptotic cells within atherosclerotic plaques may allow local thrombin activation , thereby contributing to disease progression .
We have investigated the effect of adenovirus 2 ( Ad2 ) infection on human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages with regard to expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta .
In monocytes , the virus was bound to the surface without being internalized .
On the other hand , Ad2 was internalized by macrophages .
No virus replication and no transcription of the Ad2 early genes was observed in either of the cells .
Ad2 infection induced transient increase in the mRNA levels for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in both monocytes and in macrophages , although the kinetics of the transcription was slightly different .
The production of both cytokines , measured by ELISA tests , was enhanced in monocytes .
In macrophages , a slight enhancement of TNF-alpha production was seen , whereas IL-1 beta was not detected .
The data indicate that cellular genes might be activated by Ad2 virus infection in nonpermissive cells where no viral gene products could be detected .
Characterization of the cellular transcription factors interacting with the human T cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is essential to dissecting the mechanisms involved in viral transcription that may be pertinent to the oncogenic and neuropathogenic processes associated with HTLV-I infection in both the immune and nervous systems .
Electrophoretic mobility shift ( EMS ) analyses utilizing oligonucleotides homologous to each of the 21 bp repeat elements reacted with nuclear extracts derived from cell lines of lymphocytic , monocytic , neuronal , and glial cell origin have demonstrated differential binding of cellular factors to the three 21 bp repeats ( 1-4 ) .
ATF/CREB and Sp family members interacted with the 21 bp repeats to form DNA-protein complexes common to all cell types examined .
However , a unique DNA-protein complex was detected when the promoter central 21 bp repeat was reacted with nuclear extracts derived from either the U-373 MG glioblastoma cell line or the THP-1 mature monocytic cell line .
Based on nucleotide sequence requirements and immunoreactivity , we demonstrate that this DNA-protein complex is comprised of the AP-1 components , Fos and Jun .
Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) is produced by T lymphocytes and known to support B cell growth and eosinophilic differentiation of the progenitor cells .
Using ATL-16T cells which express IL-5 mRNA , we have identified a region , within the human IL-5 gene promoter , that regulates IL-5 gene transcription .
This cis-acting sequence contains the core binding motif , (A/T)GATA(A/G) , for GATA-binding family proteins and thus suggests the involvement of these family members .
In this report , we describe the cloning of human GATA-4 ( hGATA-4 ) and show that hGATA-4 selectively interacts with the -70 GATA site within the IL-5 proximal promoter region .
By promoter deletion and mutation analyses , we established this region as a positive regulatory element .
Cotransfection experiments revealed that both hGATA-4 and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the IL-5 promoter activation .
The requirement of another regulatory element called CLE0 , which lies downstream of the -70 GATA site , was also demonstrated .
ATL-16T cells express mRNA of three GATA-binding proteins , hGATA-2 , hGATA-3 and hGATA-4 , and each of them has a potential to bind to the consensus (A/T)GATA(G/ A) motif .
However , using ATL-16T nuclear extract , we demonstrated that GATA-4 is the only GATA-binding protein that forms specific DNA-protein complex with the -70 GATA site .
The electrophoretic mobility shift assay with extracts of COS cells expressing GATA-binding proteins showed that GATA-4 has the highest binding affinity to the -70 GATA site among the three GATA-binding proteins .
When the transactivation ability was compared among the three , GATA-4 showed the highest activity .
These results demonstrate the selective role of GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5 gene in a circumstance where multiple members of the GATA-binding proteins are expressed .
BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is constitutively expressed in B cells and interacts with the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors .
Upon activation of Jurkat T cells and primary murine thymocytes with phorbol esters and ionomycin , BOB.1/OBF.1 expression and transactivation function were induced .
BOB.1/OBF.1 was phosphorylated at Ser184 both in vivo and in vitro , and this modification was required for inducible activation .
Mutation of Ser184 also diminished transactivation function in B cells , suggesting that the activating phosphorylation that is inducible in T cells is constitutively present in B cells .
Thus , BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is critically regulated by posttranslational modifications to mediate cell type-specific gene expression .
Biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) is predominantly by cells of the monocytic lineage .
This study examined the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the human TNF-alpha promoter in cells of monocytic lineage .
Functional analysis of monocytic THP-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing various lengths of TNF-alpha promoter localized enhancer elements in a region ( -182 to -37 base pairs ( bp ) ) that were required for optimal transcription of the TNF-alpha gene in response to LPS .
Two regions were identified : region I ( -182 to -162 bp ) contained an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site , and region II ( -119 to -88 ) contained CRE and NF-kappaB ( designated kappaB3 ) sites .
In unstimulated THP-1 , CRE-binding protein and , to a lesser extent , c-Jun complexes were found to bind to the CRE site .
LPS stimulation increased the binding of c-Jun-containing complexes .
In addition , LPS stimulation induced the binding of cognate nuclear factors to the Egr-1 and kappaB3 sites , which were identified as Egr-1 and p50/p65 , respectively .
The CRE and kappaB3 sites in region II together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter , whereas individually they failed to provide transcriptional activation .
Furthermore , increasing the spacing between the CRE and the kappaB3 sites completely abolished LPS induction , suggesting a cooperative interaction between c-Jun complexes and p50/p65 .
These studies indicate that maximal LPS induction of the TNF-alpha promoter is mediated by concerted participation of at least two separate cis-acting regulatory elements .
Glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) are ubiquitous molecules and are present also in the hippocampus and in several other nervous and immune tissues .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) are a good model for studies of GR in humans .
Glucocorticoids are important for maintaining cellular and humoral homeostasis and are key mediators of neuroendocrine-immune regulatory interactions .
The increase of cortisol is immunosuppressive and reduces GR concentration both in nervous and immune systems .
Variation of glucocorticoids in healthy aged subjects and athletes has been shown .
Prompted by these results , we have investigated in man a possible relationship between GR binding capacity in the PBMCs and age , in relation also to plasma testosterone and cortisol .
The same parameters have been examined in a group of soccer players for comparison with the sedentary group .
GR binding capacity was higher in younger subjects than in older ones , and lower in the group of athletes than in the younger and older sedentary subjects .
In the sedentary group a negative correlation was present between GR binding capacity and age .
Plasma cortisol was higher and testosterone lower in the athletes ; they were negatively correlated in athletes and positively correlated in the sedentary subjects .
The results for athletes agree with their lower anabolic/catabolic balance .
The mechanism of reduced GR levels in relation to age and sport activity could involve a loss or an involution of receptor synthesis .
However other possibilities , such as altered distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations with different receptor concentrations and with different cytokine production , can not be excluded .
Several neuroendocrine-immune interactions could be responsible for reduced GR levels with age and sport activity in man .
IFN signaling is mediated by binding of IFNs to their receptors and subsequent activation of Janus tyrosine kinase ( JAK ) -STAT signaling pathway .
Stimulation of cells with IFN-alpha leads to the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription factor complex formed by STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 protein .
IFN-gamma signaling is mediated by homodimeric STAT1 protein .
Although these signaling molecules are expressed constitutively , there is also evidence of transcriptional regulation by IFNs .
We have characterized the expression of STAT and IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family transcription factors in primary human blood mononuclear cells and macrophages in response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation .
We show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma rapidly and efficiently enhanced STAT1 , STAT2 , p48 , and IRF-1 gene expression .
IFN-gamma induced IRF-1 gene expression more strongly than IFN-alpha .
Stimulation experiments in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , suggested that these genes were activated directly by IFNs .
IRF-2 gene was apparently only weakly responsive to IFNs in these cells .
When macrophages were pretreated with low doses of IFN-gamma and then stimulated with IFN-alpha , clearly enhanced formation of specific transcription factor complexes was detected .
This suggests that higher intracellular levels of STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 protein may result in enhanced signal transduction for cytokines utilizing these transcription factors .
It is known that the expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) in adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) cells are high , whereas those in T-lymphoid cells are not .
In order to investigate the factors that influence the induction of ICAM-1 molecules , Northern blot analysis to measure the expression level of ICAM-1 mRNAs and Southern blot hybridization to analyze the integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) provirus were done .
The levels of ICAM-1 mRNA expression of ATL cells were generally higher than those of T-lymphoid cells .
However , ILT-mat cells and ATL16T(-) cells , although they were ATL cells , showed rather low surface ICAM-1 expression and ICAM-1 mRNA expression .
Southern blot hybridization showed that only two and four bands were found in ILT-mat and ATL16T(-) cells , respectively , whereas > 10 bands were detected in other ATL cells .
These results suggest that monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus to the genome of T cell , especially the number of integration sites , is one of the factors for induction of ICAM-1 molecules .
When transcriptionally active , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter contains a nucleosome-free region encompassing both the promoter/enhancer region and a large region ( 255 nucleotides [ nt ] ) downstream of the transcription start site .
We have previously identified new binding sites for transcription factors downstream of the transcription start site ( nt 465 to 720 ) : three AP-1 sites ( I , II , and III ) , an AP3-like motif ( AP3-L ) , a downstream binding factor ( DBF ) site , and juxtaposed Sp1 sites .
Here , we show that the DBF site is an interferon-responsive factor ( IRF ) binding site and that the AP3-L motif binds the T-cell-specific factor NF-AT .
Mutations that abolish the binding of each factor to its cognate site are introduced in an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone to study their effect on HIV-1 transcription and replication .
Individual mutation of the DBF or AP3-L site as well as the double mutation AP-1(III)/AP3-L did not affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus .
In contrast , proviruses carrying mutations in the Sp1 sites were totally defective in terms of replication .
Virus production occurred with slightly delayed kinetics for viruses containing combined mutations in the AP-1(III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites and in the AP3-L and DBF-sites , whereas viruses mutated in the AP-1(I,II,III) and AP3-L sites and in the AP-1(I,II,III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites exhibited a severely defective replicative phenotype .
No RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA .
Measurement of the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter after transient transfection of the HIV-1 provirus DNA or of long terminal repeat-luciferase constructs showed a positive correlation between the transcriptional and the replication defects for most mutants .
Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression .
Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a critical transcription factor for maximal expression of many cytokines that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases , such as adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and sepsis syndrome .
Activation and regulation of NF-kappa B are tightly controlled by a group of inhibitory proteins ( I kappa B ) that sequester NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm of immune/inflammatory effector cells .
NF-kappa B activation involves signaled phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteolysis of I kappa B .
Liberated NF-kappa B migrates to the nucleus , where it binds to specific promoter sites and activates gene transcription .
The activation of NF-kappa B initiates both extracellular and intracellular regulatory events that result in autoregulation of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-kappa B activation .
Recently , activation of NF-kappa B has been linked to ARDS and has been shown to be a critical proximal step in the initiation of neutrophilic inflammation in animal models .
Activation of NF-kappa B can be inhibited in vivo by treatment with antioxidants , corticosteroids , and the induction of endotoxin tolerance .
Identification of more specific and efficacious inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation might prove beneficial for the treatment of cytokine-mediated inflammatory diseases .
The first product of ascorbate oxidation , the ascorbate free radical ( AFR ) , acts in biological systems mainly as an oxidant , and through its role in the plasma membrane redox system exerts different effects on the cell .
We have investigated the role of ascorbate , AFR and dehydroascorbate ( DHA ) in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor in Jurkat T-cells stimulated by tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Here we show , by electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that ascorbate increases the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA in TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells .
The ability of ascorbate to enhance cytoplasmic inhibitory IkBalpha protein degradation correlates completely with its capacity to induce NF-kappaB binding to DNA and to potentiate NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells but not in cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin .
AFR behaves like ascorbate , while DHA and ascorbate phosphate do not affect TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation .
These results provide new evidence for a possible relationship between the activation of the electron-transport system at the plasma membrane by ascorbate or its free radical and redox-dependent gene transcription in T-cells .
The T-cell receptor ( TCR ) beta-chain promoters have been characterized as nonstructured basal promoters that carry a single conserved ubiquitous cyclic AMP-responsive element .
Our investigation of the human TCR beta gene uncovers a surprisingly complex and tissue-specific structure at the TCR Vbeta 8.1 promoter .
The core of the promoter ( positions -42 to +11 ) is recognized by the lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors Ets-1 , LEF1 , and AML1 as well as by CREB/ATF-1 , as is demonstrated in gel shift and footprinting experiments .
With the exception of LEF1 , these factors activate transcription in T cells .
Binding sites at the core region show little conservation with consensus sites .
Nonetheless , CREB , Ets-1 , and AML1 bind and activate cooperatively and very efficiently through the nonconsensus binding sites at the core promoter region .
Moderate ubiquitous activation is further induced by CREB/ATF and Sp1 factors through proximal upstream elements .
The tissue-specific core promoter structure is apparently conserved in other T-cell-specifically expressed genes such as the CD4 gene .
Our observations suggest that both the enhancer and the promoter have a complex tissue-specific structure whose functional interplay potentiates T-cell-specific transcription .
Triggering of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex activates two major signal cascades in T lymphocytes , ( i ) Ca2+-dependent signal cascades and ( ii ) protein kinase cascades .
Both signal cascades contribute to the induction of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene during T-cell activation .
Prominent protein kinase cascades are those that activate mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases .
We show here that c-Raf , which is at the helm of the classic MAP-Erk cascade , contributes to IL-2 induction through a distal enhancer element spanning the nucleotides from positions -502 to -413 in front of the transcriptional start site of the IL-2 gene .
Induction of this distal IL-2 enhancer differs from induction of the proximal IL-2 promoter-enhancer , since it is induced by phorbol esters alone and independent from Ca2+ signals .
In DNA-protein binding studies , we detected the binding of transcription factors GABP alpha and -beta to a dyad symmetry element ( DSE ) of the distal enhancer , which is formed by palindromic binding sites of Ets-like factors .
Introduction of point mutations suppressing GABP binding to the DSE interfered with the induction of the distal enhancer and the entire IL-2 promoter-enhancer , while overexpression of both GABP factors enhanced the IL-2 promoter-enhancer induction .
Overexpression of BXB , a constitutive active version of c-Raf , and of further members of the Ras-Raf-Erk signal cascade exerted an increase of GABP-mediated promoter-enhancer induction .
In conjunction with previously published data on c-Raf-induced phosphorylation of GABP factors ( E.Flory , A. Hoffmeyer , U.Smola , U.R.Rapp , and J.T.Bruder , J.Virol.70 : 2260- 2268 , 1996 ) , these results indicate a contribution of GABP factors to the Raf-mediated enhancement of IL-2 induction during T-cell activation .
Fusion proteins involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) and the PML or PLZF nuclear protein are the genetic markers of acute promyelocytic leukemias ( APLs ) .
APLs with the PML-RAR alpha or the PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced differentiation : PML-RAR alpha blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment , while patients with PLZF-RAR alpha do not .
We here report that ( i ) like PML-RAR alpha expression , PLZF-RAR alpha expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines ( U937 and HL-60 ) in response to different stimuli ( vitamin D3 , transforming growth factor beta1 , and dimethyl sulfoxide ) ; ( ii ) PML-RAR alpha , but not PLZF-RAR alpha , increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells ; ( iii ) PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar RA binding affinities ; and ( iv ) PML-RAR alpha enhances the RA response of RA target genes ( those for RAR beta , RAR gamma , and transglutaminase type II [ TGase ] ) in vivo , while PLZF-RAR alpha expression has either no effect ( RAR beta ) or an inhibitory activity ( RAR gamma and type II TGase ) .
These data demonstrate that PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar ( inhibitory ) effects on RA-independent differentiation and opposite ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) effects on RA-dependent differentiation and that they behave in vivo as RA-dependent enhancers or inhibitors of RA-responsive genes , respectively .
Their different activities on the RA signalling pathway might underlie the different responses of PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha APLs to RA treatment .
The PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein contains an approximately 120-amino-acid N-terminal motif ( called the POZ domain ) , which is also found in a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of poxvirus proteins and which mediates protein-protein interactions .
Deletion of the PLZF POZ domain partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RAR alpha on RA-induced differentiation and on RA-mediated type II TGase up-regulation , suggesting that POZ-mediated protein interactions might be responsible for the inhibitory transcriptional activities of PLZF-RAR alpha .
Induction of the adaptive immune response depends on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines by antigen-presenting cells .
The mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection are poorly understood .
It has been proposed that their expression is controlled by the non-clonal , or innate , component of immunity that preceded in evolution the development of an adaptive immune system in vertebrates .
We report here the cloning and characterization of a human homologue of the Drosophila toll protein ( Toll ) which has been shown to induce the innate immune response in adult Drosophila .
Like Drosophila Toll , human Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain , and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor .
Both Drosophila Toll and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the NF-kappaB pathway .
We show that a constitutively active mutant of human Toll transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of NF-kappaB-controlled genes for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 , IL-6 and IL-8 , as well as the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 , which is required for the activation of naive T cells .
During humoral immune responses , B-lymphocyte activation is followed by differentiation along either the plasma cell pathway or the memory B-cell pathway .
Recent studies suggest that CD40-CD40 ligand , OX-OX40 ligand , a group of cytokines and intracellular transcriptional factors may all contribute to B-lymphocyte differentiation control .
Using homologous recombination , both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were inactivated .
These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells .
However , the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies .
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated , with the exception of beta h1-globin , which continued to be expressed at a very low level .
The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells .
When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts , they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals , based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 ( GPI-1 ) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes .
In contrast , semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6 % to 8 % .
This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived , apparently due to the imbalance of beta- versus alpha-globin chains , leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies .
Consistent with this hypothesis , the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene , as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat , an early regulatory protein that is critical for viral gene expression and replication , transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) via its binding to the transactivation response element ( TAR ) and , along with other cellular factors , increases viral transcription initiation and elongation .
Tat also superactivates the HIV-1 promoter through a TAR-independent mechanism , including tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced and protein kinase C ( PKC ) -dependent activation of NF-kappa B , and inhibitors of Tat and NF-kappa B cooperatively down-regulate this Tat-mediated LTR superactivation .
In this study , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy using two PKC ( NF-kappa B ) inhibitors , pentoxifylline ( PTX ) and Go-6976 , and a stably expressed anti-Tat single-chain intracellular antibody ( sFv intrabody ) was employed to obtain cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .
Treatment of cells with PTX and Go-6976 resulted in cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .
In addition , the combined use of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-kappa B inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days .
The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-kappa B inhibitors alone or the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies alone .
Together , these results suggest that in future clinical gene therapy trials , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here may improve the survival of transduced cells and prolong clinical benefit .
The aim of this study was to analyze the role of cholecystokinin ( CCK(B) ) receptor in human lymphoblastic Jurkat T cells .
We investigated the trophic effect resulting from activation of such a receptor by using the reporter gene strategy .
For this purpose , we transiently transfected Jurkat T cells with the reporter plasmid p [(TRE)3-tk-Luc] and found that CCK-8 was able to dose-dependently induce luciferase expression related to activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activation with a maximal response identical to that obtained with compounds known to activate AP-1 complex ( quantitatively , the same level of induction was obtained with 1 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , 100 microM diacylglycerol , or 4 nM epidermal growth factor ) .
The involvement of the CCK(B) receptor in such a stimulation was demonstrated by the inhibiting effect of the selective CCK(B) receptor antagonist PD-135,158 .
This effect was confirmed in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA of CCK(B) receptor cloned from Jurkat T cells .
To better understand the AP-1-dependent luciferase expression in Jurkat T cells , we tested two specific inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases-1 and -2A : okadaic acid and calyculin A .
These compounds strongly increased the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate response , whereas we have not observed a contribution of phosphatase inhibitors on a CCK-8-induced luciferase activity .
To confirm that CCK(B) receptors are involved in AP-1 response , we investigated the CCK-8 effect on interleukin-2 expression , a natural endogenous gene regulated by several factors , including AP-1 .
In Jurkat T cells activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin , CCK-8 induced IL-2 expression .
This induction was abolished by PD-135,158 .
Our results indicate that CCK-8 exerts a trophic effect in Jurkat T cells through stimulation of CCK(B) receptors by modulation of expression of AP-1-regulated genes .
Phagocytosis represents an important physiological trigger for the inducible expression of several genes in human neutrophils .
Here , we report that a DNA-binding activity primarily consisting of the classical NF-kappa B heterodimer , p50/RelA , is induced in phagocytosing neutrophils .
Under these conditions , NF-kappa B activation was found to be a rapid and transient response , reaching a maximum by 10-15 min , and returning to near-basal levels by 30 min .
In neutrophils undergoing the phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts , the onset of NF-kappa B activation was paralleled by a decline in immunoreactive I kappa B-alpha protein levels , and the cellular I kappa B-alpha pool was replenished by 30 min , in agreement with our gel shift data .
We conclude that NF-kappa B activation could constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of kappa B-responsive genes is enhanced in phagocytosing neutrophils .
To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that phagocytic stimuli can induce NF-kappa B activation in human neutrophils .
Expression of the gene encoding human inosine- 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) type II , an enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the generation of guanine nucleotides , is increased more than 10-fold in activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and is required for T cell activation .
We have examined the 5'-regulatory sequences that are important for the transcriptional regulation of this gene in T cells .
DNase I mapping of genomic DNA identified a hypersensitive element near the transcription initiation site .
Fine mapping by in vivo footprinting demonstrated five transcription factor binding sites that are occupied in both resting and activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes ; these are tandem CRE motifs , a Sp1 site , an overlapping Egr-1/Sp1 site , and a novel palindromic octamer sequence ( POS ) .
The tandem CRE and POS sites are of major functional importance as judged by mutational and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses .
These data provide evidence that expression of the human IMPDH type II gene is predominantly regulated by the nuclear factors ATF-2 and an as yet unidentified POS-binding protein .
Additional major protein-DNA interactions do not occur within the promoter region after T lymphocyte activation , indicating a requirement for additional protein-protein interactions and/or post-translational modifications of pre-bound transcription factors to account for the observed increase in IMPDH type II gene expression .
The binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( Ox LDL ) by monocyte-macrophages causes pleiotropic effects , including changes in gene expression , and is thought to represent an early event in atherogenesis .
The integral membrane glycoprotein CD36 appears to play a physiological role in binding and uptake of Ox LDL by monocyte-macrophages , although the molecular events associated with CD36-Ox LDL interaction are unknown .
To approach this issue , we used CD36 transfected Chinese hampster ovary ( CHO ) cells , exposed them to Ox LDL , and determined changes in the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .
We report here that Ox LDL enhanced DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to an NF-kappaB sequence following activation of CD36-producing CHO cells with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
This enhanced DNA binding activity was inhibited by coincubation of CD36 transfected cells with the human CD36-specific antibody OKM5 .
We also determined that activation of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity required an intact carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic segment on CD36 .
Our results support the idea that human CD36 mediates signal transduction events in response to Ox LDL .
Mutations in the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3 are responsible for approximately 50 % of familial tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ) .
The gene has 41 small exons spanning 45 kb of genomic DNA and encoding a 5.5 kb mRNA .
Large germline deletions of TSC2 occur in < 5 % of cases , and a number of small intragenic mutations have been described .
We analysed mRNA from 18 unrelated cases of TSC for TSC2 mutations using the protein truncation test ( PTT ) .
Three cases were predicted to be TSC2 mutations on the basis of linkage analysis or because a hamartoma from the patient showed loss of heterozygosity for 16p13.3 markers .
Three overlapping PCR products , covering the complete coding sequence of mRNA , were generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines , translated into 35S-methionine labelled protein , and analysed by SDS-PAGE .
PCR products showing PTT shifts were directly sequenced , and mutations confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion where possible .
Six PTT shifts were identified .
Five of these were caused by mutations predicted to produce a truncated protein : ( i ) a sporadic case showed a 32 bp deletion in exon 11 , and a mutant mRNA without exon 11 was produced ; the normal exon 10 was also spliced out ; ( ii ) a sporadic case had a 1 bp deletion in exon 12 ( 1634delT ) ; ( iii ) a TSC2-linked mother and daughter pair had a G --> T transversion in exon 23 ( G2715T ) introducing a cryptic splice site causing a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 23 ; ( iv ) a sporadic case showed a 2 bp deletion in exon 36 ; ( v ) a sporadic case showed a 1 bp insertion disrupting the donor splice site of exon 37 ( 5007+2insA ) , resulting in the use of an upstream exonic cryptic splice site to cause a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from exon 37 .
In one case , the PTT shift was explained by in-frame splicing out of exon 10 , in the presence of a normal exon 10 genomic sequence .
Alternative splicing of exon 10 of the TSC2 gene may be a normal variant .
Three 3rd base substitution polymorphisms were also detected during direct sequencing of PCR products .
Confirmed mutations were identified in 28 % of the families studied and on the assumption that half of the sporadic cases should have TSC2 mutations , a crude estimate of the detection rate would be 60 % .
This compares favourably with other screening methods used for TSC2 , notably SSCP , and since PTT involves much less work it may be the method of choice .
The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate unwanted cells from a wide variety of organisms .
Various extracellular signals , often converging in common intracellular pathways , can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion .
Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors regulate apoptosis in many cell types .
In most cells , Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis ; however , under some circumstances , activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis .
We have identified a novel gene , GR6 , located within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21 , that is normally expressed in early fetal development but not in adult peripheral blood .
GR6 is activated in the UCSD-AML1 cell line and in a leukemic sample , both of which carry a t(3;3)(q21;q26) .
In UCSD-AML1 , we have also identified fusion transcripts between the ecotropic viral insertion site I ( EVI1 ) gene in 3q26 and GR6 and between EVI1 and Ribophorin I that maps 30 kb telomeric to GR6 in 3q21 .
All fusions splice the 5' ends of the 3q21 genes into exon 2 of the EVI1 gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of MDS1-EVI1 and to those previously documented in leukemias with t(3;21) and t(3;12) , in which acute myelogenous leukemia 1-EVI1 fusions and ETV6-EVI1 fusions , respectively , occur .
The Ribophorin I-EVI1 fusion in particular may be a common occurrence in t(3;3) .
The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas-mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease .
To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2 , as an anti-apoptosis protein .
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti-Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis .
In addition , BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells .
The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL .
Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32 , but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors .
A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas- induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .
Surprisingly , expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bcl-2 in a B-cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells .
Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .
Spi-1/PU.1 is a myeloid- and B-cell specific transcription factor which is also involved in Friend virus-induced murine erythroleukemia .
The pre-leukemic phase of Friend erythroleukemia results from activation of the erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) by the spleen focus forming virus ( SFFV ) envelope glycoprotein , followed by the emergence of leukemic clones characterized by overexpression of Spi-1 and mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene .
We developed a heterologous system to analyze the contribution of these alterations to the induction of primary erythroblast transformation .
Avian erythroblasts expressing the activated mouse EpoR ( R129C ) differentiated into erythrocytes in response to hEpo .
Expression of Spi-1 in these cells inhibited this ability to differentiate and rescued the cells from the apoptotic cell death program normally induced upon hEpo withdrawal .
Although devoid of any effect by itself , a mutant p53 cooperated with Spi-1 and EpoR ( R129C ) to reinforce both phenotypes .
Analysis of erythroblasts co-expressing Spi-1 and the wild-type mouse EpoR showed that differentiation arrest and inhibition of apoptosis depended on specific cooperation between Spi-1 and EpoR ( R129C ) .
This cooperation was also required to induce the sustained proliferation of differentiation-blocked erythroblasts in response to ligand activation of the endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit .
These results show that Spi-1/PU.1 requires signals emanating from specific cytokine and growth factor receptors to affect the survival , proliferation and differentiation control of primary erythroblasts .
They also suggest that the function of Spi-1/PU.1 in the late phase of Friend leukemia requires specific signaling from the gp55-modified EpoR generated during the early phase of the disease .
Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the A-MYB transcription factor plays central and specific role in the regulation of mature B cell proliferation and/or differentiation .
Furthermore , it is highly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease .
We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all the B cell lines studied , but not in T cells .
In particular the best responder cell line was the Burkitt 's cell line Namalwa .
The activity of A-MYB in B and not T cells was observed when either an artificial construct or the c-MYC promoter was used as a reporter .
Furthermore , the functional domains responsible for DNA binding , transactivation , and negative regulation , previously characterized in a fibroblast context , were found to have similar activity in B cells .
The region of A-MYB responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the N-terminal 218 amino acids containing the DNA binding domain .
Finally , a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of all the B , but not T , cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain .
We hypothesize that this 110-kDa protein may be a functionally important B cell-specific co-activator of A-MYB .
Ig heavy chain class switching is directed by cytokines inducing transcription from unrearranged CH genes .
Subsequently , such primed cells can undergo switch recombination to express the selected new isotype .
In the case of IgE class switching , IL-4 activates the IgE germline promoter by inducing the interaction of the transcription factor STAT6 ( IL-4STAT ) with a responsive DNA element in the proximal region of the promoter .
This study describes the characterization of two additional cis-acting elements that interact with members of the NF kappa B/rel transcription factor family in an IL-4-independent fashion .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that the nucleoprotein complex formed on the upstream site ( NF kappa B1 ) contains the classical p50/p65 heterodimer .
The complex on the proximal site ( NF kappa B2 ) appears to be composed of p50 and relB .
IgE germline promoter reporter gene constructs carrying point mutations in the NF kappa B2 site were largely unresponsive to IL-4 stimulation in transient transfection experiments , while plasmids with similar mutations in the NF kappa B1 site responded to cytokine stimulation better than the wild-type promoter .
The NF kappa B2 effect was dependent on the presence of the STAT6 binding site , demonstrating that the NF kappa B2 motif is necessary but not sufficient for mediating cytokine up-regulation .
In addition , the combination of a NF kappa B/rel binding site and the STAT6 response element conferred IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous minimal promoter , while the individual sites had no effect .
The available data suggest that the NF kappa B2 nucleoprotein complex may cooperate with DNA-bound STAT6 to achieve IL-4-dependent activation of the human IgE germline gene .
Since GH stimulates the development and function of granulocytes , we investigated the expression of GH in granulocyte subsets .
By immunocytochemistry , 25 +/- 7 % of the human neutrophils were shown to express immunoreactive GH , whereas eosinophils were negative .
Reversed transcription ( RT ) -PCR analysis demonstrated GH mRNA in neutrophils .
Restriction analysis revealed that neutrophils express the GH-N gene but not the GH-V gene .
Furthermore , we demonstrated by western blot analysis that neutrophils express an alternatively spliced variant of the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 , designated Pit-1b .
In the present report , we studied the role of the stromal-derived cytokine interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) in the IL-2-gene regulation in activated T lymphocytes .
Production of IL-2 requires the formation of transcription factors involved in the IL-2-gene regulation .
T-cell receptor ( TCR ) /CD3 engagement results in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , and nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) , whereas the CD28 responsive complex ( CD28RC ) is activated in response to the CD28 signal .
Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL-7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL-2-mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion .
The IL-2-gene transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold , indicating that the effect of IL-7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-7 effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFAT ( 60 % ) and AP-1 ( 120 % ) , without affecting the activities of NFkappaB and CD28RC , which was confirmed by transfection assays .
We also show that the IL-7-induced enhancement of the AP-1-DNA binding activity is not cyclosporin A-sensitive .
Since AP-1 is part of the NFAT complex , we conclude that the IL-7-signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the fos and jun proteins of which AP-1 consists .
Five healthy human leukocyte antigen-B8 ( HLA-B8 ) -positive virus carriers were studied to investigate the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) response to an HLA-B8-restricted peptide , RAKFKQLLQ , located in the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) immediate-early trans-activator protein , BZLF1 .
Of the 5 virus carriers , 4 were infected with type A and 1 with type B EBV .
Using limiting-dilution analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells , a high RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequency was demonstrated after specific peptide or autologous lymphoblastoid cell line stimulation in both type A and type B EBV carriers .
The RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequencies in all 5 persons were at least as dominant as those observed with two other EBV-associated , HLA-B8-restricted latent epitopes , FLRGRAYGL and QAKWRLQTL .
These findings show that healthy virus carriers maintain a high frequency of BZLF1-specific memory T cells , potentially to control virus spread from lytically infected cells .
The HIV-1 accessory gene product Vpr can influence viral pathogenesis by affecting viral replication as well as host cell transcription and proliferation .
We have investigated the effects of Vpr on host cell activation and confirm that it influences cellular proliferation .
However , we have also found that Vpr modulates T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -triggered apoptosis in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoids .
In the absence of TCR-mediated activation , Vpr induces apoptosis whereas in its presence , Vpr interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis .
This regulation of apoptosis is linked to Vpr suppression of NF-kappa B activity via the induction of I kappa B , an inhibitor of NF-kappa B .
Further , Vpr suppresses expression of IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF alpha and IL-4 , all of which are NF-kappa B-dependent .
The effects of Vpr could be reversed by RU486 .
Our finding that Vpr can regulate NF-kappa B supports the hypothesis that some aspects of viral pathogenesis are the consequence of cell dysregulation by Vpr .
Double-stimulation was used to demonstrate that , in a T lymphocytic cell line ( CEM ) , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) rapidly induced NF-kappa B through a signaling pathway which did not involve reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and was different from the activation triggered by either H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Since these latter compounds were known to activate NF-kappa B translocation in a redox-sensitive way , we have demonstrated that NF-kappa B activation by PMA was resistant to antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) and sensitive to kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H7 while activation by H2O2 or TNF-alpha were not .
The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) is an integral membrane protein which transforms fibroblasts and is essential for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization .
LMP-1 has been shown to trigger cellular NF-kappa B activity which , however , can not fully explain the oncogenic potential of LMP-1 .
Here we show that LMP-1 induces the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor , a dimer of Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos proteins .
LMP-1 effects on AP-1 are mediated through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) cascade , but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( Erk ) pathway .
Consequently , LMP-1 triggers the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain which is known to be activated upon JNK-mediated phosphorylation .
Deletion analysis indicates that the 55 C-terminal amino acids of the LMP-1 molecule , but not its TRAF interaction domain , are essential for AP-1 activation .
JNK-mediated transcriptional activation of AP-1 is the direct output of LMP-1-triggered signaling , as shown by an inducible LMP-1 mutant .
Using a tetracycline-regulated LMP-1 allele , we demonstrate that JNK is also an effector of non-cytotoxic LMP-1 signaling in B cells , the physiological target cells of EBV .
In summary , our data reveal a novel effector of LMP-1 , the SEK/JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway , which contributes to our understanding of the immortalizing and transforming potential of LMP-1 .
CD30 is a cell-surface receptor that can augment lymphocyte activation and survival through its ability to induce the transcription factor NF-kappaB .
CD30 , however , has also been implicated in the induction of apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes .
Here we show that one of the effects of CD30 signal transduction is to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR1 ) .
This sensitization is dependent on the TRAF-binding sites within the CD30 cytoplasmic domain .
One of the proteins that binds to these sites is TRAF2 , a signal transduction molecule that is also utilized by TNFR1 to mediate the activation of several downstream kinases and transcription factors .
During CD30 signal transduction , we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis .
These data suggest a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of TRAF2 .
Depletion of intracellular TRAF2 and its coassociated proteins also increased the sensitivity of the cell to undergoing apoptosis during activation of death-inducing receptors such as TNFR1 .
Consistent with this hypothesis , expression of a dominant-negative form of TRAF2 was found to potentiate TNFR1-mediated death .
These studies provide a potential mechanism through which CD30 , as well as other TRAF-binding members of the TNFR superfamily , can negatively regulate cell survival .
Curcumin ( diferuoylmethane ) , the yellow pigment in the rhizome of tumeric ( Curcuma longa ) , an ingredient of curry spice , is known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological effects including antitumor , antiinflammatory , and antiinfectious activities .
Although its precise mode of action remains elusive , curcumin has been shown to suppress the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor in cells stimulated to proliferate .
In this study , we observed that curcumin ( 50 microM ) inhibited proliferation of rat thymocytes stimulated with concanavalin A ( Con A ) as well as that of human Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells in the logarithmic growth phase .
The pigment also inhibited apoptosis in dexamethasone-treated rat thymocytes and in UV-irradiated Jurkat cells as judged by DNA ladder formation , cellular morphological changes , and flow cytometry analysis .
The inhibition of apoptosis by curcumin in rat thymocytes was accompanied by partial suppression of AP-1 activity .
Complete suppression of AP-1 activity was observed in Con A-treated , proliferating thymocytes .
The capacity of curcumin to inhibit both cell growth and death strongly implies that these two biological processes share a common pathway at some point and that curcumin affects a common step , presumably involving a modulation of the AP-1 transcription factor .
CD20 is a B-lineage-specific gene expressed at the pre-B-cell stage of B-cell development that disappears on differentiation to plasma cells .
As such , it serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of lineage and developmental stage-specific gene expression .
Using in vivo footprinting we identified two sites in the promoter at -45 and -160 that were occupied only in CD20+ B cells .
The -45 site is an E box that binds basic helix-loop-helix-zipper proteins whereas the -160 site is a composite PU.1 and Pip binding site .
Transfection studies with reporter constructs and various expression vectors verified the importance of these sites .
The composite PU.1 and Pip site likely accounts for both lineage and stage-specific expression of CD20 whereas the CD20 E box binding proteins enhance overall promoter activity and may link the promoter to a distant enhancer .
This paper presents a new hypothesis for the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease ( CD ) .
It is our contention that CD is triggered by the binding of one or more gliadin peptides to CD-associated HLA class II molecules .
Furthermore , we propose that these putative CD peptides bind to oligosaccharide residues on HLA class II molecules distal to the peptide-binding groove invoking recognition and binding by specialized subsets of gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes .
The binding of these gamma delta T cells serves as a signal for abrogation of oral tolerance to ingested proteins setting in motion a series of immune responses directed against the small intestinal epithelium of CD patients .
CD patients are victimized by this self-distructed immune response because of inheritance of certain combinations of HLA-DQ and DR haplotypes .
Dimers encoded by HLA-DR haplotypes may be the primary restriction elements for lectin-like , gliadin peptides while the degree of immune suppression ( or lack thereof ) to ingested gliadins is governed by inherited HLA-DQ haplotypes .
Finally , we speculate that molecular mimicry between one or more gliadin peptides and some , as yet unidentified , bacterial or viral superantigen plays a role in disease pathogenesis .
Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) is an important molecule in promotion of polymorphonuclear neutrophil transendothelial migration during inflammation .
Coincident with many inflammatory diseases is tissue hypoxia .
Thus we hypothesized that combinations of hypoxia and inflammatory stimuli may differentially regulate expression of endothelial ICAM-1 .
Human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of added lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and examined for expression of functional ICAM-1 .
Although hypoxia alone did not induce ICAM-1 , the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced ( 3 +/- 0.4-fold over normoxia ) ICAM-1 expression .
Combinations of hypoxia and LPS significantly increased lymphocyte binding , and such increases were inhibited by addition of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides .
Hypoxic endothelia showed a > 10-fold increase in sensitivity to inhibitors of proteasome activation , and combinations of hypoxia and LPS enhanced proteasome-dependent cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) subunit .
Such proteasome activation correlated with hypoxia-evoked decreases in both extracellular and intracellular pH .
We conclude from these studies that endothelial hypoxia provides a novel , proteasome-dependent stimulus for ICAM-1 induction .
In order to inquire into the functional state of adrenal cortex in patients with pulmonary heart disease , the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease was determined with radioligand-binding assay and the corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed with radioimmune assays .
The results showed that the number of GCR in the patients was significantly reduced ( P < 0.01 ) and it was increased when their health state was improved .
However , it was still lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0.01 ) .
The number of GCR in the patients was greatly increased when these patients were treated with oxygen ( P < 0.01 ) .
No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects ( P > 0.05 ) .
These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients , but the lower GCR number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients .
The number of GCR may be improved by inhalation of oxygen .
Therefore oxygen therapy is helpful in raising the activity of glucocorticoid receptors and controlling the development of the disease .
Differanisole A , 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-n-propylbenzoic acid , inhibited growth of human myeloid leukemia cells .
The compound induced G1 arrest and granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells , although the differentiation-inducing effect was modest .
Differanisole A and 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9cisRA ) synergistically inhibited the growth and induced functional and morphologic differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells , whereas the combined treatment with differanisole A and all-trans retinoic acid or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less effective .
Similar results were obtained in primary culture of leukemia cells from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia .
The synergistic effect on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation required simultaneous treatment with differanisole A and 9cisRA .
Differanisole A and an RXR-specific ligand ( Ro47-5944 ) cooperatively inhibited the cell growth , while the combined effect of differanisole A and an RAR-specific ligand Am80 was just additive .
Differanisole A in combination with 9cisRA may have implications for therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients .
Proteins of the ATF/CREB class of transcription factors stimulate gene expression of several cell growth-related genes through protein kinase A-related cAMP response elements .
The promoter activity of cell cycle regulated histone H4 genes is regulated by at least four principal cis-acting elements which mediate G1/S phase control and/or enhancement of transcription during the cell cycle .
Using protein-DNA interaction assays we show that the H4 promoter contains two ATF/CREB recognition motifs which interact with CREB , ATF1 , and ATF2 but not with ATF4/CREB2 .
One ATF/CRE motif is located in the distal promoter at the nuclear matrix-associated Site IV , and the second motif is present in the proximal promoter at Site I .
Both ATF/CRE motifs overlap binding sequences for the multifunctional YY1 transcription factor , which has previously been shown to be nuclear matrix associated .
Subnuclear fractionation reveals that there are two ATF1 isoforms which appear to differ with respect to DNA binding activity and partition selectively between nuclear matrix and nonmatrix compartments , consistent with the role of the nuclear matrix in regulating gene expression .
Site-directed mutational studies demonstrate that Site I and Site IV together support ATF1- and CREB-induced trans-activation of the H4 promoter .
Thus , our data establish that ATF/CREB factors functionally modulate histone H4 gene transcription at distal and proximal promoter elements .
To explore the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , we examined whether phosphorylation of one or more signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors was abnormal in cells from CLL patients .
No constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was detected on any STAT in CLL cells .
To assess the phosphorylation of serine residues of STAT1 and STAT3 in CLL cells , we raised antibodies that specifically recognize the form of STAT1 phosphorylated on ser-727 and the form of STAT3 phosphorylated on ser-727 .
We found that in 100 % of patients with CLL ( n = 32 ) , STAT1 and STAT3 were constitutively phosphorylated on serine .
This was in contrast to normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes or CD5+) B cells isolated from tonsils , in which this phosphorylation was absent .
Serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was seen occasionally in other leukemias , but it was a universal finding only in CLL .
The serine phosphorylation of these STATs was a continuous process , as incubation of CLL cells with the kinase inhibitor H7 led to the dephosphorylation of these serine residues .
The STAT serine kinase in CLL cells has not been identified , and appears to be neither mitogen-activated protein kinase nor pp70(s6k) .
In summary , the constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is present in all CLL samples tested to date , although the physiologic significance of this modification remains to be determined .
The objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and ( 2 ) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early ( minutes ) and late ( hours ) hyperadhesivity of postanoxic HUVECs to human neutrophils .
The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs , with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) after reoxygenation .
Oxypurinol and catalase inhibited phase-1 adhesion , suggesting a role for xanthine oxidase and H2O2 .
In comparison , platelet activating factor ( PAF ) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion .
Anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and anti-P-selectin antibodies ( monoclonal antibodies [ mAbs ] ) attenuated phase-1 neutrophil adhesion , consistent with roles for constitutively expressed ICAM-1 and enhanced surface expression of preformed P-selectin .
Phase-2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an anti-E-selectin mAb , indicating a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response .
Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides containing the nuclear factor-kappa B or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated phase-2 response , suggesting a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis .
Surface expression of ICAM-1 , P-selectin , and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase-1 and -2 neutrophil adhesion responses .
Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R elicits a two-phase neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules .
Fetal and neonatal lymphocytes are relatively resistant to activation and cytokine production when stimulated either via their T-cell antigen receptors or lectins .
The molecular mechanism ( s ) responsible for this phenomenon have not been clearly elucidated .
We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal/neonatal T-cell activation may be due to lack of expression of the transcriptional regulatory elements required for T-cell activation .
We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine both fetal and term neonatal cord bloods for mRNA expression of three transcription factors implicated in T-cell activation : c-jun , c-fos , and NF kappa B ( p50 subunit ) .
We demonstrate that mRNAs for all three of these regulatory factors are expressed in fetal blood cells by the 27th week of gestation and in term cord bloods .
Activation of term infant cord blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in up-regulation of both c-jun and c-fos mRNAs within 15 min of stimulation .
However , secretion of IL-2 by anti-CD3-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells was still blunted compared with control cells from adults .
We conclude that fetal nucleated blood cells constitutively express important genes for cytokine regulation and are able to increase intracellular accumulation of the mRNAs for these factors in response to anti-CD3 stimulation .
Thus , qualitative differences in the capacity to regulate these factors could not be shown in fetal blood cells .
Quantitative experiments comparing binding of these transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter are currently under investigation .
The binding site for nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is present at the promoter region of the germline Cepsilon gene , but there is little information on whether this factor is involved in regulating IgE synthesis by human B cells .
Accordingly , we studied the role of NF-kappaB in germline Cepsilon transcription by using two human Burkitt 's lymphoma B cell lines , DND39 and DG75 .
In both cell lines , n-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent thiol antioxidant , inhibited the triggering of the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB by IL-4 and by anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody .
Although IL-4 activated signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 6 in addition to NF-kappaB , NAC treatment or the transfection of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides for NF-kappaB or STAT6 only partly blocked IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription .
However , these two decoy oligodeoxynucleotides together almost completely abrogated IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription .
Of note , CD40-mediated enhancement of IL-4-driven germline Cepsilon transcription was markedly decreased by NAC or by a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide for NF-kappaB .
The effect of NAC was also examined on deletional switch recombination underlying the isotype switch to IgE .
NAC inhibited the generation of Smu/Sepsilon switch fragments in normal human B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody .
It also abolished IL-4-induced upregulation of CD40 but promoted upregulation of CD23 .
These results suggest that coordination of NF-kappaB and STAT6 may be required for induction of germline Cepsilon transcription by IL-4 , and that CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation may be important in regulating both enhancement of germline Cepsilon transcription and class switching to IgE .
Transcription factor NF-kappa B must be released from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules ( I kappa Bs ) in order to move to the nucleus and to activate its target genes .
Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B in some cell-types and of sustained nuclear NF-kappa B activity after stimulation .
Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive NF-kappa B activity in mature B cells .
We therefore compared the turnover of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in mature B cells and HeLa cells .
Both proteins display a high turnover in B cells although I kappa B beta is considerably more stable than I kappa B alpha .
The half-life of both inhibitors is increased in HeLa cells .
In contrast , all other NF-kappa B/I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell-types .
The elevated turnover of endogenous I kappa B alpha in Namalwa cells is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in non-B cells .
Furthermore , we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of NF-kappa B .
TNF-alpha signaling leads to a rapid depletion of cellular I kappa B beta pools .
I kappa B alpha is efficiently resynthesized whereas I kappa B beta levels stay low for a prolonged time .
NF-kappa B binding activity can be detected for several hours after stimulation .
We found that removal of the TNF-alpha containing medium causes a rapid decrease in nuclear NF-kappa B .
A phosphoform of newly synthesized I kappa B alpha is visible when degradation by the proteasome is inhibited and new I kappa B alpha displays the same properties regarding phosphorylation and degradation in response to a second inducer .
There is no significant difference in the turnover of pre- and post-inductive I kappa B alpha .
These observations suggest that resynthesis of I kappa B alpha and removal of the stimulus are obligatory steps for the inactivation of nuclear NF kappa B .
The transcription factor NF-kappa B is maintained in an inactive cytoplasmic state by I kappa B inhibitors .
In mammalian cells , I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta proteins have been purified and shown to be the inhibitors of NF-kappa B through their association with the p65 or c-Rel subunits .
In addition , we have isolated a third NF-kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B epsilon ( 1 ) .
Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta are proteolytically degraded , resulting in NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus .
Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published .
Our data also suggest that , unlike I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta is constitutively phosphorylated and resynthesized as a hypophosphorylated form .
The absence of slow migrating forms of I kappa B beta following stimulation suggests that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal-induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis .
A kappa B-site was identified in the promoter of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) gene , which is involved in regulation of ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and glucocorticoids .
We now report on the transcription factors which bind and transactivate this enhancer sequence .
In vitro , the ICAM-1 kappa B site appeared to bind RelA and c-Rel homodimers as well as heterodimers with NF-kappa B1 , but weakly NF-kappa B1 homodimers .
In addition , both RelA and c-Rel , but not NF-kappa B1 , were shown to transactivate an ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct .
In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site .
Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility supershift assay , one of these complexes was shown to contain NF-kappa B1 and RelA , and to bind with higher affinity to the consensus kappa B site in the HIV long terminal repeat .
The second complex contained RelA , and exhibited higher affinity towards the ICAM-1 kappa B than to the HIV kappa B site .
The glucocorticoid receptor was shown to repress activity of both the RelA homodimer and the NF-kappa B1/RelA heterodimer .
We argue that in vivo RelA homodimers are likely to play a dominant role in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytic cells .
The Oct2 transcription factor is expressed predominantly in B lymphocytes and plays an essential role during the terminal phase of B cell differentiation .
The regulatory regions of several genes specifically expressed in B cells contain functional binding sites for Oct2 .
Nevertheless , none of the genes originally thought to be regulated by Oct2 were affected in their expression in Oct2-deficient B cells .
In an attempt to find such elusive Oct2 target genes and to understand the molecular function of Oct2 in B cell development , we isolated cDNAs for Oct2 target genes .
So far , we have identified five potential targets for Oct2 : the membrane glycoprotein CD36 , the cysteine-rich secreted protein 3 ( CRISP-3 ) , a mouse homolog of the human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor ( mEI ) and two unknown cDNA sequences Nov1 and Nov2 .
These target genes show quite distinct expression patterns demonstrating that transcription factors in addition to Oct2 are involved in their regulation .
Whereas CD36 and mEI were expressed in all hematopoetic cell lines containing Oct2 , . CRISP-3 is pre-B cell-specific , Nov1 is plasma B cell-specific and Nov2 is B cell-specifically expressed .
Interleukin-12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells , and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells via CD40-CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) .
So far , transcriptional analyses of p40 have been carried out only using bacterial constituents such as LPS as stimuli .
In the present study , we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line , Daudi , and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 .
These cells , stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector , secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression .
Sequence analysis of the p40 promoter region identified two potential nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB binding sites conserved between mouse and human .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation .
Moreover , transfection of Daudi cells with the polymerized NF-kappaB binding sequence ligated to a thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid greatly induced CAT activity , but transfection with the polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence did not .
These results suggest that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB .
We previously reported that dexamethasone ( DEX ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid , causes apoptosis in mature Th cell lines , and that this induction of cell death is prevented by specific cytokines , namely , by IL-2 in Th1 cells and by IL-4 in Th2 cells .
We now show that this differential rescue by specific cytokines in Th cells correlates with the level of IkappaBalpha that is regulated by DEX and cytokines .
In both cell types the cellular levels of IkappaBalpha mRNA and protein were evaluated by DEX treatment .
Interestingly , the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2 , but not IL-4 , in Th1 cells , while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells .
In both cell types , the cytokine that inhibits the induction of IkappaBalpha by DEX , also rescues these cells from DEX-induced apoptosis , although the rescue cytokine is different in Th1 and Th2 cells .
Our results imply that T cells need to maintain a certain level of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in order to survive ; up- or down-regulation of nuclear NF kappaB through modulation of IkappaBalpha expression by cytokines or DEX may lead to cell survival or cell death , respectively .
The B cell-specific cell surface molecule CD19 is expressed at all stages of B cell development , including normal plasma cells , and mediates signal transduction via interaction with cytoplasmic effector proteins .
Cross-linking CD19 on early human B lineage cells induces the formation of a CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex , tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav , and activation of the Ras pathway .
To further explore the ramifications of CD19 signaling , the current study examined whether phosphorylation of Elk-1 , activation of activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , or activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) transcription factors occurred following CD19 cross-linking .
The cells used were the BLIN-1 pre-B cell line expressing low levels of cell surface mu heavy chain associated with surrogate light chain and the 1E8 immature B cell line expressing cell surface mu/kappa .
Lysates from CD19 cross-linked 1E8 cells induced robust phosphorylation of an Elk-1 fusion protein in vitro , whereas no phosphorylation of Elk-1 fusion protein occurred using lysates from CD19 cross-linked BLIN-1 cells .
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay employing AP-1 and NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotides was used to demonstrate that AP-1 -binding activity increased , while constitutive NF-kappaB-binding activity was not enhanced , following 2 h of CD19 cross-linking in 1E8 cells .
Supershift experiments revealed that JunD and c-Fos proteins mediated anti-CD19 induced AP-1-binding activity in 1E8 cells .
In contrast , CD19 cross-linking in BLIN-1 cells resulted in the induction of NF-kappaB , but had no apparent effect on AP-1-binding activity .
These data suggest that CD19-mediated signal transduction activates different transcription factors at juxtaposed stages of B cell development that may culminate in the activation or suppression of distinct sets of genes .
The Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes .
These include Fc epsilonRII ( CD23 ) , 15-lipoxygenase , IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) , and type I and type II IL-1 receptors ( IL-1R ) .
IFN-gamma has been shown to inhibit induction of CD23 and 15-lipoxygenase in monocytes ; however , the effects of IFN-gamma on type I and type II IL-1R gene expression have not been defined .
We examined the effects of IFN-gamma on both basal and IL-4/IL-13-induced IL-1R gene expression in primary monocytes .
IL-4 and IL-13 induced dose- and time-dependent increases in IL-1RI and IL-1RII mRNA levels .
IFN-gamma decreased basal expression as well as the induction of these genes by IL-4 and IL-13 .
Inhibition of IL-1RI and IL-1RII mRNA levels by IFN-gamma was transcriptionally mediated , and correlated directly with decreased production of soluble IL-1RII .
Furthermore , the ability to suppress IL-1RI and IL-1RII mRNA levels was not unique to IFN-gamma because IL-10 also inhibited expression of these genes in IL-4/IL-13-stimulated monocytes .
Inhibition of IL-1R gene expression by IFN-gamma and IL-10 was not due to down-regulation of surface IL-4R because pretreatment with these cytokines did not decrease the number of IL-4 binding sites per cell .
However , suppression of IL-1R gene expression by IFN-gamma and IL-10 was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the IL-4/IL-13-inducible transcription factor , Stat6 , suggesting a potential mechanism by which IFN-gamma and IL-10 may mediate their suppressive effects .
These findings demonstrate that certain cytokines , including IFN-gamma and IL-10 , antagonize the ability of IL-4 and IL-13 to induce increased expression of the IL-1RI and IL-1RII genes in monocytes .
Department of lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells is controlled , in part , by the activity of transcriptional regulatory proteins .
In particular , one class of helix-loop-helix proteins , termed E-proteins , have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during B-cell development .
Recent analysis of gene-targeted mice has allowed a direct assessment of the functional roles of several E-protein family members in hematopoiesis .
In this review we describe the defects in B- and T- lymphocyte development in mice carrying targeted mutations in the E-protein genes and discuss our current understanding of the role of these proteins in lymphoid development .
By using high throughput screening of microbial broths , we have identified a compound , designated Ro 09-2210 , which is able to block anti-CD3 induced peripheral blood T cell activation with an IC50 = 40 nM .
Ro 09-2210 was also able to block antigen-induced IL-2 secretion with an IC50 = 30 nM , but was considerably less potent at blocking Ca2+ flux stimulated by anti-CD3 treatment .
To determine the mechanism of action of Ro 09-2210 , we set up a transient expression system in Jurkat T cells using a variety of reporter gene constructs and showed effective inhibition of phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced NF-AT activation and anti-CD3 induced NF-AT with IC50 = 7.7 and 10 nM , respectively .
Ro 09-2210 was also able to inhibit phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced activation of AP1 with IC50 = < 10 nM .
We further showed that Ro 09-2210 was unable to inhibit c-jun induced expression of AP1-dependent reporter constructs ( IC50 > 500 nM ) , but was able to potently inhibit ras-induced AP1 activation ( IC50 = 20 nM ) .
This suggested that Ro 09-2210 was inhibiting an activator of AP-1 which was upstream of c-jun and downstream of ras signaling .
To investigate further , we then purified a number of different kinases , including PKC , PhK , ZAP-70 , ERK , and MEK 1 ( a MKK ) , and showed that Ro 09-2210 was a selective inhibitor of MEK1 in vitro ( IC50 = 59 nM ) .
We examined signaling by erythropoietin in highly purified human colony forming unit-erythroid cells , generated in vitro from CD34(+) cells .
We found that erythropoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 , STAT5A , and STAT5B .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 reaches a peak around 10 minutes after stimulation and is maximum at 5 U/mL of erythropoietin .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 is accompanied by the translocation of activated STAT5 to the nucleus as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using 32Pi-labeled STAT5 binding site in the beta-casein promoter .
Tyrosine phosphorylation STAT1 or STAT3 was not detected in human erythroid precursors after stimulation with erythropoietin .
Crkl , an SH2/SH3 adapter protein , becomes coimmunoprecipitated specifically with STAT5 from erythropoietin-stimulated erythroid cells ; although it was shown to become associated with c-Cbl in the studies using cell lines .
Thus , human erythroid precursors can be expanded in vitro in sufficient numbers and purity to allow its usage in signal transduction studies .
This report sets a basis for further studies on signaling in primary cultured human erythroid precursors , which in turn contribute to our better understanding in the differentiation processes of erythrocytes and their precursors .
We recently determined that erythropoietin ( EPO ) activates 3 members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family , Stat1alpha , Stat3 , and Stat5 , in the human EPO-dependent cell lines , UT-7 and UT-7/EPO ( Kirito et al , J Biol Chem 272 : 16507 , 1997 ) .
In addition , we have shown that Stat1alpha , but not Stat3 , is involved in EPO-induced cellular proliferation .
In this study , we examined the roles of Stat1alpha and Stat3 in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation .
UT-7/GM was used as a model system , because this cell line can differentiate into erythroid-lineage cells with EPO treatment ( Komatsu et al , Blood 89 : 4021 , 1997 ) .
We found that EPO did not activate Stat1alpha or Stat3 in UT-7/GM cells .
Transfection experiments showed that both Stat1alpha and Stat3 inhibited the induction by EPO of gamma-globin and erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthetase transcripts , resulting in a reduction of the percentage of hemoglobin-positive cells .
Dominant negative forms of Stat1alpha or Stat3 promoted the EPO-induced erythroid differentiation of UT-7/GM cells , even in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , although this cytokine never induced erythroid differentiation of the parent UT-7/GM cells with or without EPO .
A cell cycle analysis showed that the constitutive activation of Stat1alpha , but not Stat3 , shortened the period of G0/G1 prolongation caused by EPO stimulation .
Taken together , our data suggest that Stat1alpha and Stat3 act as negative regulators in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation .
Specifically , Stat1alpha may activate a cell cycle-associated gene ( s ) , leading to the entry of cells into the cell cycle .
Activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) is essential for T cell receptor ( TCR ) responsiveness ; however , the function of individual PTK substrates is often uncertain .
A mutant T cell line was isolated that lacked expression of SLP-76 ( SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons ) , a hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein and PTK substrate .
SLP-76 was not required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins , but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 ( PLC-gamma1 ) , as well as Ras pathway activation .
TCR-inducible gene expression was dependent on SLP-76 .
Thus , coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76 .
BACKGROUND : The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) is a bi- or multifunctional domain protein that acts as a transcriptional activator and plays a critical role in the expression of MHC class II genes .
We have previously demonstrated that a mutated form of the human CIITA gene , coding for a protein lacking the amino terminal 151 amino acids , acts as a potent dominant-negative suppressor of HLA class II expression .
Porcine MHC class II antigens are potent stimulators of direct T-cell recognition by human CD4+ T cells and are , therefore , likely to play an important role in the rejection responses to transgenic pig donors in clinical xenotransplantation .
We were , therefore , interested in examining mutated CIITA constructs for their effect on porcine MHC class II expression .
METHODS : Stable transfectants of the porcine vascular endothelial cell line PIEC with mutated CIITA constructs were tested for SLA-DR and SLA-DQ induction by recombinant porcine interferon-gamma .
Transient transfectants of the porcine B-cell line L23 with the mutated CIITA constructs were tested for the suppression of constitutive SLA-DR and SLA-DQ expression .
T-cell proliferation studies were performed using highly purified human CD4+ T cells .
RESULTS : In preliminary studies , we demonstrated that transfection of the PIEC line with full-length human CIITA constructs resulted in strong expression of SLA-DR and SLA-DQ antigens , thus establishing the cross-species effectiveness of human CIITA in the pig .
The mutated human CIITA constructs were , therefore , tested in the pig .
PIEC clones stably transfected with one of these constructs showed up to 99 % suppression of SLA-DR and SLA-DQ antigen induction and marked suppression of SLA-DRA mRNA induction .
Moreover , transient transfection of the porcine B-cell line L23 showed up to 90 % suppression of constitutive SLA-DR and SLA-DQ antigen expression in 5-8 days .
In functional studies , interferon-gamma-stimulated PIEC clones transfected with this mutated CIITA construct failed to stimulate purified human CD4+ T lymphocytes .
CONCLUSION : Mutated human CIITA constructs are potent suppressors of porcine MHC class II expression .
We have recently described an inherited over-expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor ( SR ) in blood monocytes from members of a kindred , only two of whom displayed extensive xanthomatosis .
Using mRNA differential display we demonstrated abnormally high expression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT1alpha ) in monocytes from the proband II-2 .
Expression of gamma-interferon inducible protein 10 ( IP-10 ) , a STAT1alpha-responsive gene and mediator of inflammatory response , was also abnormally expressed in the monocytes from II-2 .
Over-expression of both genes was restricted to monocytes from II-2 and was not observed in monocytes from the clinically unaffected family members , unlike that of SR .
Gel retardation assays with THP-1 cell extracts identified gamma-IFN inducible DNA binding activity to three potential STATI DNA binding elements in the human IP-10 promoter region from nucleotides - 245 to - 188 .
Taken together these results suggest that gamma-interferon mediated cell activation is responsible for STAT1alpha-induced transcription of the IP-10 gene in THP-1 macrophages as well as in monocytes from II-2 .
Analysis of monocytes from familial hypercholesterolemic ( FH ) subjects , who frequently develop xanthomatosis , revealed a significant number of subjects with elevated STAT1alpha and IP-10 expression .
Our data suggest that the inflammatory effects of gamma-IFN signaling could play a role in foam cell formation and xanthomatosis .
The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection .
The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses .
The antigens recognized by many HSV-specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown .
T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of HSV DNA are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions .
Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument protein VP22 and the viral dUTPase , encoded by genes UL49 and UL50 , respectively , are T-cell antigens .
Separate epitopes in VP22 were defined for T-cell clones from each of three patients .
Reactivity with the tegument protein encoded by UL21 was identified for an additional patient .
Three new epitopes were identified in VP16 , a tegument protein associated with VP22 .
Some tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV-infected cells .
These results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines .
Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors .
We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals .
In this study , we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene .
In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines , IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid .
The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced : upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases , transactivation by octamer , NF-kappa B , and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated , while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced .
Inducible nitric oxide ( iNO ) is produced at sites of vascular inflammation by resident and nonresident vascular wall cells , but its role in the inflammatory process is not known .
In this study , we show that a novel function of iNO is to terminate inflammatory processes .
We find that iNO produced by murine macrophage-like cells , RAW264.7 , can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation in a separated and mixed endothelial-RAW264.7 coculture system .
Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-gamma .
Inhibition of iNO synthase ( iNOS ) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures , stimulated with murine-specific IFN-gamma and LPS , decreased iNO production by 86 % , augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RAW264.7 cells , respectively , and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface .
Transient transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter constructs demonstrated that inhibitory effects of iNO on VCAM-1 gene transcription were mediated , in part , by inhibitory effects of iNO on kappa B cis-acting elements .
Immunofluorescence studies using an Ab to the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B revealed that iNO inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B .
These studies indicate that iNO attenuates iNOS expression in macrophages and inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells , and suggest that endogenously derived iNO may be an important autoregulatory inhibitor of vascular inflammation .
The class II transactivator CIITA is required for transcriptional activation of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .
Aside from an N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain , little is known about how this factor functions .
Extensive mutagenesis of CIITA was undertaken to identify structural motifs required for function .
The ability of mutants to activate a reporter gene under the control of MHC class II conserved W-X-Y or X-Y regulatory elements was determined .
Two mutants displayed differential activity between the two promoters , activating transcription with the W-X-Y but not the X-Y elements .
All mutants were tested for their ability to interfere with wild-type CIITA activity .
Five CIITA mutant constructions were able to down-regulate wild-type CIITA activity .
Three of these mutants contained targeted disruptions of potential functional motifs : the acidic activation domain , a putative GTP-binding motif and two leucine charged domains ( LCD motifs ) .
The other two contained mutations in regions that do not have homology to described proteins .
The characterization of CIITA mutants that are able to discriminate between promoters with or without the W box strongly suggests that CIITA requires such interactions for function .
The identification of LCD motifs required for CIITA function brings to light a previously undefined role of these motifs in CIITA function .
Fas ( CD95/APO-1 ) is a transmembrane protein of the TNF/neuron growth factor receptor family .
Ligation of Fas by specific Abs or Fas ligand ( FasL/CD95 ligand ) induces rapid apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types .
Despite progress in understanding the death signals transduced from Fas , very little is known with regard to the mechanisms by which Fas expression is regulated .
Using our previously established murine T cell hybridoma model A1.1 , we show that specific protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitors could block activation-induced Fas expression and apoptosis .
The activation of PKC with PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol could mimic the TCR signal by inducing the expression of Fas but not FasL .
PKC-dependent Fas expression was also observed in several murine and human tumor cell lines .
Since the inhibition of Ca2+ redistribution by an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization , 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride , inhibited TCR-induced FasL but not Fas , the expression of Fas appears to be independent of Ca2+ mobilization .
Significantly , expression of the newly identified Fas-regulatory gene , TDAG51 , was found to be dependent upon the activity of PKC .
PKC activation only induced Fas expression in cells expressing wild-type TDAG51 .
Thus , Fas expression is likely mediated by PKC through TDAG51 .
The p56 Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation .
Hence in the absence of p56 , T cell receptor triggered activation does not occur .
We now provide evidence for a CD2-based signaling pathway which , in contrast to that of the T cell receptor , is independent of p56 .
CD2-mediated interleukin-2 production occurs via activation of Jun kinase in cell lines lacking p56 .
Jun kinase then facilitates the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the interleukin-2 promoter .
These data elucidate differences between TCR and CD2 signaling pathways in the same T cells .
Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) without affecting levels of Cu , Zn SOD , catalase , or glutathione peroxidase .
However , little is known about the structure-activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces Mn SOD .
In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin lacking myristoyl fatty acid at the 3' R-3-hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor-kappaB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity .
However , in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin , it failed to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha by monocytes and did not induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase .
These results suggest that 1 ) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid , although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes , is not necessary for the induction of Mn SOD , 2 ) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated , at least in part , through different signal transduction pathways , and 3 ) failure of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production is , at least in part , due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase .
In this study we report on the establishment and characterization of two novel lymphoma cell lines ( CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 ) which carry infection by human herpesvirus type-8 ( HHV-8 ) and have derived from AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) .
These two cell lines are representative of different virologic subtypes of PEL , i.e. HHV-8+/EBV- PEL in the case of CRO-AP/3 and HHV-8+/EBV+ PEL in the case of CRO-AP/5 .
Consistent with the diagnosis of PEL , both CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 expressed indeterminate ( i.e. non-B , non-T ) phenotypes although immunogenotypic studies documented their B-cell origin .
Both cell lines are devoid of genetic lesions of c-MYC , BCL-2 and p53 as well as gross rearrangements of BCL-6 .
Detailed histogenetic characterization of these novel PEL cell lines suggests that PEL may derive from a post-germinal centre B cell which has undergone pre-terminal differentiation .
The CRO-AP/3 and CRO-AP/5 cell lines may provide a valuable model for clarifying the pathogenesis of PEL .
In particular , these cell lines may help understand the relative contribution of HHV-8 and EBV to PEL growth and development and may facilitate the identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities highlighting putative novel cancer related loci relevant to PEL .
When human monocytes or alveolar macrophages are cultured in the presence of interleukin ( IL ) -4 or IL-13 , the expression of the reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase is induced .
In mice a 15-lipoxygenase is not expressed , but a leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase is present in peritoneal macrophages .
To investigate whether both lipoxygenase isoforms exhibit a similar regulatory response toward cytokine stimulation , we studied the regulation of the leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase of murine peritoneal macrophages by interleukins and found that the activity of this enzyme is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were cultured in the presence of the IL-4 or IL-13 but not by IL-10 .
When peripheral murine monocytes that do not express the lipoxygenase were treated with IL-4 expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase mRNA was induced , suggesting pretranslational control mechanisms .
In contrast , no upregulation of the lipoxygenase activity was observed when the macrophages were prepared from homozygous STAT6-deficient mice .
Peritoneal macrophages of transgenic mice that systemically overexpress IL-4 exhibited a threefold to fourfold higher 12-lipoxygenase activity than cells prepared from control animals .
A similar upregulation of 12-lipoxygenase activity was detected in heart , spleen , and lung of the transgenic animals .
Moreover , a strong induction of the enzyme was observed in red cells during experimental anemia in mice .
The data presented here indicate that ( 1 ) the 12-lipoxygenase activity of murine macrophages is upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IL-4 and/or IL-13 , ( 2 ) this upregulation requires expression of the transcription factor STAT6 , and ( 3 ) the constitutive expression of the enzyme appears to be STAT6 independent .
The cytokine-dependent upregulation of the murine macrophage 12-lipoxygenase and its induction during experimental anemia suggests its close relatedness with the human reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase despite their differences in the positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation .
The latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is required for EBV-induced immortalization of human B cells and causes tumorigenic transformation of cell lines .
LMP1 expression induces phenotypic changes resembling B cell activation , such as cell size increase and up-regulation of cell surface activation markers .
LMP1 contains two domains that activate the transcription factor NF-kappaB , one through interactions with TRAF proteins and the other with the TRADD protein .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the importance of NF-kappaB induction in the up-regulation of the B cell activation markers ICAM-1 and CD71 by LMP1 .
This study shows that expression of LMP1 activates transcription from p50/p65- and c-Rel- responsive promoters , and that this activity can be completely inhibited by expression of a dominant inhibitory IkappaB mutant .
ICAM-1 and CD71 are nevertheless up-regulated by LMP1 in primary B cells and cell lines expressing the dominant IkappaB .
Furthermore , LMP1-induced cell size increase of primary B cells was unaffected by IkappaB expression .
It was concluded that even when LMP1 is unable to activate NF-kappaB , it is still capable of inducing certain characteristics of activated B cells , strongly suggesting that LMP1 can also activate cells independently of NF-kappaB .
Human neutrophils can be induced to actively transcribe a number of early-response genes , in particular those encoding cytokines , chemokines , and the high-affinity surface receptor for IgG , FcgammaRI .
Although little is known to date about the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , several indications point to a role for distinct transcription factors , such as members of the NF-kappaB and STAT families .
In this study , we investigated whether these transcription factors become activated under stimulatory conditions which are known to induce gene transcription in neutrophils .
Unexpectedly , we found that conventional procedures employed to prepare cellular extracts cause the release of proteolytic activities that are normally stored in intracellular granules , resulting in the degradation of various NF-kappaB/Rel and STAT proteins .
To circumvent this problem , we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils , LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of p50/RelA dimers , and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter .
Moreover , we report that neutrophil stimulation with GM-CSF results in the formation of a STAT5-containing DNA-binding activity .
Collectively , the current findings open new perspectives about mechanisms that are likely to regulate gene transcription in neutrophils .
In addition , the procedure described herein could prove useful in other cell types that express high levels of endogenous proteases .
Given the reported long-range cis-inactivating effect of the XIST gene in early embryonic development and the lack of requirement of X-chromosome-specific elements for propagating the inactive state , there exists the possibility of cis inactivation of autosomal material after de novo translocation to an inactive X chromosome ( Xi ) in differentiated cells .
We have analyzed de novo radiation-induced translocations between the Xi and autosomes to study the maintenance and spreading of X-chromosome inactivation ( X inactivation ) in relation to the position of the X-inactivation center ( XIC ) /XIST in differentiated cells .
Autosome/Xi translocations were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
The activation status of the chromosomes involved in the translocation was determined by simultaneous immunocytogenetic studies using antibodies against either BrdU incorporated at late S phase or acetylated histone H4 .
The position of XIC/XIST in the reciprocal products of the translocation was determined by XIST-specific FISH and computer enhancement .
In other experiments , the Xq13 region carrying XIC/XIST was localized by computer enhancement of the DAPI banding pattern .
Our study in differentiated cells provides a visual demonstration that physical separation from XIC/XIST does not result in reactivation of inactive X-chromosome material and that X inactivation is not spread to the translocated autosomes irrespective of the position of XIC/XIST .
This observation suggests that physical linkage to XIC/XIST does not lead to de novo inactivation of autosomal material .
It has been proposed that the cross-priming of CTL responses in vivo involves the transfer to host APCs of heat shock protein glycoprotein 96-chaperoned antigenic peptides released from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) of dying or infected cells .
We have tested this possibility directly using TAP-deficient cell lines lacking antigenic ER peptides derived from two model Ags , the human adenovirus type 5 early regions E1A and E1B .
Although both proteins were well expressed , the cells were not recognized by E1A- or E1B-specific CTLs unless the relevant epitope was either provided exogenously as a synthetic peptide or targeted to the ER in a TAP-independent fashion .
Despite the absence of these ER peptides , the TAP1-/- cells were able to efficiently cross-prime E1A- and E1B-specific CTLs following immunization of syngeneic mice .
These results indicate that , although purified peptide/glycoprotein 96 complexes are potent immunogens , the mechanism of CTL cross-priming in vivo does not depend upon antigenic peptides in the ER of immunizing cells .
The cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are often coordinately produced by Th2 cells as in asthma .
However , it is unclear whether similar molecular mechanisms underlie transcription of the two genes .
We have previously shown that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and is crucial for activation of the IL-5 promoter by different stimuli .
In a different study , GATA-3 was shown to be sufficient for the expression of IL-4 and other Th2 cytokine genes .
Here , we show that ectopic expression of GATA-3 is sufficient to drive IL-5 but not IL-4 gene expression .
Also , in Th2 cells , antisense GATA-3 RNA inhibits IL-5 but not IL-4 promoter activation .
The induction of IL-5 gene expression by GATA-3 involves high affinity binding of GATA-3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL-5 promoter .
To characterize further the function of the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , we have developed stable transfectant variants of a vitamin D-responsive cell line ( U937 ) which express either decreased or increased numbers of VDR .
In this study we have analyzed changes in gene expression associated with this variable VDR expression .
Initial experiments indicated that a 50 % decrease in VDR levels was associated with a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation and a similar rise in c-myc mRNA expression .
Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display ( DD ) .
Sequence analysis of DD products revealed two cDNAs with identity to known gene products : the catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase ( DNA-PK(CS) ) , and the peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV ( 17beta-HSD IV ) .
Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both mRNAs was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of VDR .
Down-regulation of 17beta-HSD IV mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by U937 cells , suggesting a link between estrogenic pathways and cell proliferation .
Further Northern analyses indicated that there was no significant change in 17beta-HSD IV or DNA-PK(CS) mRNA levels following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 , although expression of both genes varied with changes in cell proliferation .
These data suggest that , in addition to its established role as a hormone-dependent trans-activator , VDR may influence gene expression by ligand-independent mechanisms .
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : To further analyze the neonatal immune response to an antigenic challenge such as blood transfusion , c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression were analyzed in twelve in-vitro-stimulated normal cord blood and ten in-vitro-stimulated normal adult peripheral blood lymphocyte samples .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Lymphocyte samples were stimulated by either the mitogen phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) or the monoclonal antibody alphaCD3 .
Proliferation rate and Northern blot hybridization were employed .
RESULTS : Cord lymphocytes revealed a greater proliferation rate with PHA and alphaCD3 than adult lymphocytes ( p = 0.0081 and 0.0023 , respectively ) .
In addition , Northern blot analysis of cord and adult samples revealed similar maximal increases in c-fos ( 99+/-15 and 126+/-11 % , p = 0.0126 ) and c-jun ( 123+/-9 and 185+/-38 % , p = 0.0291 ) mRNA expression , respectively , as early as 15 min post-alphaCD3 stimulation .
Adult lymphocytes showed an equivalent increase in mRNA expression of c-fos and c-jun ( 140+/-25 and 155+/-31 % ) at 30 min post-PHA stimulation , while cord lymphocyte maximum c-fos and c-jun expression ( 82+/-6 and 142+/-12 % ) occurred at 15 min post-PHA stimulation ( c-fos , p = 0.0354 ; c-jun , p = 0.0112 ) .
CONCLUSION : Although cord lymphocyte proliferation rates were significantly greater than those of adult lymphocytes following stimulation , lymphocyte activation , as analyzed by c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression , appears similar in both cord and adult samples .
We conclude that cord lymphocyte activation exhibits an adult-type profile .
Coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) catalyzes the sixth step of the heme biosynthetic pathway .
To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the CPO gene promoter , mouse genomic DNA clones for CPO were isolated .
Structural analysis demonstrated that the mouse CPO gene spans approximately 11 kb and consists of seven exons , just like its human counterpart .
Functional analysis of the promoter by transient transfection assays indicated that synergistic action between an SP-1-like element at -21/-12 , a GATA site at -59/-54 , and a novel regulatory element , CPRE ( -GGACTACAG- ) at -49/-41 , is essential for the promoter activity in murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells .
In nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells , however , the GATA site is not required .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed with each element , and that there are cell-specific differences in factors , which bind to the SP-1-like element between MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
These results provide evidence for differential regulation of the promoter function of CPO gene between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .

Apoptosis is responsible for the removal of potentially autoreactive or useless T cells during thymic selection and activated T cells in the periphery .
Specific families of receptors , kinases , transcription factors , and cysteine proteases , termed caspases , are involved in the apoptotic cascade leading to proteolysis of specific substrates and to morphological changes associated with programmed cell death .
Although common members of the apoptotic cascade are shared between different cell types , it appears that cell-specific factors can influence the response to a given apoptotic stimuli .
Characterization and understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the different pathways protecting or leading to cell death may provide novel ways to control inappropriate apoptosis involved in several diseases .
Proliferative and secretory responses in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells are regulated by steroid and peptide hormones and by differentiation-promoting substances .
In the present study , we evaluated whether peripheral blood monocytes that exhibit anti-tumour activity in haematopoietic and solid tumours influence growth and secretion in the LNCaP cell line .
For this purpose , LNCaP cells were incubated with monocyte-conditioned medium ( MCM ) , and proliferation as well as expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) and secretion of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) were assessed .
Conditioned medium from monocytes reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner .
Incubation with 40 % MCM caused a 50 % reduction in cell proliferation .
AR protein decreased by 70 % and PSA levels in supernatants from LNCaP cells were reduced by approximately 80 % following treatment with MCM .
We focused on the contribution of two major products of activated monocytes , prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 1beta ( IL-1beta ) , to the MCM modulatory action .
LNCaP cells treated with prostaglandin E2 showed neither a reduction in proliferation nor a down-regulation of AR and PSA levels .
The effects of MCM on cellular proliferation , AR protein and PSA secretion were abolished by pretreatment of MCM with a neutralizing anti-IL-1beta antibody .
In addition , recombinant IL-1beta was able to replace MCM for the inhibition of proliferation and down-regulation of AR and PSA proteins .
LNCaP cells were shown to express the IL-1beta receptor type 1 , which transduces IL-1beta signal .
Our findings reveal that monocyte-derived IL-1beta inhibits the proliferation of androgen-responsive prostate tumour cells and reduces AR and PSA levels .
A recent clinical therapeutic initiative has been the use of chemical agents which induce the leukaemic cells to overcome their block in differentiation .
In order to understand this block the cascade of molecular events needs to be characterized .
Haemopoietic differentiation is ultimately controlled at the level of gene transcription which is mediated by an array of transcription factors .
Many transcription factors contain similar structural protein sequences , and we have used an RT-PCR-based approach to isolate sequences , from transcription factor gene families which share similar domains .
Degenerate primers corresponding to the TFIIIA zinc-finger consensus amino acid sequences and to the POU-homeodomain and POU-specific domain were used to amplify genes on the basis that they contained similarities in structural motifs shared within these families of transcription factors .
A serum-independent HL60 cell line was induced towards the neutrophil lineage by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) for 24 h .
CD38+ cells committed towards this lineage were enriched and a population of these cells treated with dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce neutrophil maturation .
RNA extracted from uninduced , ATRA-induced CD38+ cells , and vitamin D3 treated maturing cell cultures were amplified using the degenerate primers .
PCR fragments were cloned , sequenced , clustered into homologous groups , and the group sequences searched on the GenBank database .
The Oct 1 transcription factor , and a very close homologue , KIAA0144 , was identified using the POU family primers .
The zinc-finger primers identified three zinc-finger genes .
The pattern of gene expression was suggested from the number of clones in each group at neutrophil commitment and maturation .
The differential expression of the genes in the zinc finger and POU families will lead to a better understanding of the cascade of gene expression which occurs following ATRA-induced differentiation .
Expression of human MHC HLA-DRA class II gene can be up-regulated in B cells by Ig cross-linking as well as by phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) .
Induced DRA expression involves activation of restricted protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms , resulting in activated activator protein-1-dependent transcription .
In this report expression profiles and activation of PKC were analyzed in human Raji B lymphoblastoid cells .
Transient transfection analysis with target plasmids containing either DRA promoter ( wild-type or mutated ) or TPA response elements demonstrated that pretreatment with the selective PKC inhibitor GF 109203X repressed TPA-mediated activation .
Western analysis performed on cellular fractions of resting cells and of TPA-activated cells revealed abundant expression of classical PKC-alpha ( cPKC-alpha ) , cPKC-betaII , and atypical PKC-zeta isoforms and identified a sustained translocation of cPKC-alpha and cPKC-betaII from the cytosolic compartment to membranes .
As expected , the distribution of atypical PKC-zeta was unaffected by TPA treatment and displayed an even distribution between cytosol and membranes .
This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy .
The TPA-mediated translocation of cPKC-alpha and cPKC-betaII was not influenced by pretreatment with GF 109203X .
Finally , functional activation and translocation of PKC were investigated with a selective in vitro kinase assay .
Together , these results show that activated HLA-DRA expression in response to TPA treatment is strictly dependent on PKC activation acting on the X2 box of the DRA promoter and that selective inhibition of PKC enzymatic activity does not influence subcellular localization of expressed PKC isoenzymes .
Thus , the translocation event per se occurs independently of PKC activation in these cells .
Work reported over the past year has provided insights into the mechanisms whereby ligand activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) regulates systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis .
PPARgamma has also been implicated recently in the biology of monocytes and in cell-cycle regulation and cancer .
Polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids bind and activate PPARgamma , suggesting that these lipids may serve as hormonal regulators of a variety of biological processes .
Human lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) is a hydrolase required for the cleavage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides derived from plasma lipoproteins .
It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation , the expression of LAL-mRNA is induced .
This induction is dependent on protein kinase C activity and protein synthesis .
The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP-1 cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation .
The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters .
In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate ( PMA ) -enhanced promoter activity , we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays .
A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells .
Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression .
Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2 .
Mononuclear phagocytes play a major role in immune and inflammatory responses .
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces monocytes to express a variety of genes by activating the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factor family .
Recently , we have reported that the tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 signaling pathways activate two kinases , IKK1 and IKK2 .
Phosphorylation of the IkappaB cytoplasmic inhibitors , IkappaBalpha , IkappaBbeta , and IkappaBepsilon , by these kinases triggers proteolytic degradation and the release of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins into the nucleus .
At present , the role of the IKKs in LPS signaling has not been investigated .
Here , we report that LPS induces IKK activity in human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells .
The kinetics of activation of kinase activity in monocytic cells are relatively slow with maximal activity observed at 60 min , which coincides with the degradation of IkappaBs and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB .
In transfection experiments , overexpression of wild type IKK1 , a dominant negative mutant IKK1 ( K44M ) , or wild type IKK2 did not affect LPS-induced kappaB-dependent transcription in monocytic cells .
In contrast , a dominant negative mutant of IKK2 inhibited LPS induction of kappaB-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner .
These results indicate that LPS induction of kappaB-dependent gene expression in human monocytic cells requires activation of IKK2 .
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of bis[4-[2,4-dioxo-5-thiazolidinyl)methyl]phenyl] methane ( YM-268 ) , a thiazolidinedione derivative , on glucose uptake , adipocyte differentiation through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) activity in cultured cells .
YM268 and pioglitazone dose-dependently increased the 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells .
YM268 facilitated the insulin-stimulated triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and increased the mRNA expression of fatty acid-binding protein .
YM268 , with and without insulin , increased the mRNA expression of glucose transporter isoforms such as GLUT1 and GLUT4 , indicating enhancement of adipocyte differentiation .
Additionally , YM268 and pioglitazone showed activity of the PPARgamma ligand , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily responsible for adipogenesis .
To examine the possible involvement of the increased activity of PI 3-kinase in YM268-stimulated glucose uptake , the enzyme activity was estimated by measuring the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PI-3,4,5-P3 ) concentration in human monocytic cells .
Insulin dose-dependently increased the PI-3,4,5-P3 production but YM268 had no significant effect on the insulin-dependent and -independent PI 3-kinase activation .
These results indicate that the mechanism by which YM268 increased glucose uptake , may be accounted for in part by the enhancement of GLUT1 and GLUT4 expression through PPARgamma activation .
C-fos has been reported to be one of the immediate early genes in signal transduction systems after many kinds of stresses , including ionizing radiation .
Changes in c-fos expression induced by radiation therapy in tumor tissues have not yet been reported .
In this study , we have attempted to determine whether c-fos expression is induced by radiotherapy in human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to establish a possible correlation between c-fos expression and the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy .
Twenty-seven patients with tumors of the oral cavity , oropharynx , and maxillary sinus were examined , all of which were confirmed as squamous cell carcinomas .
After obtaining the patients ' informed consent , biopsies were performed before treatment and at doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy of radiotherapy , and the specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen for further examination .
Serial sectioning of 6 micrometer was performed using a cryostat , and samples were immunohistochemically stained using the streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method and a monoclonal antibody against c-fos .
Three of the 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma showed slight expression of c-fos in their tumor cells before and/or at 4 or 10 Gy of radiotherapy .
The tumors showed high radiosensitivity .
Concerning tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , the rate of moderate or remarkable grades of c-fos-positive lymphocytes before radiotherapy and at radiation doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy was 8.0 , 29.2 , 4.8 , and 0 % , respectively .
The relationship between the immunohistochemical findings and the antitumor effect at a radiation dose of 20 Gy was examined on the corresponding H & E-stained sections .
In patients whose infiltration of c-fos-positive lymphocytes into tumor tissues were moderate or remarkable at 4 Gy of radiotherapy , the tumors responded significantly well to radiation therapy ( P < 0.025 , chi2 test ) , and the patients took a significantly favorable clinical course ( P < 0.05 , chi2 test ) .
In a sample from one of the patients , c-fos-positive lymphocytes were identified as CD4 positive and CD8 negative .
Therefore , the high radiosensitivity of squamous cell carcinomas in our samples could be explained by an overexpression of c-fos in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes induced by small doses of radiation therapy , and these activated lymphocytes exerted a cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells .
Irrespective of the etiology , many kidney diseases result in inflammation and fibrosis of the tubulointerstitium , with the subsequent loss of renal function .
To initiate any disease process or for any disease process to progress , there must be changes in the transcription of genes within the affected tissue .
The nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) family of transcription factors regulates genes involved in inflammation , cell proliferation , and cell differentiation .
This review discusses the NF-kappaB transcription factor family in general and the association of NF-kappaB activation with cellular/molecular events of renal inflammation and fibrosis .
Previously , we have shown that TAL1 and the LIM-only protein gene ( LMO ) are regularly coactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) .
This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice .
To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation , we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO by a subtractive PCR method .
One of the isolated genes , that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( RALDH2 ) , was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO .
Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO , but not either alone , induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line , HPB-ALL , not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO .
The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were , however , mostly initiated within the second intron .
Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation , and GATA3 binds to this site .
In addition , forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO , and these three factors formed a complex in vivo .
Furthermore , a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3 .
Collectively , we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
In this case , TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2 .
Hox11 is a homeobox gene essential for spleen formation in mice , since atrophy of the anlage of a developing spleen occurs in early embryonic development in Hox11 null mice .
HOX11 is also expressed in a subset of T-cell acute leukemias after specific chromosomal translocations .
Since the protein has a homeodomain and can activate transcription , it probably exerts at least some of its effects in vivo by regulation of target genes .
Representational difference analysis has been used to isolate cDNA clones corresponding to mRNA species activated following stable expression of HOX11 in NIH 3T3 cells .
The gene encoding the retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( Aldh1 ) , initially called Hdg-1 , was found to be ectopically activated by HOX11 in this system .
Study of Aldh1 gene expression during spleen development showed that the presence of Aldh1 mRNA inversely correlated with Hox11 .
Hox11 null mouse embryos have elevated Aldh1 mRNA in spleen primordia prior to atrophy , while Aldh1 seems to be repressed by Hox11 during organogenesis of the spleens of wild-type mice .
This result suggests that expression of Aldh1 protein is negatively regulated by Hox11 and that abnormal expression of Aldh1 in Hox11 null mice may cause loss of splenic precursor cells by aberrant retinoic acid metabolism .
Human monocytic cells express interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) when stimulated with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein , fibronectin ( FN ) .
Protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation is considered important for this process ; however , the metabolic steps at which PKC acts upon to mediate the FN-induced IL-1beta response remain unclear .
We performed an analysis of the mechanisms by which two PKC inhibitors , Calphostin C and Staurosporine , prevent the FN-induced IL-1beta response .
Both inhibitors blocked the secretion of IL-1beta protein into the media of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to FN .
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that under these circumstances , Calphostin C inhibited the production of IL-1beta protein , whereas Staurosporine allowed protein production , but inhibited its secretion .
To determine the mechanisms responsible for these differences , we turned to human U937 promonocytic cells .
U937 cells transfected with the human full-length IL-1beta promoter connected to a luciferase reporter gene were submitted to transcription assays , Northern blotting , and DNA electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays .
These studies revealed that Calphostin C inhibited the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) which is considered necessary for FN induction of IL-1beta gene transcription , and prevented the transcription of the IL-1beta gene .
In contrast , Staurosporine alone induced AP-1 translocation and stimulation of the gene .
Overall , our data indicate that Calphostin C prevents the transcription of the IL-1beta gene thereby inhibiting protein synthesis .
Based on the high specificity of this compound for PKC , we conclude that PKC is necessary for FN-induced IL-1beta protein production .
In contrast , Staurosporine prevented secretion of IL-1beta by unknown mechanisms .
A procedure suitable for cloning labile mRNAs that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU-DD ) .
These motifs are regulatory sequences within the so-called AU-rich elements ( AREs ) often found in 3' untranslated regions of genes such as cytokines , proto-oncogenes , and transcription factors .
AU-DD is an AU-motif-directed differential display that permits the identification of ARE-containing genes differentially expressed after cell activation .
It has been applied to peripheral blood monocytes and a T cell clone to isolate 59 cDNA fragments associated to activation .
Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are cytokines and transduction/transcription factors .
The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown genes of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed .
These data demonstrate the efficiency of the system and support the notion that numerous genes falling into those categories remain unidentified and that they can be cloned by this method .

Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) are important cytokines for the proliferation , differentiation , and activation of myeloid lineages .
The JAK/STAT pathway is one of the signaling pathways implicated in mediating biological responses induced by these cytokines .
Previous studies have demonstrated that these cytokines predominantly activate an 80 kDa STAT5 isoform in mature granulocytes .
To better understand the role of STAT proteins during growth and differentiation of granulocytes , we evaluated differentiation of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo toward eosinophils and neutrophils .
Bandshift experiments showed that in an early stage of both differentiation pathways ( 14 days ) , the 94 kDa STAT5B protein was activated by both IL-5 ( eosinophil lineage ) and GM-CSF ( neutrophil lineage ) .
However , during maturation of both lineages ( days 21 and 28 ) , increased expression of a functionally distinct 80 kDa STAT5 isoform was observed , resulting in heterodimer DNA-binding complexes containing both the 94 and 80 kDa STAT5 proteins .
The finding that functionally distinct isoforms of STAT5 are activated during the early and late differentiation stages of granulocytes suggests that they might be involved in regulating different biological functions in these cells .
Recently , the transcription factor GATA-3 was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and to augment Th2-specific cytokines .
Here , we show that loss of GATA-3 expression by developing Th1 cells requires IL-12 signaling through Stat4 and does not simply result from an absence of IL-4 .
Moreover , we demonstrate a novel role for GATA-3 in directly repressing Th1 development distinct from its positive actions on Th2-specific cytokines .
GATA-3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL-4 and that may involve repression of IL-12 signaling .
Thus , GATA-3 expression and IL-12 signaling are mutually antagonistic , which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development , producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles .
The conventional means of studying Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) memory , by in vitro stimulation with the latently infected autologous lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) , has important limitations .
First , it gives no information on memory to lytic cycle antigens ; second , it preferentially amplifies the dominant components of latent antigen-specific memory at the expense of key subdominant reactivities .
Here we describe an alternative approach , based on in vitro stimulation with epitope peptide-loaded dendritic cells ( DCs ) , which allows one to probe the CTL repertoire for any individual reactivity of choice ; this method proved significantly more efficient than stimulation with peptide alone .
Using this approach we first show that reactivities to the immunodominant and subdominant lytic cycle epitopes identified by T cells during primary EBV infection are regularly detectable in the CTL memory of virus carriers ; this implies that in such carriers chronic virus replication remains under direct T-cell control .
We further show that subdominant latent cycle reactivities to epitopes in the latent membrane protein LMP2 , though rarely undetectable in LCL-stimulated populations , can be reactivated by DC stimulation and selectively expanded as polyclonal CTL lines ; the adoptive transfer of such preparations may be of value in targeting certain EBV-positive malignancies .
Thymic dendritic cells ( DC ) mediate negative selection at a relatively late stage of the T-cell developmental pathway .
We present evidence that the development of thymic DC and of T-lineage cells is linked via a common precursor at an early stage of thymocyte development .
T-lineage precursor populations from the adult mouse thymus , prior to T-cell receptor gene rearrangement , display a capacity to produce DC as well as T cells in the thymus , and are very efficient precursors of DC in culture .
These lymphoid/DC precursors have little capacity to form myeloid cells , indicating that thymic DC are a lymphoid-related rather than myeloid-related lineage .
In contrast to myeloid-related DC , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is not required for the development of these lymphoid-related DC in vivo or in vitro .
DC can develop in mutant mice lacking mature T cells , provided the common precursors are present .
However , in mutant mice lacking functional Ikaros transcription factors , there are deficiencies in lymphoid precursor cells , in mature lymphoid cells and in DC .
Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( RANK ) is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is expressed on activated T cells and dendritic cells .
Its cognate ligand ( RANKL ) plays significant roles in the activation of dendritic cell function and osteoclast differentiation .
We demonstrate here the interaction of RANK with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 both in vitro and in cells .
Mapping of the structural requirements for TRAF/RANK interaction revealed multiple TRAF binding sites clustered in two distinct domains in the RANK cytoplasmic tail .
These TRAF binding domains were shown to be functionally important for the RANK-dependent induction of NF-kappaB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activities .
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these TRAF binding sites exhibited selective binding for different TRAF proteins .
In particular , TRAF6 interacted with membrane-proximal determinants distinct from those binding TRAFs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 .
When this membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted , RANK-mediated NF-kappaB signaling was completely inhibited while c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation was partially inhibited .
An NH2-terminal truncation mutant of TRAF6 inhibited RANKL-mediated NF-kappaB activation , but failed to affect constitutive signaling induced by receptor overexpression , revealing a selective role for TRAF6 in ligand-induced activation events .
A human dendritic cell-based assay used to monitor a T cell proliferation response to viral peptides in vitro is described .
Dendritic cells and autologous CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood by a series of density-gradient centrifugations or magnetic bead separations ( or both ) .
Peptides corresponding to residues of the immediate early protein , IE62 , of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) were used as stimulating antigens , and persons with no history of varicella and no humoral or cellular immunity to VZV served as naive donors for the assays .
Three VZV-susceptible donors were tested , and all demonstrated an in vitro response to multiple VZV peptides .
This assay has potential as a screen to establish the immunogenicity of viral antigens in vitro using T cells from naive donors .
Glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and 3-O-methyl-D glucose ( 3-O-MG ) transport were determined in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) from 11 abdominal obese subjects , 10 pituitary-dependent Cushing 's syndrome ( Cushing 's disease ) and 10 healthy controls .
Using a whole-cell competitive binding assay and 3H-dexamethasone as tracer , MNL of abdominal obese subjects were found to have 4855 +/- 1389 sites/cell which was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than controls ( 6234 +/- 1568 sites/cell ) , although no significant difference was found in the mean serum cortisol level .
Their mean Kd ( affinity ) was also significantly lower than that found in the healthy controls ( obese Kd : 2.92 +/- 0.84 nmol/l , control Kd : 4.55 +/- 0.67 nM , p < 0.05 ) .
On the other hand , the receptor characteristics in Cushing 's disease patients were within the normal range .
At the same time , 3-O-MG transport was determined in the same subjects .
In Cushing 's disease , 3-O-MG transport was within the normal range , whereas in abdominal obesity this value was significantly lower than the healthy controls ( abdominal obese : 31.90 +/- 8.20 ; control : 46.26 +/- 12.91 fmol/10(6) cell , min , p < 0.05 ) .
We also found a positive correlation between 3-O-MG transport and GR binding capacity in abdominal subjects ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.001 ) , however we did not find such a correlation in Cushing 's disease ( r = 0.60 , p > 0.05 ) .
These results indicated that , in abdominal obesity , the GR binding capacity in MNL is influenced by the changes in glucose transport .
Phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , which is described as an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity , inhibits H2O2 release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) as measured by electrochemistry .
Since human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is known to be favored under oxidative stress conditions , ex vivo experiments using uninfected PBMCs , primary monocytes or a latently infected promonocytic U1 cell line show that HIV-1 replication and reactivation , monitored by p24 antigen measurement , are inhibited by PAO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner .
These observations can be linked with the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation when uninfected monocytes are induced by either tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
We have analyzed the effects of interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) on the entry of quiescent CD4(+) T cells into the cell cycle upon stimulation with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) .
IL-10 arrested cells at G0/G1 .
IL-10 treatment prevented the downregulation of p27(Kip1) , an inhibitory protein that controls progression out of the G0 phase of the cell cycle .
IL-10 also prevented the upregulation of the G1 cyclins D2 and D3 , proteins necessary for entry and progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle .
Associated with the inhibition of the cell cycle , IL-10 suppressed SEB induction of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
Addition of exogenous IL-2 to IL-10-treated cells significantly reversed the antiproliferative effects of IL-10 .
Moreover , IL-10 effects on the early G1 proteins p27(Kip1) and cyclin D2 were similarly reversed by exogenous IL-2 .
Although this reversal by IL-2 was pronounced , it was not complete , suggesting that IL-10 may have some effects not directly related to the suppression of IL-2 production .
Cell separation experiments suggest that IL-10 can effect purified CD4(+) T cells directly , providing functional evidence for the presence of IL-10 receptors on CD4(+) T cells .
IL-10 also inhibited expression of IL-2 transcriptional regulators c-fos and c-jun , which also inhibit other cell functions .
Our studies show that the mechanism of IL-10 regulation of quiescent CD4(+) T-cell activation is mainly by blocking induction of IL-2 that is critical to downregulation of p27(Kip1) and upregulation of D cyclins in T-cell activation and entry into the cell cycle .
Environmental estrogens or estrogen disrupters have recently received a great deal of attention because of their potential health impact on reproductive tissues .
Few , if any , studies have been made on the impact of these compounds on the immune system .
We sought to determine the activities of various environmental estrogens on the modulation of the interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene in a model monocytic cell line , hER + IL-1beta-CAT+ .
This cell line stably transfected with the human estrogen receptor , and an IL-1beta promoter construct fused to the CAT reporter gene allows us to monitor the effect of estrogenic compounds on IL-1beta promoter activity .
17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) markedly enhanced lipopolysaccharide- ( LPS ) induced IL-1beta promoter-driven CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner .
The mycotoxins alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone both exhibited full agonist activity , but at lower potencies , with EC50 values of 1.8 and 54 nM , respectively , compared with E2 at 0.5 nM .
In addition , genistein was a very low-potency agonist , having an EC50 of 1.5 microM .
Similar to the E2 response , the slope factors for alpha-zearalenol , zearalenone , and genistein were close to 3.0 , suggesting positive cooperativity in the estrogenic response .
The activity of the mycotoxins appeared to be mediated through the estrogen receptor , since both the antiestrogens H1285 and ICI 182 , 780 effectively inhibited their agonist activity in a dose-dependent manner .
Representative environmental estrogenic compounds both from plant and industrial sources were also tested .
Unlike the mycoestrogens , none of the compounds , with the exception of genistein , synergized with LPS to enhance IL-1beta promoter activity .
When tested for antiestrogenic activity , the industrial compound 4-octylphenol was able to antagonize the response to E2 ; however , the response was three orders of magnitude less potent than H 1285 .
Naringenin , a plant flavonoid , showed little or no ability to antagonize the response to E2 .
Overall , the results show that some environmental estrogens that display agonist activity in reproductive tissue also have an effect on IL-1 gene expression in hemopoietic-derived tissue .
The physiological role of the pro-myelocytic leukaemia ( PML ) gene product is poorly defined .
Among other functions , PML is involved in haematopoietic differentiation and in control of cell growth and tumorigenesis .
We investigated the regulation of human PML expression by interferons ( IFNs ) and IL-1 in various human haematopoietic lines ( U937 , THP1 , HL60 , NB4 ) , in human diploid fibroblasts and in human peripheral blood leukocytes .
Cytokine-induced modulation of PML expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses , flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling .
Our data show that IFNs and IL-1 upregulate PML transcript and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner .
In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by IFN-alpha is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so-called PML nuclear bodies .
Our data suggest that stimulation of PML expression by interferons and IL-1 may account for upregulation of PML proteins observed in inflammatory tissues and in proliferative states .
We compared U-937 cell adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical venous ( HUVECs ) and arterial ( HUAECs ) endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin-1 , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
TNF and LPS stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 surface expression and adhesion of U-937 monocyte-like cells to HUVECs but not to HUAECs .
Antibody studies demonstrated that in HUVECs at least 75 % of the adhesion response is VCAM-1 mediated .
Interleukin-1 stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to and VCAM-1 surface expression in both HUVECs and HUAECs .
Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked TNF- and LPS-stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to HUVECs .
These agents also significantly decreased TNF- and LPS-stimulated increases in HUVEC surface VCAM-1 .
TNF increased VCAM-1 protein and mRNA in HUVECs that was blocked by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate .
However , neither TNF or LPS stimulated VCAM-1 expression in HUAECs .
TNF stimulated expression of both intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs , but in HUAECs , only intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was increased .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated no difference in the pattern of TNF-stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB activation between HUVECs and HUAECs .
These studies demonstrate a novel and striking insensitivity of arterial endothelium to the effects of TNF and LPS and indicate a dissociation between the ability of HUAECs to upregulate nuclear factor-kappaB and VCAM-1 .
The expression of tissue factor ( TF ) , the principal initiator of coagulation , is increased during inflammation and atherosclerosis .
Both conditions are promoted by lysophosphatidylcholine ( lysoPC ) .
We observed in the present study that lysoPC ( 1 to 10 micromol/L ) dose-dependently reduced TF activity in human monocytes , as elicited by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Lysophosphatidylethanolamine ( lysoPE ) and other lysophospholipids did not affect LPS-induced TF activity of human monocytes .
TF antigen expression as elicited by LPS was also lowered by lysoPC .
Phospholipid analyses indicated a selective increase in the lysoPC content of the monocytes after preincubation with the lysophospholipid .
LysoPC inhibited the TF activity of Mono Mac-6 cells to a similar extent as in the monocytes .
LPS binding to plasma membrane receptors and internalization of LPS into monocytes were not affected by lysoPC .
In contrast , LPS-mediated nuclear binding of nuclear factor-kappaB/Rel to a TF-specific kappaB site was inhibited by lysoPC .
Induction of TF mRNA expression by LPS tended to be partially reduced by the lysophospholipid .
Preincubation with lysoPC increased monocytic cAMP levels .
Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by pretreatment with 2'-deoxy-3'-adenosine monophosphate partially reversed the inhibition of TF activity promoted by lysoPC .
In conclusion , lysoPC markedly decreases LPS-mediated TF expression of human monocytes , the effect probably being mediated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms .
LysoPC may thus attenuate activation of coagulation during inflammation and atherosclerosis .
A reduced expression of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) in parathyroid glands of uremic animals and humans has been observed .
Similar results have been obtained by our own group in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal failure .
However , the reasons for these changes are not clear .
In the present study , we have investigated the specific uptake of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 by PBMC of 11 women with advanced chronic renal failure ( A-CRF ) , 6 women with mild-moderate renal insufficiency ( M-CRF ) , and 23 healthy women .
The mean dissociation constant ( KD ) was similar in both groups of patients and in healthy women ( A-CRF : 0.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(-10) M ; M-CRF : 1.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(-10) M ; controls : 1.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(-10) M ) .
However , VDR concentration was significantly decreased in A-CRF ( 0.8 +/- 0.5 fmol/10(7) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(7) cells in controls , p < 0.001 ) , whereas no changes were seen in M-CRF ( 1.7 +/- 0.7 fmol/10(7) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(7) cells in controls ) .
No correlation was seen between VDR and serum calcitriol or PTH levels , when considering both groups of patients together or separately .
Conversely , a significant negative correlation was found between VDR and serum creatinine values when A-CRF and M-CRF were considered altogether ( r = -0.63 ; p < 0.01 ) .
Treatment with two different schedules of oral calcitriol ( five patients with 0.5 microgram/day for 1 month and four patients with 2 micrograms/day for 7 days ) did not change VDR concentrations .
We conclude that the low levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D3 of uremia are not responsible for the decrease in VDR concentration found in these patients .
The active metabolite of vitamin D , 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 , is an important immunoregulatory hormone [ 1 ] .
Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor , which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes .
Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases : tuberculosis , malaria , and hepatitis B virus .
Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 ( genotype tt ) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis ( chi2 = 6.22 , 1 df , P = .01 ) and persistent hepatitis B infection ( chi2 = 6.25 , 1 df , P = .01 ) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes .
Therefore , this genetic variant , which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations , may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases .
Two variants of the IL-4R alpha-chain ( IL-4Ralpha ) gene have been recently identified in association with different atopic disorders .
To clarify the etiological relationship between the two variants , we analyzed responsiveness to IL-4 of transfectants with four kinds of IL-4Ralpha carrying either Val or Ile at 50 and either Gln or Arg at 551 .
The substitution of Ile for Val augmented STAT6 activation , proliferation , and transcription activity of the Iepsilon promoter by IL-4 , whereas that of Arg for Gln did not change these IL-4 signals .
Arg551 was not associated with atopic asthma in the Japanese population .
CD23 expression and IgE synthesis by IL-4 were augmented in Ile50-bearing PBMC , compared with those bearing Val50 .
Taken together , substitution of Arg551 does not enhance the IL-4 signal for generation of germline epsilon transcript , whereas the substitution of Ile50 contributes to enhancement of IgE synthesis .
Using the coiled-coil region of Stat5b as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen , we identified the association of Nmi , a protein of unknown function previously reported as an N-Myc interactor .
We further show that Nmi interacts with all STATs except Stat2 .
We evaluated two cytokine systems , IL-2 and IFNgamma , and demonstrate that Nmi augments STAT-mediated transcription in response to these cytokines .
Interestingly , Nmi lacks an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain ; instead , Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5 , and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription .
Therefore , our data not only reveal that Nmi can potentiate STAT-dependent transcription , but also suggest that it can augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of sequence-specific transcription factors .
