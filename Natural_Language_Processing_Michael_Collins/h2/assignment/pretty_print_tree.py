00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,193
One of the most elegant properties of
problems to graphical models is the

2
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:08,500
intricate connection between the
factorization of distribution as a product

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,580
of factors, and the independence
properties that it needs to satisfy. Now

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,773
we're going to talk about how that
connection manifests in the context of

5
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:21,420
directed graphical models or Bayesian
networks. So let's first remind ourselves

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,613
about why independence and factorization
are related to each other. So, for

7
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:30,373
example, the independence definition, that
P of X comma Y is the, is the product of

8
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:34,630
two factors. P of X and P of Y is the
definition of independence. At the same

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,729
time it's a fac
