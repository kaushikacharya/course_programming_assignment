## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

```{r}
wine = read.table("winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
# display headers
names(wine)
head(wine)
```

```{r}
# histogram plot
barplot(table(wine$quality))
```

```{r}
summary(wine)
```

Linear Regression
-----------------
```{r}
library(leaps)
```

```{r}
regfit.fwd = regsubsets(quality~., data = wine, method = "forward", nvmax = 12)
summary(regfit.fwd)
plot(regfit.fwd, scale = "Cp")
```

Create train and validation set
```{r}
n_samples = dim(wine)[1]
n_features = dim(wine)[2]-1
set.seed(1)
train = sample(seq(n_samples), floor(2*n_samples/3), replace = FALSE)
regfit.fwd = regsubsets(quality~., data = wine[train,], nvmax = n_features, method = "forward")
summary(regfit.fwd)
```

Now make predictions on validation data
```{r}
predict.regsubsets = function(object, newdata, id,...)
{
  form = as.formula(object$call[[2]])
  mat = model.matrix(form, newdata)
  coefi = coef(object, id=id)
  mat[,names(coefi)]%%coefi
}
```

```{r}
val.errors = rep(NA, n_features)
# iterate over each of the model
for (i in 1:n_features){
  pred = predict(regfit.fwd, wine[-train,], id = i)
  val.errors[i] = mean((wine[-train,]-pred)^2)
}

# plot the rmse
plot(sqrt(val.errors), ylab = "Root MSE", pch=19, type="b")
points(sqrt(regfit.fwd$rss[-1]),col="blue",pch=19,type="b")
legend("topright",legend=c("Training","Validation"),col=c("blue","black"),pch=19)
```


Classification
--------------
Create classes for classification using values of quality
```{r}
wine$taste = ifelse(wine$quality < 6, "bad", "good")
wine$taste[wine$quality == 6] = "normal"
wine$taste = as.factor(wine$taste)
```

```{r}
pairs(wine, col=wine$taste)
```

```{r}
require(randomForest)
```


```{r}
rf.fit = randomForest(taste~.-quality, data = wine, subset = train)
rf.fit
```

```{r}
pred = predict(rf.fit, newdata = wine[-train,])
table(wine[-train,"taste"], pred)
```
